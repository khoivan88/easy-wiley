      <title>Filling a Gap: The Coordinatively Saturated Group 4 Carbonyl Complexes TM(CO)8 (TM = Zr, Hf) and Ti(CO)7</title>
      <dc:description>Homoleptic group 4 metal&#8722;carbonyl cation and neutral complexes are prepared in the gas phase and/or in solid neon matrix. Infrared spectroscopy studies reveal that both zirconium and hafnium form octa&#8208;coordinate carbonyl neutral and cation complexes. In contrast, titanium forms only the six&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  6  +  and seven&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  7  . Titanium octacarbonyl Ti(CO)  8  is unstable due to steric repulsion between the CO ligands. The 20&#8208;electron Zr(CO)  8  and Hf(CO)  8  complexes represent the first experimentally observed homoleptic octacarbonyl neutral complexes of transition metals. The molecules still fulfill the 18 electron rule, because one doubly occupied valence orbital does not mix with any of the metal valence atomic orbitals. Zr(CO)  8  and Hf(CO)  8  are stable against the loss of one CO because the CO ligands encounter less steric repulsion than Zr(CO)  7  and Hf(CO)  7  . The heptacarbonyls have shorter metal&#8208;CO bonds than the octacarbonyls due to stronger electrostatic and covalent bonding, but the significantly smaller repulsive Pauli term makes the octacarbonyls stable. Our finding ends the decade&#8211;long search for the coordinately saturated group&#8208;4 carbonyl complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes: Progress, Challenges and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
How to prepare heterocycles: Ruthenium(II)&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is discussed, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although RuII centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many RuII&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that RuII centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In this Minireview, an overview of the RuII&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is provided, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

      <title>Photoinitiated Thiol&#8208;ene Reactions of Enoses: A Powerful Tool for Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics with Challenging Glycosidic Linkages</title>
      <dc:description>
UV&#8208;light induced radical&#8208;mediated addition of thiols onto endo&#8208; or exo&#8208;cyclic double bonds of unsaturated sugars offers an easy and stereoselective route to a broad range of stable glycomimetics including 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosides and new types of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
Thioglycosides and C&#8208;glycosides represent pharmacologically useful classes of glycomimetics that possess a high degree of biological stability. One emerging tool for the stereoselective synthesis of thioglycosides is the photoinitiated addition of thiols to unsaturated sugars. Moreover, thiyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions of exo&#8208;glycals and 1&#8208;substituted endo&#8208;glycals offer facile routes to &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosidic structures. This Concept article summarizes the thiol&#8208;ene coupling strategies developed recently by our group and Soms&#225;k's group for the synthesis of several kinds of glycomimetics which are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods. One unusual characteristic of the thiol&#8208;ene reactions of endo&#8208;glycals is that heating inhibits, whereas cooling promotes the reaction. This unique temperature dependence as well as the effects of the enose structures and thiol configurations on the efficacy and stereoselectivity of the reactions are also discussed.

      <title>Solvophobically Driven Complexation of Adamantyl Mannoside with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin in Water and Structured Organic Solvents</title>
      <dc:description>
Favorable guest conditions: The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin are explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract
The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin were explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Efficient binding was observed only in hydrogen&#8208;bonded solvents, which indicated solvophobically driven complexation. The stability of the inclusion complex was considerably higher in aqueous media. A pronounced temperature dependence of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675;, resulting in perfect enthalpy&#8211;entropy compensation, was observed in water. The complexation thermodynamics was in line with classical rationale for the hydrophobic effect at lower temperatures and the nonclassical explanation at higher temperatures. This finding linked cyclodextrin complexation thermodynamics with insights regarding the effect of temperature on the hydration water structure. The complexation enthalpies and entropies were weakly dependent on temperature in organic media. The signs of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675; were in accordance with the nonclassical hydrophobic (solvophobic) effect. The structures of the optimized product corresponded to those deduced spectroscopically, and the calculated and experimentally obtained values of &#916;rG&#9675; were in very good agreement. This investigation clearly demonstrated that solvophobically driven formation of cyclodextrin complexes could be anticipated in structured solvents in general. However, unlike in water, adamantane and the host cavity behaved solely as structure breakers in the organic media explored so far.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Chalcogen Bonds: CSD and DFT Analyses and Biological Implication in Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive influences: Searches in the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Database in combination with theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory) show the importance of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonding interactions in crystal structures and in the inhibition mechanism of sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase.







Abstract
This study reports a combined Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical DFT study of charge assisted chalcogen bonds involving sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium cations. The chalcogen bond has been recently defined by IUPAC as the net attractive interaction between an electrophilic region associated with a chalcogen atom in a molecular entity and a nucleophilic region in another, or the same, molecular entity. Divalent chalcogen atoms typically have up to two &#963;&#8208;holes and forms up to two ChBs; the same holds for tetravalent chalcogens which adopt a seesaw arrangement. In sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium salts chalcogen atoms form three covalent bonds, three &#963;&#8208;holes are located opposite to these bonds, and up to three charge assisted ChBs can be formed between these holes and the counterions. The covalent bond arrangement around these chalcogen atoms is similar to trivalent pnictogen atoms and translates into a similar pattern of noncovalent interactions. We have found and studied this type of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonds in various sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase, for example, salacinol and kotalanol.

      <title>[2+2] Photodimerization of Stilbazoles Promoted by Oxalic Acid in Suspension</title>
      <dc:description>
A very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.







Abstract
In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.

      <title>Light&#8208;driven flipping of azobenzene assemblies &#8213; sparse crystal structures and responsive behavior to polarized light</title>

In the anisotropic structure, a specific azobenzene molecule acts as a reaction centre for the conversion of light to a mechanical function process, while the other molecules act as modulators for spatio&#8208;pattern regulation.

      <title>Structural Tunability and Diversity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Lead Halide Benzenethiolate</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 (X=I, Br, or Cl), was synthesized and characterized with experimental and computational methods. These materials feature strong absorption, an extremely large Stokes Shift, and long carrier lifetimes. Interestingly, the bandgap can be tuned by choice of halide, with little to no effect on the photoluminescent emission.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials are currently of great interest for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Here, the synthesis and optical properties of a new type of halide&#8208;organothiolate&#8208;mixed 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3, are reported, in which X is a halide (I, Br, or Cl). Different from conventional lead&#8208;based 2D layered materials, these compounds feature unusual five&#8208;coordinated lead centers with a stereochemically active electron lone pair on the lead atoms and four&#8208;coordinated iodine atoms. The Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 materials feature an indirect bandgap, strongly emissive long&#8208;lived self&#8208;trap states, and an extremely large Stokes shift. Interestingly, the optical bandgap of the materials can be tuned through variation of the halides; however, the photoluminescence is less sensitive to the composition and is more likely dominated by lead&#8208;sulfur lattice interactions or the lead lone&#8208;pair electrons. Our results support that a halide&#8211;organothiolate mixed anion hybrid structure offers a unique platform for discovering new exciting 2D electronic materials.

      <title>Increasing the affinity of an O&#8208;antigen polysaccharide binding site in Shigella flexneri bacteriophage Sf6 tailspike protein</title>
      <dc:description>Broad and unspecific use of antibiotics accelerates spread of resistances. Sensitive and robust pathogen detection is thus important for a more targeted application. Bacteriophages contain a large repertoire of pathogen&#8208;binding proteins. These tailspike proteins (TSP) often bind surface glycans and represent a promising design platform for specific pathogen sensors. We analyzed bacteriophage Sf6 TSP that recognizes the O&#8208;polysaccharide of dysentery&#8208;causing  Shigella  (  S.  )  flexneri  to develop variants with increased sensitivity for sensor applications. Ligand polyrhamnose backbone conformations were obtained from 2D  1  H,  1  H&#8208;trNOESY NMR utilizing methine&#8208;methine and methine&#8208;methyl correlations. They agreed well with conformations obtained from molecular dynamics (MD), validating the method for further predictions. In a set of mutants, MD predicted ligand flexibilities that were in good correlation with binding strength as confirmed on immobilized  S. flexneri  O&#8208;polysaccharide with surface plasmon resonance.  In silico  approaches combined with rapid screening on PS surfaces hence provide valuable strategies for TSP&#8208;based pathogen sensor design.</dc:description>

We analyzed bacteriophage Sf6 TSP that recognizes the O&#8208;polysaccharide of dysentery&#8208;causing  Shigella  (  S.  )  flexneri  to develop variants with increased sensitivity for sensor applications. Ligand polyrhamnose backbone conformations were obtained from 2D  1  H,  1  H&#8208;trNOESY NMR utilizing methine&#8208;methine and methine&#8208;methyl correlations. They agreed well with conformations obtained from molecular dynamics (MD), validating the method for further predictions. In a set of mutants, MD predicted ligand flexibilities that were in good correlation with binding strength as confirmed on immobilized  S. flexneri  O&#8208;polysaccharide with surface plasmon resonance.  In silico  approaches combined with rapid screening on PS surfaces hence provide valuable strategies for TSP&#8208;based pathogen sensor design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Influence of Nucleophilic and Redox Pincer Character, and Alkali Metals, on Capture of Oxygen Substrates: The Case of Chromium(II)</title>
      <dc:description>Dimeric [CrL]  2  , where L is the conjugate base of  bis  &#8208;pyrazolyl pyridine, is evaluated for its ability to undergo inner sphere and outer sphere redox chemistry. It reacts with Cp  2  Fe  +  to give the surprising [Cr  4  (HL)  4  (&#956;  4  &#8208;O)]  2+  , still containing divalent Cr. Reduction (KC  8  ) of [CrL]  2  by 2 electrons gives [K  2  (THF)  3  Cr  3  L  3  (&#956;  3  &#8208;O)], and by 4 electrons gives [K  4  (THF)  10  Cr  2  L  2  (&#956;&#8208;O)], each of which has scavenged (hydr)oxide from glass surface because of the electrophilicity of the underligated Cr. The remarkable [K  4  (THF)  10  Cr  2  L  2  (&#956;&#8208;O)], is shown by comprehensive DFT calculations and analysis of intra&#8208;ligand bond lengths to contain a pyridyl radical L  3&#8722;  and Cr  II  , illustrating that this pincer is proton&#8208;responsive, redox active, and a versatile donor to associated K  +  ions here. The K  +  electrophiles interact with electron rich oxo, but do not significantly (&gt; 5 kcal/mol) alter spin state energies. Inner sphere oxidation of [CrL]  2  with a quinone gives [Cr  2  L  2  (semiquinone)  2  ], while pre&#8208;reduced [CrL]  2  2&#8722;  reacts with quinone to give [K  3  (THF)  3  Cr  2  L  2  (catecholate)  2  (&#956;&#8208;OH)], a product of capture of two undercoordinated LCr(catecholate)  1&#8722;  by hydroxide.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photoremovable protecting groups (PPG) have been exploited in a large set of chemical and biological applications, due to their ability to provide spatial and temporal control over light&#8208;triggered activation. In this work, we explore the concept of a new photocage compound based on the commercial UVA/UVB filter oxybenzone (OB, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone) for photoprotection and controlled release of carbonyl groups. The point here is that oxybenzone not only acts as a mere PPG, but also provides, once released, UV photoprotection to the carbonyl derivative.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>
Straightforward &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis: Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed. This reaction proceeds through an intramolecular Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation in the presence of a first&#8208;row transition metal, Cu catalyst, and no DG installation is needed (see scheme).







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs because of their ubiquity in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams using tBuOOtBu. This method is based on Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky amidation and does not require prefunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds or the installation of a directing group, thereby allowing for the straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams. Our intramolecular functionalization protocol can be extended to diverse benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and shows excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance.

     alt="Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Straightforward &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis&lt;/b&gt;: Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed. This reaction proceeds through an intramolecular Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky&#8208;type C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation in the presence of a first&#8208;row transition metal, Cu catalyst, and no DG installation is needed (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#946;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs because of their ubiquity in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams using &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu. This method is based on Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky amidation and does not require prefunctionalization of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds or the installation of a directing group, thereby allowing for the straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams. Our intramolecular functionalization protocol can be extended to diverse benzylic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds and shows excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Atom&#8208;Ratio&#8208;Conducted Tailoring of PdAu Bimetallic Nanocrystals with Distinctive Shapes and Dimensions for Boosting the ORR Performance
</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction: 2D PdAu porous nanosheets (PNSs) demonstrate outstanding oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction performance compare to 1D anisotropic nanowires (NWs), 3D penetrative nanofibers (NFs) and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels.







Abstract
Systematically manipulating the shape, dimension, and surface structure of PdAu nanocrystals is an active subject because it offers a powerful means to regulate and investigate their structure&#8211;activity relationship. Meanwhile, it is still urgent to reduce the use of two&#8208;dimensional precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials. This work demonstrates that PdAu nanocrystals with a variety of shapes/dimensions, including 1D anisotropic nanowires, 2D porous nanosheets, and 3D penetrative nanoflowers, can be systematically synthesized by simply adjusting the atomic ratio or the reaction time in the same protocol. The resultant PdAu nanocrystals with distinctive shapes, but the same building blocks triumphantly avoid the effects of facet and surface properties; this represents an ideal platform for directly comparing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. 2D porous PdAu nanosheets demonstrate superior ORR performance (Eonset = 1.040&#8197;V, E1/2 = 0.932&#8197;V) compared with other&#8208;dimension&#8208;based samples and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels. This work not only paves the way for systematically measuring a series of distinctive PdAu nanocrystals as non&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts, but also sheds light on the study of structures/dimensions in tuning the catalytic properties of bimetallic nanocrystals.

      <title>Sulfinyl&#8208;Mediated Stereoselective Functionalization of Acyclic Conjugated Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rearrangements: A methodology to prepare acyclic unsaturated 1,4&#8208;diol derivatives from conjugated sulfinyl dienes has been developed. A cascade process that entails nucleophilic addition to produce a functionalized allylic sulfoxide, followed by [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and sulfenate cleavage renders the target molecules with high yields and selectivities (see scheme).







Abstract
The chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled functionalization of conjugated sulfinyl dienes in a cascade process that involves a conjugate addition, diastereoselective protonation and a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is reported. Enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;diol and 1,4&#8208;aminoalcohol derivatives are obtained in a very straightforward manner. Further functionalization of these structures, including highly stereoselective epoxidation, dihydroxylation and the stereodivergent synthesis of several polyols in a controlled fashion is described.

      <title>How to Bend a Cumulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend it: [n]Cumulenes are known for the linearity of their carbon chains, but when the terminal groups are N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, this situation changes. The even cumulenes of this family can be bent depending on the &#960; acidity of the carbene terminal group. Poor &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the carbon chain to the terminal group promotes a significant bending in the carbon chain.







Abstract
Allenes (carbodicarbenes) and [3]cumulenes are linear carbon chains that can be bent when the terminal group has a strong carbene nature. This bending can be quite pronounced in allenes but not in [3]cumulenes. In this study, how N&#8208;heterocyclic or cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (NHC and CAAC, respectively) terminal groups can modify the linear structure of [n]cumulenes has been analyzed. A low &#960; acidity of the terminal carbene affects the linearity of [2n]cumulenes. Indeed, it has been found that the NHC [4]cumulene is extremely bent, contrary to classical [4]cumulenes. The predicted NHC [4]cumulene or tricarbodicarbene has two lone pairs and the &#960; electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule. More significantly, DFT calculations have shown that this bent [4]cumulene is very stable, considerably more so than the corresponding [3]cumulene, which has been elusive to synthesize. Remarkably, calculations have shown that all the NHC [2n]cumulenes are more than 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the [2n&#8722;1]cumulenes.

      <title>Bifunctional Catalysts for Reversible Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional oxygen catalysts require multiactive centers to catalyze both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Metal/heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon composites with abundant active centers have been proven to have outstanding performance when replacing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based bifunctional oxygen catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) and reversible fuel cells (RFCs) rely on the bifunctional oxygen catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finding efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts is the ultimate goal and it has attracted a great deal of attention. The dilemma is that a good ORR catalyst is not necessarily efficient for OER, and vice versa. Thus, the development of a new type of bifunctional oxygen catalysts should ensure that the catalysts exhibit high activity for both OER and ORR. Composites with multicomponents for active centers supported on highly conductive matrices could be able to meet the challenges and offering new opportunities. In this Review, the evolution of bifunctional catalysts is summarized and discussed aiming to deliver high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials.

The dilemma is that a good ORR catalyst is not necessarily efficient for OER, and vice versa. Thus, the development of a new type of bifunctional oxygen catalysts should ensure that the catalysts exhibit high activity for both OER and ORR. Composites with multicomponents for active centers supported on highly conductive matrices could be able to meet the challenges and offering new opportunities. In this Review, the evolution of bifunctional catalysts is summarized and discussed aiming to deliver high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Facile Grinding Method for the Synthesis of 3D Ag Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Containing Ag6Mo7O24 for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
The daily grind: Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) compounds are successfully synthesized by a simple grinding method. The resulting {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) has the high specific capacitance of 971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (higher than other compounds), excellent rate ability, and long cycle stability. In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Successful synthesis of three kinds of dynamically stable compounds by a simple grinding method is reported, giving Ag6Mo7O24, Ag&#8208;BTC (Ag&#8208;MOF, BTC=benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid), and {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). According to the electrochemical dynamic analysis, these materials have pseudocapacitor behavior and high capacitance. The unique nanorod structure of {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF provides more active sites, faster ion/electron transfer, and electrolyte diffusion pathways, resulting in excellent specific capacitance (971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) higher than the other compounds. {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) also has an excellent rate ability (60.1&#8201;%) and long cycle stability (98&#8201;% retention after 5000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery (with nickel foam as the current collector) fabricated with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V. These results demonstrate a new simple grinding method to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) for high&#8208;performance materials.

      <title>Are Hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes Aromatic or Not? A DFT Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>
Calculating substitutes: Aromaticity dependence is found in hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes. Specifically, metallazapentalene exhibits comparable aromaticity to that of metallapentalene, whereas lower aromaticity and nonaromaticity are suggested in metallaborapentalene and metalloxapentalene, respectively.







Abstract
Aromaticity is one of the most basic concepts in organic chemistry. The planar M&#246;bius aromatic metallapentalynes and metallapentalenes have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. However, the aromaticity of metallapentalenes containing heteroatoms (such as B, N, and O), termed as hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes, is rarely studied. Herein, the stability and aromaticity of a series of hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes are theoretically investigated. The results reveal lower aromaticity in metallaborapentalene, comparable aromaticity in metallazapentalene, and nonaromaticity in metalloxapentalene relative to that of metallapentalene. Moreover, the effect of Lewis bases on the aromaticity and stability of metallaborapentalene is discussed. These results provide useful information for experimental chemists to realize more hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes.

      <title>Functionalised N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Bimetallic Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic carbene complexes: This minireview covers the use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands in the formation of bimetallic architectures. NHCs are shown to bind one metal through the conventional C2 position and coordinate to another through donor atoms tethered to the NHC, through the N atom itself or through the NHC backbone. These bimetallic species are potentially useful models for decomposition reactions in homogeneous catalysis and organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become immensely successful ligands in coordination chemistry and homogeneous catalysis due to their strong terminal &#963;&#8208;donor properties. However, by targeting NHC ligands with additional functionalisation, a new area of NHC coordination chemistry has developed that has enabled NHCs to be used to build up bimetallic and multimetallic architectures. This minireview covers the development of functionalised NHC ligands that incorporate additional donor sites in order to coordinate two or more metal atoms. This can be through the N&#8208;atom of the NHC ring, through a donor group attached to the N&#8208;atom or the carbon backbone, coordination of the &#960;&#8208;bond or an annulated &#960;&#8208;donor on the backbone, or through direct metalation of the backbone.

      <title>Strategies for the Controlled Covalent Double Functionalization of Graphene Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Twice is better than once: A double and mild functionalization strategy of graphene oxide is reported based on the combination of a nucleophilic epoxide opening and hydroxyl derivatization by esterification or Williamson reaction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile platform with unique properties that have found broad applications in the biomedical field. Double functionalization is a key aspect in the design of multifunctional GO with combined imaging, targeting, and therapeutic properties. Compared to noncovalent functionalization, covalent strategies lead to GO conjugates with a higher stability in biological fluids. However, only a few double covalent functionalization approaches have been developed so far. The complexity of GO makes the derivatization of the oxygenated groups difficult to control. The combination of a nucleophilic epoxide ring opening with the derivatization of the hydroxyl groups through esterification or Williamson reaction was investigated. The conditions were selective and mild, thus preserving the structure of GO. Our strategy of double functionalization holds great potential for different applications in which the derivatization of GO with different molecules is needed, especially in the biomedical field.

      <title>A Reusable CNT&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of C&#8722;N Bonds
</title>
      <dc:description>
A superior commoner! A reusable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs, prepared from iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been used for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. The catalytic performance superior to those of noble&#8208;metal catalysts such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. This outstanding performance originates from the introduction of Fe&#8208;Nx into the CNTs and the resulting electronic coupling between the iron species and the CNTs.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation is regarded as a very useful and fundamental reaction for the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Noble&#8208;metal and homogeneous catalysts have frequently been used for C&#8722;N bond formation, however, these catalysts have a number of disadvantages, such as high cost, toxicity, and low atom economy. In this work, a low&#8208;toxic and cheap iron complex (iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) has been loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to prepare a heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) named Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs. We employed this SAC in the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds for the first time. It was found that Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs is an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds starting from aromatic amines and ketones. Its catalytic performance was excellent, giving yields of up to 96&#8201;%, six&#8208;fold higher than the yields obtained with noble&#8208;metal catalysts, such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. The catalyst showed efficacy in the reactions of thirteen aromatic amine substrates, without the need for additives, and seventeen enaminones were obtained. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iron species were well dispersed in the Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst as single atoms and that Fe&#8208;Nx might be the catalytic active species. This Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst has potential industrial applications as it could be cycled seven times without any significant loss of activity.

In this work, a low&#8208;toxic and cheap iron complex (iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) has been loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to prepare a heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) named Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs. We employed this SAC in the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds for the first time. It was found that Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs is an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds starting from aromatic amines and ketones. Its catalytic performance was excellent, giving yields of up to 96&#8201;%, six&#8208;fold higher than the yields obtained with noble&#8208;metal catalysts, such as AuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs and RhCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs. The catalyst showed efficacy in the reactions of thirteen aromatic amine substrates, without the need for additives, and seventeen enaminones were obtained. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iron species were well dispersed in the Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs catalyst as single atoms and that Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; might be the catalytic active species. This Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs catalyst has potential industrial applications as it could be cycled seven times without any significant loss of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Regiodivergent Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Mupirocin Methyl Ester</title>
      <dc:description>
endo vs. exo: Chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are used for achieving regiocontrol over the endo vs. exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin methyl ester. This approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. The mechanism of these reactions is investigated by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions.







Abstract
This article presents a new strategy for achieving regiocontrol over the endo versus exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing alcohols, which leads to the formation of five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered cyclic ethers. Unlike traditional methods relying on achiral reagents or enzymes, this approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. By using methyl ester of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin as the substrate, it is demonstrated that catalytic chiral phosphoric acids (R)&#8208;TCYP and (S)&#8208;TIPSY could be used to achieve the selective formation of either the six&#8208;membered endo product (95:5 r.r.) or the five&#8208;membered exo product (77:23 r.r.), correspondingly. This cyclization was found to be unselective under the standard conditions involving various achiral acids, bases, or buffers. The subsequent mechanistic studies using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions provided the description of the potential energy surface, which is fully consistent with the experimental observations. Based on these results, highly detailed reaction paths are obtained and a concerted and highly synchronous mechanism is proposed for the formation of both exo and endo products.

      <title>Engineering of Laccase CueO for Improved Electron Transfer in Bioelectrocatalysis by Semi&#8208;Rational Design</title>
      <dc:description>
As a promising cathodic biocatalyst in enzymatic biofuel cells, laccase CueO catalyzes oxygen reduction efficiently thanks to the supplemental Cu binding. Substituting at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu binding site was shown to enable the manipulation of electrocatalytic current, which is more remarkable than substitution at the conventional Cu active sites.







Abstract
Copper efflux oxidase (CueO) from Escherichia coli is a special bacterial laccase due to its fifth copper binding site. Herein, it is discovered that the fifth Cu occupancy plays a crucial and favorable role of electron relay in bioelectrocatalytic oxygen reduction. By substituting the residues at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu, 11 beneficial variants are identified with &#8805;2.5&#8208;fold increased currents at &#8722;250&#8197;mV (up to 6.13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Detailed electrocatalytic characterization suggests the microenvironment of the fifth Cu binding site governs the electrocatalytic current of CueO. Additionally, further electron transfer analysis assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation demonstrates that an increase in localized structural stability and a decrease of distance between the fifth Cu and the T1 Cu are two main factors contributing to the improved kinetics of CueO variants. It may guide a novel way to tailor laccases and perhaps other oxidoreductases for bioelectrocatalytic applications.

      <title>Effect of Axial Ligands on Easy&#8208;Axis Anisotropy and Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Heptacoordinated FeII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic anisotropy in FeII complexes: Three new heptacoordinated FeII complexes of the general formulae [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The magnitude of the easy&#8208;axis anisotropy of complex 3 is larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to weak d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; interactions between the &#960; orbitals of the metal and the axial donor ligands.







Abstract
A rational approach to modulating easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy by varying the axial donor ligand in heptacoordinated FeII complexes has been explored. In this series of complexes with formulae of [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) [H4L=2,2&#8242;&#8208;{pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylbis(ethan&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)}bis(N&#8208;phenylhydrazinecarboxamide)], the axial positions are successively occupied by different nitrogen&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;donor ligands. Detailed dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal the existence of easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy for all of the complexes, with 1 [Ueff=21&#8197;K, &#964;0=1.72&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] and 2 [Ueff=25&#8197;K, &#964;0=2.25&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] showing field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior. However, both experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate the magnitude of the D value of complex 3 to be larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to the axial bond angle being smaller than that for an ideal geometry. Detailed analysis of the field and temperature dependences of relaxation time for 1 and 2 has revealed that multiple relaxation processes (quantum tunneling of magnetization, direct, and Raman) are involved in slow magnetic relaxation for both of these complexes. Magnetic dilution experiments support the role of intermolecular short contacts.

      <title>Combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy Using Polyfunctionalised Nanoparticles Bearing Robust Gadolinium Surface Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhancing contrast: The straightforward synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles combines the robust attachment of gadolinium units for enhanced MRI contrast with photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
A robust dithiocarbamate tether allows novel gadolinium units based on DOTAGA (q=1) to be attached to the surface of gold nanoparticles (2.6&#8211;4.1&#8197;nm diameter) along with functional units offering biocompatibility, targeting and photodynamic therapy. A dramatic increase in relaxivity (r1) per Gd unit from 5.01&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in unbound form to 31.68&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (10&#8197;MHz, 37&#8201;&#176;C) is observed when immobilised on the surface due to restricted rotation and enhanced rigidity of the Gd complex on the nanoparticle surface. The single&#8208;step synthetic route provides a straightforward and versatile way of preparing multifunctional gold nanoparticles, including examples with conjugated zinc&#8211;tetraphenylporphyrin photosensitizers. The lack of toxicity of these materials (MTT assays) is transformed on irradiation of HeLa cells for 30&#8197;minutes (PDT), leading to 75&#8201;% cell death. In addition to passive targeting, the inclusion of units capable of actively targeting overexpressed folate receptors illustrates the potential of these assemblies as targeted theranostic agents.

&lt;p&gt;A robust dithiocarbamate tether allows novel gadolinium units based on DOTAGA (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;=1) to be attached to the surface of gold nanoparticles (2.6&#8211;4.1&#8197;nm diameter) along with functional units offering biocompatibility, targeting and photodynamic therapy. A dramatic increase in relaxivity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) per Gd unit from 5.01&#8197;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in unbound form to 31.68&#8197;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&#8197;MHz, 37&#8201;&#176;C) is observed when immobilised on the surface due to restricted rotation and enhanced rigidity of the Gd complex on the nanoparticle surface. The single&#8208;step synthetic route provides a straightforward and versatile way of preparing multifunctional gold nanoparticles, including examples with conjugated zinc&#8211;tetraphenylporphyrin photosensitizers. The lack of toxicity of these materials (MTT assays) is transformed on irradiation of HeLa cells for 30&#8197;minutes (PDT), leading to 75&#8201;% cell death. In addition to passive targeting, the inclusion of units capable of actively targeting overexpressed folate receptors illustrates the potential of these assemblies as targeted theranostic agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reassessment of an Innovative Insulin Analogue Excludes Protracted Action yet Highlights the Distinction between External and Internal Diselenide Bridges</title>
      <dc:description>
A seleno&#8208;analogue of bovine insulin, Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB], in which the external interchain disulfide bond A7&#8722;B7 was replaced by diselenide, preserves biological activity but does not augment stability, protect from proteolysis or confer protracted action.







Abstract
Long&#8208;acting insulin analogues represent the most prescribed class of therapeutic proteins. An innovative design strategy was recently proposed: diselenide substitution of an external disulfide bridge. This approach exploited the distinctive physicochemical properties of selenocysteine (U). Relative to wild type (WT), Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB] was reported to be protected from proteolysis by insulin&#8208;degrading enzyme (IDE), predicting prolonged activity. Because of this strategy's novelty and potential clinical importance, we sought to validate these findings and test their therapeutic utility in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. Surprisingly, the analogue did not exhibit enhanced stability, and its susceptibility to cleavage by either IDE or a canonical serine protease (glutamyl endopeptidase Glu&#8208;C) was similar to WT. Moreover, the analogue's pharmacodynamic profile in rats was not prolonged relative to a rapid&#8208;acting clinical analogue (insulin lispro). Although [C7UA, C7UB] does not confer protracted action, nonetheless its comparison to internal diselenide bridges promises to provide broad biophysical insight.

      <title>Exploring Opportunities for Platinum Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Porous Liquids as Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous liquids for catalysts: Platinum nanoparticles encapsulated within a Type&#8197;I porous liquid are successfully employed for the first time as hydrogenation catalysts. In addition, this work explores the effect of each component of the corona&#8208;canopy on the catalytic activity.







Abstract
The unusual combination of characteristics observed for porous liquids, which are typically associated with either porous solids or liquids, has led to considerable interest in this new class of materials. However, these porous liquids have so far only been investigated for their ability to separate and store gases. Herein, the catalytic capability of Pt nanoparticles encapsulated within a Type&#8197;I porous liquid (Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2 PL) is explored for the hydrogenation of several alkenes and nitroarenes under mild conditions (T=40&#8201;&#176;C, PH2=1&#8197;atm). The different intermediates in the porous liquid synthesis (i.e., the initial Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2, the organosilane&#8208;functionalized intermediate, and the final porous liquid) are employed as catalysts in order to understand the effect of each component of the porous liquid on the catalysis. For the hydrogenation of 1&#8208;decene, the Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2 PL catalyst in ethanol has the fastest reaction rate if normalized with respect to the concentration of Pt. The reaction rate slows if the reaction is completed in a &#8220;neat&#8221; porous liquid system, probably because of the high viscosity of the system. These systems may find application in cascade reactions, in particular, for those with mutually incompatible catalysts.

      <title>Untapped Opportunities of Resin&#8208;to&#8208;Resin Transfer Reactions (RRTR) for the Convergent Assembly of Multivalent Peptide Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>
Resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions provide a strategic shortcut to convergent peptide assembly, and offer practical advantages with respect to the associated handling issues. Nonetheless, these assets have remained untapped so far and, in this work, this methodology was successfully adopted for the construction of a peptidosteroid adduct. Readily obtained by a fully solid&#8208;phase&#8208;based procedure, our model confirms the synthetic utility and renews the relevance of RRTR to bioconjugate designs.







Abstract
Handling of the individual fragments remains a bottleneck in the convergent assembly of peptides. Overlooked since the emergence of ligation chemistries during the past two decades, so&#8208;called resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions (RRTR) are here reported as a strategic shortcut in this context. Condensation of the involved moieties at an acceptor resin is facilitated by shuttling peptide segments directly from a donor resin in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The straightforward synthesis of a sterically constrained 13&#8208;mer peptidosteroid model illustrates the utility of this approach. The first successful application of the RRTR methodology in the field of multivalent design and bioconjugation is here reported. Relying on established procedures to generate, monitor and isolate intermediates and products, the solid&#8208;phase nature of our entire strategy allows for the fast construction of polypeptide adducts and libraries thereof. As such, a rejuvenated use and new opportunities for RRTR is reported.

Abstract
Facile redox&#8208;induced aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic interconversions were accomplished by using &#946;&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;21,23&#8208;dithiaporphyrin (CN4S2Por). Introduced cyano groups not only increased the reduction potential of the porphyrin core but also stabilized the antiaromatic isophlorin (CN4S2Iph) by &#960; conjugation. The reduction of CN4S2Por with hydrazine in polar solvents quantitatively affords CN4S2Iph, even under ambient conditions. CN4S2Iph retains a nearly planar conformation and exhibits considerable antiaromaticity. Aerobic oxidation of CN4S2Iph to CN4S2Por occurs in nonpolar solvents. This study was conducted to contribute to the understanding of the structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationship.

      <title>Insights into the Control of Optoelectronic Properties in Mixed&#8208;Stacking Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;stacking cocrystals: A series of mixed&#8208;stacking cocrystals (TMFA, TMCA, and TMTQ) were synthesized to systematically investigate the regulatory effects of their different acceptors (A) on the co&#8208;assembly behaviors, energy&#8208;level structures, and thus optoelectronic characteristics, such as dominant hole or electron transport and on/off switching of the photoresponse. Owing to the excellent photoresponse of TMCA, TMCA&#8208;based phototransistors were studied in depth.







Abstract
Although cocrystallization has provided a promising platform to develop new organic optoelectronic materials, it is still a big challenge to purposely design and achieve specific optoelectronic properties. Herein, a series of mixed&#8208;stacking cocrystals (TMFA, TMCA, and TMTQ) were designed and synthesized, and the regulatory effects of the acceptors on the co&#8208;assembly behavior, charge&#8208;transfer nature, energy&#8208;level structures, and optoelectronic characteristics were systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve effective charge&#8208;transport tuning and photoresponse switching by carefully regulating the intermolecular charge transfer and energy orbitals. The inherent mechanisms underlying the change in these optoelectronic behaviors were analyzed in depth and elucidated to provide clear guidelines for future development of new optoelectronic materials. In addition, due to the excellent photoresponsive characteristics of TMCA, TMCA&#8208;based phototransistors were investigated with varying light wavelength and optical power, and TMCA shows the best performance among all reported cocrystals under UV illumination.

In addition, due to the excellent photoresponsive characteristics of TMCA, TMCA&#8208;based phototransistors were investigated with varying light wavelength and optical power, and TMCA shows the best performance among all reported cocrystals under UV illumination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chemiluminescent Carbapenem&#8208;Based Molecular Probe for Detection of Carbapenemase Activity in Live Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective sensing: The design, synthesis, and activity of the first carbapenemase&#8208;sensitive chemiluminescent probe CPCL are described. The ability of the probe to detect a number of clinically relevant carbapenemases, as well as live bacteria with carbapenemase genes (CPO), is successfully demonstrated (see scheme).







Abstract
Carbapenemase&#8208;producing organisms (CPOs) pose a severe threat to antibacterial treatment due to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. This resistance can be largely attributed to the antibiotic&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes that the bacteria produce. Current carbapenem &#8220;wonder drugs&#8221;, such as doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem, and so on, are resistant to regular &#946;&#8208;lactamases, but susceptible to carbapenemases. Even worse, extended exposure of bacteria to these drugs accelerates the spread of resistance genes. In order to preserve the clinical efficacy of antibacterial treatment, carbapenem drugs should be carefully regulated and deployed only in cases of a CPO infection. Early diagnosis is therefore of paramount importance. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and activity of the first carbapenemase&#8208;sensitive chemiluminescent probe, CPCL, which may be used to monitor CPO activity. The design of our probe enables enzymatic cleavage of the carbapenem core, which is followed by a facile 1,8&#8208;elimination process and the emission of green light through rapid chemical excitation. We have demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect a number of clinically relevant carbapenemases and the successful identification of CPO present in bacterial cultures, such as those used for clinical diagnosis. We believe that our use of &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; chemiluminescence activation will find significant application in future diagnostic assays and improve antibacterial treatment.

      <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing in the Tr&#246;ger's Base Derived From 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Application as a Potent Photodynamic Therapy Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>
Tr&#246;ger's base as photosensitizer: Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) was discovered in naphthalimide&#8208;derived Tr&#246;ger's base NI&#8208;TB, which provides a novel molecular structural motif for attaining efficient spin&#8211;orbital charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The fully rigid, orthogonal structure is beneficial for efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC. The ISC mechanism was confirmed by time&#8208;resolved (TR) EPR spectroscopy. NI&#8208;TB is a potent photodynamic therapy reagent towards HeLa cells (EC50=5.0&#8197;nm)







Abstract
Intersystem crossing (ISC) was observed for naphthalimide (NI)&#8208;derived Tr&#246;ger's base, and the ISC was confirmed to occur by a spin&#8208;orbital charge&#8208;transfer (SOCT) mechanism. Conventional electron donor/acceptor dyads showing SOCT&#8208;ISC have semirigid linkers. In contrast, the linker between the two chromophores in Tr&#246;ger's base is rigid and torsion is completely inhibited, which is beneficial for efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra demonstrated charge&#8208;separation and charge&#8208;recombination&#8208;induced ISC processes. Nanosecond TA spectroscopy confirmed the ISC, and the triplet state is long&#8208;lived (46&#8197;&#956;s, room temperature). The ISC quantum yield is dependent on solvent polarity (8&#8211;41&#8201;%). The triplet state was studied by pulsed&#8208;laser&#8208;excited time&#8208;resolved EPR spectroscopy, and both the NI&#8208;localized triplet state and triplet charge&#8208;transfer state were observed, which is in good agreement with the spin&#8208;density analysis. The Tr&#246;ger's base was confirmed to be a potent photodynamic therapy reagent with HeLa cells (EC50=5.0&#8197;nm).

      <title>Tandem Acid/Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Rearrangement of Glycol Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Easy to handle: Glycol derivatives are rearranged under the catalysis of sulfonic acids and subsequently reduced by a unique Pd/diphosphine (dtbpx=&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene) catalyst system with formic acid as transfer reductant. A [1,2] hydrogen shift leading to the subsequent formation of an aldehyde was identified as key step of the transformation, and a PdII&#8211;hydride complex is assumed as active hydrogenation catalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the acid/Pd&#8208;tandem&#8208;catalyzed transformation of glycol derivatives into terminal formic esters. Mechanistic investigations show that the substrate undergoes rearrangement to an aldehyde under [1,2] hydrogen migration and cleavage of an oxygen&#8208;based leaving group. The leaving group is trapped as its formic ester, and the aldehyde is reduced and subsequently esterified to a formate. Whereas the rearrangement to the aldehyde is catalyzed by sulfonic acids, the reduction step requires a unique catalyst system comprising a PdII or Pd0 precursor in loadings as low as 0.75&#8197;mol&#8201;% and &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene as ligand. The reduction step makes use of formic acid as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reductant. The substrate scope of the transformation encompasses both aromatic and aliphatic substrates and a variety of leaving groups.

      <title>Multi&#8208;Spectroscopic Interrogation of the Spatial Linker Distribution in Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystals: The [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] Showcase
</title>
      <dc:description>
Questioning the Suspects! Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy has revealed that defective 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC) linkers are located only in some crystals of [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] (BTC=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate) after co&#8208;crystallization into defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy in combination with other bulk techniques has shed light on the effects of this dispersion on the material (e.g., on metal oxidation state, the formation of mesopores or the crystal size).







Abstract
In the past few years, defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (DEMOFs) have been studied due to the plethora of textural, catalytic, or magnetic properties that can be enhanced by carefully introducing defect sites into the crystal lattices of MOFs. In this work, the spatial distribution of two different non&#8208;defective and defective linkers, namely 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) and 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC), respectively, has been studied in different DEMOF crystals of the HKUST&#8208;1 topology. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy revealed a nonhomogeneous distribution of defect sites within the [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] crystals, with the CYDC linker incorporated into defect&#8208;rich or defect&#8208;free areas of selected crystals. Additionally, advanced bulk techniques have shed light on the nature of the copper species, which is highly dynamic and directly affects the reactivity of the copper sites, as shown by probe molecule FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed the effect of co&#8208;crystallizing CYDC and BTC on the crystal size and the formation of mesopores, further corroborated by X&#8208;ray scattering analysis. In this way we have demonstrated the necessity of utilizing micro&#8208;spectroscopy along with a whole array of bulk spectroscopic techniques to fully describe multicomponent metal&#8211;organic frameworks.

      <title>Epitaxial Cubic Silicon Carbide Photocathodes for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Thin films: For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level.







Abstract
Cubic silicon carbide (3C&#8208;SiC) material feature a suitable bandgap and high resistance to photocorrosion. Thus, it has been emerged as a promising semiconductor for hydrogen evolution. Here, the relationship between the photoelectrochemical properties and the microstructures of different SiC materials is demonstrated. For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as the photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level. This finding offers a strategy to design SiC&#8208;based photocathodes with superior photoelectrochemical performances.

      <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Dynamics of Struvite Crystallization: Insights from the Macroscopic to Molecular Scale</title>
      <dc:description>
Going with the flow: A microfluidics platform for assessing crystal growth under flow conditions is used to characterize struvite crystallization over a range of synthesis conditions. A combination of in situ microfluidic assays and atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that struvite predominantly grows by a classical pathway involving layered surface growth through the addition of solute ions/molecules (see figure; the image of the encrusted catheter has been reprinted by permission from Springer Nature and Elsevier).







Abstract
The crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (struvite) often occurs under conditions of fluid flow, yet the dynamics of struvite growth under these relevant environments has not been previously reported. In this study, we use a microfluidic device to evaluate the anisotropic growth of struvite crystals at variable flow rates and solution supersaturation. We show that bulk crystallization under quiescent conditions yields irreproducible data owing to the propensity of struvite to adopt defects in its crystal lattice, as well as fluctuations in pH that markedly impact crystal growth rates. Studies in microfluidic channels allow for time&#8208;resolved analysis of seeded growth along all three principle crystallographic directions and under highly controlled environments. After having first identified flow rates that differentiate diffusion and reaction limited growth regimes, we operated solely in the latter regime to extract the kinetic rates of struvite growth along the [100], [010], and [001] directions. In situ atomic force microscopy was used to obtain molecular level details of surface growth mechanisms. Our findings reveal a classical pathway of crystallization by monomer addition with the expected transition from growth by screw dislocations at low supersaturation to that of two&#8208;dimensional layer generation and spreading at high supersaturation. Collectively, these studies present a platform for assessing struvite crystallization under flow conditions and demonstrate how this approach is superior to measurements under quiescent conditions.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Nanoswitches: Solvent&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement of Copper Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Multicolor fluorescence emission: Copper nanocluster (CuNC) assemblies with multicolor fluorescence emission and excellent reversibility were constructed on the basis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission and the solvent effect of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;capped CuNCs. On the basis of these stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent nanoswitches, a fluorescence sensing platform for the identification of organic solvents was designed.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) as a new class of fluorescent materials have attracted a great deal of interest due to their outstanding fluorescence properties. In this work, a variety of organic solvents were used to induce self&#8208;assembly of glutathione&#8208;capped CuNCs (GSH&#8208;CuNCs) to form ordered assemblies with enhanced fluorescence properties. Assemblies with multicolor fluorescence emission were constructed on the basis of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of GSH&#8208;CuNCs and the solvent effect. The fluorescence emission from these GSH&#8208;CuNCs assemblies can also be tuned from yellow to purple by changing the organic solvent. A possible mechanism based on the size of the assemblies and electron transfer was explored to explain the solvent effects on GSH&#8208;CuNCs. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoswitches with excellent reversibility can be controlled by changing the type of organic solvent and the ratio of the organic solvent to the aqueous solution of GSH&#8208;CuNCs. As the CuNCs assemblies exhibit strong, stable, and color&#8208;tunable fluorescence, they were employed as color&#8208;conversion materials for recognizing different organic solvents.

Abstract
This work reports gold&#8208;catalyzed iminations of terminal propargyl alcohols with anthranils or isoxazoles to yield E&#8208;configured &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#8208;1&#8208;als with complete chemoselectivity. These catalytic iminations occur exclusively with C(1)&#8208;nucleophilic additions on terminal alkynes, in contrast to a typical C(2)&#8208;route. For 3,3&#8208;dialkylprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols, a methyl substituent is superior to long alkyl chains as the 1,2&#8208;migration groups toward &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes. For secondary prop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols, phenyl, vinyl, and cyclopropyl substituents are better than hydrogen as the migrating groups, obviating typical gold carbene reactions. DFT calculations have been performed to rationalize the observed C(1)&#8208;regioselectivity and the preferable cyclopropyl migration based on gold carbene pathways.

      <title>Dithienopyrrole Derivatives with Nitronyl Nitroxide Radicals and Their Oxidation to Cationic High&#8208;Spin Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Dithienopyrrole derivatives with phenyl and methylthiothiophenyl connected with phenylnitronylnitroxides were oxidized to their cations forming high spin S=1 molecules.







Abstract
Three 1 N&#8208;phenyl nitronyl nitroxide (NN) 4&#8208;substituted dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) derivatives with R1=4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;, 4H&#8208;, and 4&#8208;methylthiothiophenyl&#8208; (R12DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN, R1=H, Ph and MeSTh) were designed, synthesized and characterized. The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the molecules exhibited two main oxidation peaks, first for radical cation and next for dication formation. The cation and dication formation were also confirmed by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy for Ph2DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN and MeSTh2DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN titrated with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)aminiumhexachloroantimonate (magic blue). In addition, the cation and dication formation were verified by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, the exchange interactions (J/kB) of NN and radical cation were calculated by DFT studies.

The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the molecules exhibited two main oxidation peaks, first for radical cation and next for dication formation. The cation and dication formation were also confirmed by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy for &lt;b&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MeSTh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN&lt;/b&gt; titrated with &lt;i&gt;tris&lt;/i&gt;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)aminiumhexachloroantimonate (magic blue). In addition, the cation and dication formation were verified by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, the exchange interactions (&lt;i&gt;J/k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) of NN and radical cation were calculated by DFT studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overcoming Crystallinity Limitations of Aluminium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by Oxalic Acid Modulated Synthesis
</title>
      <dc:description>
The chelation of aluminium ions by oxalic acid enables a versatile modulation action, drastically increasing crystal size without undesired framework modifications.







Abstract
A modulated synthesis approach based on the chelating properties of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) is presented as a robust and versatile method to achieve highly crystalline Al&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. A comparative study on this method and the already established modulation by hydrofluoric acid was conducted using MIL&#8208;53 as test system. The superior performance of oxalic acid modulation in terms of crystallinity and absence of undesired impurities is explained by assessing the coordination modes of the two modulators and the structural features of the product. The validity of our approach was confirmed for a diverse set of Al&#8208;MOFs, namely X&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 (X=OH, CH3O, Br, NO2), CAU&#8208;10, MIL&#8208;69, and Al(OH)ndc (ndc=1,4&#8208;naphtalenedicarboxylate), highlighting the potential benefits of extending the use of this modulator to other coordination materials.

Abstract
The thermodynamics of halogen bonding of a series of isostructural Group&#8197;10 metal pincer fluoride complexes of the type [(3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu)MF] (3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu=&#954;3&#8208;C6HR2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OPtBu2)2 with R=H, tBu, COOMe; M=Ni, Pd, Pt) and iodopentafluorobenzene was investigated. Based on NMR experiments at different temperatures, all complexes&#8197;1&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Ni), 2&#8208;H (R=H, M=Pd), 2&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pd), 2&#8208;COOMe (R=COOMe, M=Pd) and 3&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pt) form strong halogen bonds with Pd complexes showing significantly stronger binding to iodopentafluorobenzene. Structural and computational analysis of a model adduct of complex&#8197;2&#8208;tBu with 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene as well as of structures of iodopentafluorobenzene in toluene solution shows that formation of a type&#8197;I contact occurs.

      <title>Barium&#8208;Catalysed Dehydrocoupling of Hydrosilanes and Borinic Acids: A Mechanistic Insight</title>
      <dc:description>
When barium and boron meet: The mechanism of the barium&#8208;mediated dehydrocoupling of borinic acids and hydrosilanes, yielding borasiloxanes in a controlled fashion, has been established by combined experimental and computational investigations.







Abstract
Two very rare cases of barium boryloxides, the homoleptic [Ba(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)2&#8901;C7H8] and the heteroleptic [{LONO4}BaOB{CH(SiMe3)2}2] stabilised by the multidentate aminoetherphenolate {LONO4}&#8722;, are presented, and their structural properties are discussed. The electron&#8208;deficient [Ba(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)2&#8901;C7H8] shows, in particular, resilient &#951;6&#8208;coordination of the toluene molecule. Together with its amido parents [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2&#8901;thf2] and [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2]2, this complex catalyses the fast and chemoselective dehydrocoupling of borinic acids R2BOH and hydrosilanes HSiR&#8242;3, yielding borasiloxanes R2BOSiR&#8242;3 in a controlled fashion. The assessment of substrate scope indicates that, for now, the reaction is limited to bulky borinic acids. Kinetic analysis shows that the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic manifold traverses a dinuclear transition state. A detailed mechanistic scenario is proposed on the basis of DFT computations, the results of which are fully consistent with experimental data. It consists of a stepwise process with rate&#8208;determining nucleophilic attack of a metal&#8208;bound O&#8208;atom onto the incoming hydrosilane, involving throughout dinuclear catalytically active species.

Abstract
The synthesis of a new triaminoguanidinium&#8208;based ligand with three tris&#8208;chelating [NNO]&#8208;binding pockets and C3 symmetry is described. The reaction of tris&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylene&#8208;N&#8208;oxide)triaminoguanidinium salts with zinc(II) formate leads to the formation of cyclic supramolecular coordination compounds which in solution bind fullerenes in their spherical cavities. The rapid encapsulation of C60 can be observed by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is verified using computation.

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity to Local Dynamics in Peptides by Use of Temperature&#8208;Jump IR Spectroscopy and Isotope Labeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced sensitivity: Site&#8208;selected dynamics of a three&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide are probed by laser&#8208;excited temperature&#8208;jump infrared spectroscopy and isotopic labeling. Relaxation time constants show an enhanced sensitivity to vibrational coupling.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific isotopic labeling of molecules is a widely used approach in IR spectroscopy to resolve local contributions to vibrational modes. The induced frequency shift of the corresponding IR band depends on the substituted masses, as well as on hydrogen bonding and vibrational coupling. The impact of these different factors was analyzed with a designed three&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide and by use of selected 13C isotope substitutions at multiple positions in the peptide backbone. Single&#8208;strand labels give rise to isotopically shifted bands at different frequencies, depending on the specific sites; this demonstrates sensitivity to the local environment. Cross&#8208;strand double&#8208; and triple&#8208;labeled peptides exhibited two resolved bands that could be uniquely assigned to specific residues, the equilibrium IR spectra of which indicated only weak local&#8208;mode coupling. Temperature&#8208;jump IR laser spectroscopy was applied to monitor structural dynamics and revealed an impressive enhancement of the isotope sensitivity to both local positions and coupling between them, relative to that of equilibrium FTIR spectroscopy. Site&#8208;specific relaxation rates were altered upon the introduction of additional cross&#8208;strand isotopes. Likewise, the rates for the global &#946;&#8208;sheet dynamics were affected in a manner dependent on the distinct relaxation behavior of the labeled oscillator. This study reveals that isotope labels provide not only local structural probes, but rather sense the dynamic complexity of the molecular environment.

Glutathione&#8208;capped CuNCs (GSH&#8208;CuNCs) were used in this work to form fluorescent assemblies. This simple approach occurs by introducing organic solvents. Multicolor fluorescence emission assemblies with excellent reversibility were constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission and the solvent effect of GSH&#8208;CuNCs. A possible mechanism, which is based on the size of assemblies and electron transfer, was explored to explain the solvent effects of GSH&#8208;CuNCs. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoswitches with excellent reversibility can be controlled by changing the types of organic solvents and the ratio of organic solvent to GSH&#8208;CuNCs aqueous solution. As the CuNCs assemblies exhibit strong, stable, and color&#8208;tunable fluorescence, they are employed as the color conversion materials for recognizing different organic solvents.

      <dc:description>
Isomeric dithieno[b,f]phosphepines (DTPs) have been synthesized and their electronic and structural properties were investigated by experimental (UV/Vis, CV, X&#8208;ray) and theoretical (DFT) techniques. A significant dependency of the molecular properties on the isomerically different ring fusions was revealed, which could be ascribed to different conjugation pathways within the DTPs. Moreover, a synthetic method for the &#960;&#8208;expansion of DTPs via direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling was found, which renders these compounds promising candidates for the development of novel organophosphorus functional materials.

      <dc:description>
The mechanism of the barium&#8208;catalysed dehydrocoupling between borinic acids R2BOH and hydrosilanes HSiR&#8217;3 that generate borasiloxanes R2BO&#8208;SiR&#8217;3 has been elucidated by teams at ISCR Rennes (France) and KAUST (Saudi Arabia) upon combination of experimental and computational data. The analysis shows that these chemoselective reactions are mediated by dinuclear catalytically active barium&#8208;boryloxide species, regardless of the actual nuclearity of the precatalyst, monomeric as in [Ba(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)2], or dimeric as in [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2]2 and [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2]2.

      <title>Cover Feature: Time&#8208;Resolved Dynamics of Struvite Crystallization: Insights from the Macroscopic to Molecular Scale (Chem. Eur. J. 16/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystallization in flow systems is a common occurrence in pipelines, catheters, and commercial processes. This accumulation of mineral scale, such as struvite, poses a problem. Microfluidic devices are an efficient platform to assess crystallization under flow conditions, in which time&#8208;resolved measurements allow the quantification of anisotropic growth rates at variable conditions. When coupled with techniques, such as in situ atomic force microscopy, it is then possible to elucidate growth mechanisms and validate predictions made on the basis of macroscopic analysis.

      <title>The Structural Basis for Processing of Unnatural Base Pairs by DNA Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding or rather more hydrophobic? Two different pairing concepts are the basis for the currently most promising unnatural base pair (UBP) candidates. This review mainly focusses on structural studies investigating UBP pairings in free duplex DNA or the active site of KlenTaq DNA polymerase, but also highlights the general mechanisms for the acceptance of these unnatural substrates by DNA polymerases.







Abstract
Unnatural base pairs (UBPs) greatly increase the diversity of DNA and RNA, furthering their broad range of molecular biological and biotechnological approaches. Different candidates have been developed whereby alternative hydrogen&#8208;bonding patterns and hydrophobic and packing interactions have turned out to be the most promising base&#8208;pairing concepts to date. The key in many applications is the highly efficient and selective acceptance of artificial base pairs by DNA polymerases, which enables amplification of the modified DNA. In this Review, computational as well as experimental studies that were performed to characterize the pairing behavior of UBPs in free duplex DNA or bound to the active site of KlenTaq DNA polymerase are highlighted. The structural studies, on the one hand, elucidate how base pairs lacking hydrogen bonds are accepted by these enzymes and, on the other hand, highlight the influence of one or several consecutive UBPs on the structure of a DNA double helix. Understanding these concepts facilitates optimization of future UBPs for the manifold fields of applications.

      <title>Molecularly Mixed Composite Membranes: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Microporous molecules have the potential to enable pseudo &#8220;solid solution&#8221; molecularly mixed composite membranes that have improved performance over pure polymer counterparts (see figure).







Abstract
The fabrication of porous molecules, such as metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs), porous organic cages (POCs) and others, has given rise to the potential for creating &#8220;solid solutions&#8221; of molecular fillers and polymers. Such solid solutions circumvent longstanding interface issues associated with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), and are referred to as molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) to distinguish them from traditional two&#8208;phase MMMs. Early investigations of MMCMs highlight the advantages of solid solutions over MMMs, including dispersion of the filler, anti&#8208;plasticization of the polymer network, and removal of deleterious interfacial issues. However, the exact microscopic structure as well as the transport modality in this new class of membrane are not well understood. Moreover, there are clear engineering challenges that need to be addressed for MMCMs to transition into the field. In this Minireview, the authors outline several scientific and technological challenges associated with the aforementioned questions and their suggestions to tackle them.

      <title>Long&#8208;Range Chiral Induction by a Fully Noncovalent Approach in Supramolecular Porphyrin&#8211;Calixarene Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly in water of anionic porphyrins MnTPPS and CuTPPS with cationic bis&#8208;calix[4]arenes BC4 leads to discrete multi&#8208;metalloporphyrin/calixarene assemblies. The chirality of the entire assembly can be easily tuned by adding the chiral calix[4]arene C4 at the periphery of the assembly, thus demonstrating a long&#8208;range chiral transfer process.







Abstract
The hierarchical assembly, in aqueous solution, of a new multi&#8208;metalloporphyrin/calixarene aggregate has been accomplished. In this supramolecular system transfer of chirality, from the outermost components to the central porphyrin reporter, takes place as a result of favorable and fully noncovalent long&#8208;range electronic communication.

Abstract
Heterogeneous copper catalysis enabled photoinduced C&#8722;H arylations under exceedingly mild conditions at room temperature. The versatile hybrid copper catalyst provided step&#8208;economical access to arylated heteroarenes, terpenes and alkaloid natural products with various aryl halides.

      <title>Multilayered 2D Cesium&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite with Strong Polarization Sensitivity: Dimensional Reduction of CsPbBr3</title>
      <dc:description>
Dimensional reduction of CsPbBr3 results in the highly anisotropic internal motif and optical absorption of a newly tailored 2D Cs&#8208;based halide perovskite, which enables excellent linearly polarized photodetection behaviors with remarkable dichroic ratio (Ipc/Ipa&#8776;2.1). This structure (see figure) provides a promising opportunity for exploring new polarized&#8208;sensitive photodetectors.







Abstract
3D perovskite CsPbBr3 has recently taken a blooming position for optoelectronic applications. However, due to the lack of natural anisotropy of optical attributes, it is a great challenge to fulfil polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection. Here, for the first time, we exploited dimensionality reduction of CsPbBr3 to tailor a 2D&#8208;multilayered hybrid perovskite, (TRA)2CsPb2Br7 (1, in which TRA is (carboxy)cyclohexylmethylammonium), serving as a potential polarized&#8208;light detecting candidate. Its unique quantum&#8208;confined 2D structure results in intrinsic anisotropy of electrical conductivity, optical absorbance, and polarization&#8208;dependent responses. Particularly, it exhibits remarkable dichroism with the photocurrent ratio (Ipc/Ipa) of &#8776;2.1, being much higher than that of the isotropic CsPbBr3 crystal and reported CH3NH3PbI3 nanowire (&#8776;1.3), which reveals its great potentials for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection. Further, crystal&#8208;based detectors of 1 show fascinating responses to the polarized light, including high detectivity (&gt;1010 Jones), fast responding time (&#8776;300&#8197;&#956;s), and sizeable on/off current ratios (&gt;104). To our best knowledge, this is the first study on 2D Cs&#8208;based hybrid perovskite exhibiting strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity. The work highlights an effective pathway to explore new polarization sensitive candidates for hybrid perovskites and promotes their future electronic applications.

Here, for the first time, we exploited dimensionality reduction of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to tailor a 2D&#8208;multilayered hybrid perovskite, (TRA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, in which TRA is (carboxy)cyclohexylmethylammonium), serving as a potential polarized&#8208;light detecting candidate. Its unique quantum&#8208;confined 2D structure results in intrinsic anisotropy of electrical conductivity, optical absorbance, and polarization&#8208;dependent responses. Particularly, it exhibits remarkable dichroism with the photocurrent ratio (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;pc&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;pa&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8776;2.1, being much higher than that of the isotropic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal and reported CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowire (&#8776;1.3), which reveals its great potentials for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection. Further, crystal&#8208;based detectors of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; show fascinating responses to the polarized light, including high detectivity (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jones), fast responding time (&#8776;300&#8197;&#956;s), and sizeable on/off current ratios (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). To our best knowledge, this is the first study on 2D Cs&#8208;based hybrid perovskite exhibiting strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity. The work highlights an effective pathway to explore new polarization sensitive candidates for hybrid perovskites and promotes their future electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intrinsic Turn&#8208;On Response of Thioflavin&#8197;T in Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorescence turn&#8208;on responses were found when amyloid&#8208;sensing dye thioflavin T binds to a derivatized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in both gaseous and solvated forms, but several other solution&#8208;active turn&#8208;on reporters did not turn on gas&#8208;phase fluorescence. The contrast sheds light on key interactions between chromophore, host and solvent in an important fluorescent probe.







Abstract
The fluorescence enhancement (&#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;) response of the amyloid&#8208;sensing dye thioflavin&#8197;T (ThT) is examined in vacuo, where solvent interactions are absent. Upon the complexation of ThT with a derivatized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, heptakis&#8208;[6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;6&#8208;(3&#8208;sulfanylpropanoic acid)]&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, turn&#8208;on responses in both the gas phase and solution phase were observed. In contrast, turn&#8208;on response was not detected when ThT was bound to gaseous cucurbit[7]uril or human telomeric DNA 22AG, whereas clear turn&#8208;on response occurs in solution. The observed difference in turn&#8208;on response in the gas phase emphasizes the key interplay between chromophore, host and solvent and demonstrates the utility of gas&#8208;phase spectroscopy to tease out the balance among intermolecular forces driving the behavior of important chromophores in solution.

      <title>Highly Enantioselective, Organocatalytic, and Scalable Synthesis of a Rare cis,cis&#8208;Tricyclic Diterpenoid</title>
      <dc:description>
Organocatalysis: The highly enantioselective synthesis of a tricyclic terpenoid system is described with a remarkable cis,cis&#8208;configuration of the fused decalin and hydrindane systems. This intriguing selectivity is thought to be due to the nitro group dictating the transition state of the cyclization adopted (see scheme).







Abstract
A highly enantioselective, organocatalytic, and scalable synthesis of a very unusual cis&#8208;decalin&#8208;cis&#8208;hydrindane tricyclic diterpenoid system has been achieved. Despite the prevalent pharmacological space that the related trans,trans and trans,cis&#8208;systems occupy, there have been no reports of an asymmetric synthesis of the cis,cis systems in the literature until now. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach not only through access to a diverse range of products, all of which are attained in exceptionally high selectivities, but also by showing their easy conversion to the corresponding trans,cis&#8208;system and other derivatives.

      <title>Rational Design of a Cocktail of Inhibitors against A&#946; Aggregation</title>
      <dc:description>
A cocktail of several inhibitors which could bind with different species of A&#946; aggregates simultaneously and achieve co&#8208;inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, without any unwanted interference observed.







Abstract
It has been reported that many molecules could inhibit the aggregation of A&#946; (amyloid&#8208;&#946;) through suppressing either primary nucleation, secondary nucleation, or elongation processes. In order to suppress multiple pathways of A&#946; aggregation, we screened 23 small molecules and found two types of inhibitors with different inhibiting mechanisms based on chemical kinetics analysis. Trp&#8208;glucose conjugates (AS2) could bind with fibril ends while natural products (D3 and D4) could associate with monomers. A cocktail of these two kinds of molecules achieved co&#8208;inhibition of various fibrillar species and avoid unwanted interference.

Abstract
While artificial cyclases hold great promise in chemical synthesis, this work presents the first example of a DNA&#8208;catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDHDA) between dihydrofuran and various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl imidazoles.

Most importantly, these results show that the concept of DNA&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis can be expanded to new synthetic transformations offering an efficient, sustainable, and highly selective tool for the construction of chiral building blocks.

      <title>Bifunctional RNA&#8208;Targeting Deoxyribozyme Nanodevice as a Potential Theranostic Agent</title>
      <dc:description>
Two birds with one stone: A DNA association can complete both RNA&#8208;cleaving (therapeutic) and RNA&#8208;detecting (diagnostic) functions.







Abstract
Theranostic approaches rely on simultaneous diagnostic of a disease and its therapy. Here, we designed a DNA nanodevice, which can simultaneously report the presence of a specific RNA target through an increase in fluorescence and cleave it. High selectivity of RNA target recognition under near physiological conditions was achieved. The proposed approach can become a basis for the design of DNA nanomachines and robots for diagnostics and therapy of viral infections, cancer, and genetic disorders.

      <title>Hantzsch Ester as a Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalyst for Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of Arylhalides and Arylsulfinates</title>
      <dc:description>
Hantzsch ester as a photocatalyst: Diethyl 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (HEH) has been utilized as a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst for the coupling of arylsulfinates and arylhalides without transition metal, external oxidant, sacrificial agent, and mediator.







Abstract
Diethyl 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (HEH) has been utilized as a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst for the cross coupling of arylhalides and arylsulfinates without transition metal, sacrificial agent, and mediator. This method is compatible with various functional groups and provides diaryl sulfones in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction undergoes the stepwise light irradiation of HE&#8722;, single electron transfer (SET) in donor&#8211;acceptor complex (DAC) from *HE&#8722; to arylhalide, trapping of aryl radical with sulfinate, and SET oxidation of sulfone radical anion by HE. to sulfone by the DAC method.

      <title>Isomeric Dithienophosphepines: The Impact of Ring Fusion on Electronic and Structural Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Similar yet different: A series of isomeric thiophene&#8208;fused phosphepines has been synthesized and the impact of different ring fusions on structural, photophysical, and redox properties in parent as well as &#960;&#8208;expanded derivatives has been studied.







Abstract
The synthesis and extensive experimental (X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry) and theoretical (DFT calculations) characterization of two isomeric dithieno[b,f]phosphepines (DTPs) are presented herein. The relative orientation of the phosphepine and the thiophene moieties has a decisive impact on the electronic and structural properties of these compounds. Moreover, the thiophene units allow for a facile subsequent functionalization through direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling, which renders DTPs highly promising building blocks for organophosphorus functional materials.

      <dc:description>
Promising electrocatalysts: Phosphorene, ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) with monolayered or few&#8208;layered structure, has emerged as a promising member of the family of 2D materials. As a single&#8208;elemental material, phosphorene has shown its potential as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and other electrocatalytic applications. Its great potential in this emerging field needs to be further explored.







Abstract
Phosphorene, generally defined as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) with monolayered or few&#8208;layered structure, has emerged as a promising member of the family of 2D materials. Since its discovery in 2014, extensive research has been focused on broadening its applications, covering the biological, photoelectric, and electrochemical fields, owing to the unique physicochemical and structural properties. As a single&#8208;elemental material, phosphorene has demonstrated its applicability for the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and other electrocatalytic applications. In this Minireview, a summary of the very recent research progresses of phosphorene in electrocatalysis is offered, with a special focus on the effective synthetic strategies towards performance improvement. In the concluding section, challenges and perspectives are also discussed.

Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used in the biomedical field. 18F&#8208;TCO/Tetrazine ligation is the most reactive radiolabelled inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but its application had been limited due to modest contrast ratios of the resulting conjugates. Herein, we describe the use of hydrophilic tetrazines to improve tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background contrast of neurotensin receptor targeted PET agents. PET agents were constructed using a rapid Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the radiolabeled trans&#8208;cyclooctene (18F&#8208;sTCO) with neurotensin (NT) conjugates of a 3,6&#8208;diaryltetrazine, 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;aryltetrazine, and a derivative of 3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)tetrazine. Although cell binding assays demonstrated all agents have comparable binding affinity, the conjugate derived from 3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)tetrazine demonstrated the highest tumor to muscle contrast, followed by conjugates of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;aryltetrazine and 3,6&#8208;diaryltetrazine.

      <title>Electride&#8208;Sponsored Radical&#8208;Controlled CO2 Reduction to Organic Acids: A Computational Design</title>
      <dc:description>Converting CO  2  to high value chemicals has been regarded as an important solution for a sustainable low&#8208;carbon economy. Here, we theoretically designed an innovative strategy for the absorption and activation of CO  2  by the electride N3Li which is 1,3,5(2,6)&#8208;tripyridinacyclohexaphane (N3) intercalated by lithium. Density functional theory (DFT) computations show that the interaction of CO  2  to N3Li leads to the catalytic complex N3Li(&#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) which can initiate the radical&#8208;controlled reduction of another CO  2  to form organic acids through radical reactions in gas phase. The CO  2  reduction consists of four steps, including (1) the formation of N3Li(&#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) through the combination of N3Li with CO  2  ; (2) the hydrogen abstraction from RH (R=H, CH  3  and C  2  H  5  ) by N3Li(&#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) to form the radical R  &#8226;  and N3Li(&#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C)H; (3) the combination of CO  2  with the radical R  &#8226;  to form RCOO  &#8226;  ; and (4) intermolecular hydrogen transfer from the intermediate N3Li(&#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C)H to RCOO  &#8226;  . In the whole reaction process, the CO  2  moiety in the complex N3Li(&#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) maintains certain radical character at the carbon atom of CO  2  and plays a self&#8208;catalyzing role. This work represents the first example of electride&#8208;sponsored radical&#8208;controlled CO  2  reduction, and thus provides an alternative strategy in the exploration of the CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeting an interaction between two disordered domains using a designed peptide</title>
      <dc:description>Intrinsically disordered regions in proteins (IDRs) mediate many disease&#8208;related protein&#8208;protein interactions. However, the unfolded character and continuous conformational changes of IDRs make them difficult to target for therapeutic purposes. Here we show that a designed peptide based on the disordered p53 linker domain can be used for targeting a partner IDR from the anti&#8208;apoptotic iASPP protein, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells. The p53 linker forms a hairpin&#8208;like structure with its two termini in close proximity. We designed a peptide derived from the disordered termini without the hairpin, termed p53 LinkTer. The LinkTer peptide bound the disordered RT loop of iASPP with the same affinity as the parent p53 Linker peptide, and inhibited the p53&#8208;iASPP interaction in vitro. The LinkTer peptide showed increased stability to proteolysis, penetrated cancer cells, caused nuclei shrinkage and decreased cells viability. We conclude that a designed peptide comprising only the IDR from a peptide sequence can be an improved inhibitor since it binds its target protein without the need for pre&#8208;folding, paving the way for therapeutic targeting of IDRs.</dc:description>

      <title>Tandem Catalysis of Ammonia Borane Dehydrogenation and Phenylacetylene Hydrogenation Catalyzed by CeO2 Nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
      <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis. A CeO2 nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al) sandwich&#8208;structured catalyst has been used as a tandem catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (see figure). This work provides an alternative strategy for balancing the conversion and selectivity of liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed, selective hydrogenation in the liquid phase is widely used in industry for the synthesis of chemicals. However, it can be a challenge to prevent active nanoparticles (e.g., palladium) from aggregation/leaching and meanwhile achieve high conversion as well as selectivity, especially under mild conditions. To address these issues, a CeO2 nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al) sandwich&#8208;structured catalyst has been prepared in which the MIL&#8208;53(Al) porous shell can efficiently stabilize the palladium nanoparticles. When this catalyst was used in a tandem catalytic reaction involving the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, remarkably, the hydrogen released from the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane boosted the catalytic process, with 100&#8201;% conversion of phenylacetylene and a selectivity of 96.2&#8201;% for styrene, even at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, within 1&#8197;min. This work therefore provides an alternative strategy for balancing the conversion and selectivity of liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions.

      <title>Ligand Taxonomy for Bioinorganic Modeling of Dioxygen&#8208;Activating Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Designer ligands for biomimetic chemistry: A judicious combination of donor atoms, ligand denticity, and backbone topology dictates the stereochemistry and reactivity of iron complexes to mimic non&#8208;heme enzymes, which reductively activate dioxygen to catalyze oxidative transformations of organic molecules.







Abstract
Novel functions emerge from novel structures. To develop efficient catalytic systems for challenging chemical transformations, chemists often seek inspirations from enzymatic catalysis. A large number of iron complexes supported by nitrogen&#8208;rich multidentate ligands have thus been developed to mimic oxo&#8208;transfer reactivity of dioxygen&#8208;activating metalloenzymes. Such efforts have significantly advanced our understanding of the reaction mechanisms by trapping key intermediates and elucidating their geometric and electronic properties. Critical to the success of this biomimetic approach is the design and synthesis of elaborate ligand systems to balance the thermodynamic stability, structural adaptability, and chemical reactivity. In this Concept article, representative design strategies for biomimetic atom&#8208;transfer chemistry are discussed from the perspectives of &#8220;ligand builders&#8221;. Emphasis is placed on how the primary coordination sphere is constructed, and how it can be elaborated further by rational design for desired functions.

      <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;up Bioorthogonal Probes for In Vivo Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Light it up! A new class of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;based light&#8208;up bioorthogonal probes with tunable colors was developed. In bioimaging experiments, these versatile probes were successfully used for live&#8208;cell imaging without washing steps, as well as in vivo two&#8208;photon (TP) imaging of live zebrafish and mice, in which they showed better resolution and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for in vivo tumor imaging than conventional fluorophores without light&#8208;up property.







Abstract
Light&#8208;up bioorthogonal probes have attracted increasing attention recently due to their capability to directly image diverse biomolecules in living cells without washing steps. The development of bioorthogonal probes with excellent fluorescent properties suitable for in vivo imaging, such as long excitation/emission wavelength, high fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratio, and deep penetration, has been rarely reported. Herein, a series of azide&#8208;based light&#8208;up bioorthogonal probes with tunable colors based on a weak fluorescent 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) scaffold were designed and synthesized. The azido quinoline derivatives are able to induce large fluorescence enhancement (up to 1352&#8208;fold) after click reaction with alkynes. In addition, the probes could be engineered to exhibit excellent two&#8208;photon properties (&#948;=542&#8197;GM at 780&#8197;nm) after further introducing different styryl groups into the AQ scaffold. Subsequent detailed bioimaging experiments demonstrated that these versatile probes can be successfully used for live cell/zebrafish imaging without washing steps. Further in vivo two&#8208;photon imaging experiments demonstrated that these light&#8208;up biorthogonal probe outperformed conventional fluorophores, for example, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and deep tissue penetration. The design strategy reported in this study is a useful approach to realize diverse high&#8208;performance biorthogonal light&#8208;up probes for in vivo studying.

      <title>First principle investigation of &#946;&#8208;FeOOH for hydrogen evolution: Identifying reactive sites and boosting surficial reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Akaganeite (&#946;&#8208;FeOOH) is a widely investigated candidate for photo(electro)catalysis such as water splitting. Nevertheless, the insightful understanding of surficial reaction between water and &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, in particular hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is still insufficient. In this work, we applied a set of first principle calculations on pristine &#946;&#8208;FeOOH and halogen&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, in order to evaluate the HER performance via the computational hydrogen electrode model. Our results show that HER on &#946;&#8208;FeOOH tends to occur at Fe site on (010) surface, and palladium (Pd) and nickel (Ni) are found to serve as excellent co&#8208;catalysts to boost HER process due to the remarkably reduced free energy change of hydrogen adsorption when loaded on the surface of &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, demonstrating great potential for efficient water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>A Synthetic Chlorophyll Dimer Appending Fullerene: Effect of Chlorophyll Pairing on (Photo)redox Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Accurately mimicking structure and function of natural chlorophyll (Chl) assemblies is very challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of a fullerene&#8208;appended Chl dimer being capable of intramolecular photoinduced charge separation (CS) with a unique structure reminiscent of reaction centers (RCs) in phototrophs. Structural analyses revealed that the Chl dimer adopts a bird&#8208;like structure in which two Chl components overlapped partially with one of the four pyrrole rings in a Chl ring similar to in a Chl pair in the natural RC complexes. A comparative study including voltammetry and spectrometric analyses using the Chl dimer and its corresponding monomer with and without a fullerene moiety was performed to gain insight into the effect of Chl pairing on (photo)redox properties. Our results suggest that the present dimer motif that closely resemble the Chl pair in natural RCs lead to more facile oxidation and lower energy of the CS state of the Chl dimer than those of the Chl monomer, resulting in its photoredox behavior different from that of the monomer Chl.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Perturbation of Oncogenic Protein Folding: from the Prediction of Locally Unstable Structures to the Design of Disruptors of Hsp90&#8208;Client Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Protein folding quality control in cells requires the activity of a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones. Heat shock protein&#8208;90 (Hsp90), a multidomain ATP driven molecular machine, is a prime representative of this family of proteins. Interactions between Hsp90, its co&#8208;chaperones, and client proteins have been shown to be important in facilitating the correct folding and activation of clients. Hsp90 levels and functions are elevated in tumor cells. Here, we computationally predict the regions on the native structures of clients c&#8208;Abl, c&#8208;Src, Cdk4, B&#8208;Raf and Glucocorticoid Receptor, that have the highest probability of undergoing local unfolding, despite being ordered in their native structures. Such regions represent potential ideal interaction points with the Hsp90&#8208;system. We synthesize mimics spanning these regions and confirm their interaction with partners of the Hsp90 complex (Hsp90, Cdc37 and Aha1) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Designed mimics selectively disrupt the association of their respective clients with the Hsp90 machinery, leaving unrelated clients unperturbed and causing apoptosis in cancer cells. Overall, selective targeting of Hsp90 protein&#8208;protein interactions is achieved without causing indiscriminate degradation of all clients, setting the stage for the development of therapeutics based on specific chaperone:client perturbation</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein folding quality control in cells requires the activity of a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones. Heat shock protein&#8208;90 (Hsp90), a multidomain ATP driven molecular machine, is a prime representative of this family of proteins. Interactions between Hsp90, its co&#8208;chaperones, and client proteins have been shown to be important in facilitating the correct folding and activation of clients. Hsp90 levels and functions are elevated in tumor cells. Here, we computationally predict the regions on the native structures of clients c&#8208;Abl, c&#8208;Src, Cdk4, B&#8208;Raf and Glucocorticoid Receptor, that have the highest probability of undergoing local unfolding, despite being ordered in their native structures. Such regions represent potential ideal interaction points with the Hsp90&#8208;system. We synthesize mimics spanning these regions and confirm their interaction with partners of the Hsp90 complex (Hsp90, Cdc37 and Aha1) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Designed mimics selectively disrupt the association of their respective clients with the Hsp90 machinery, leaving unrelated clients unperturbed and causing apoptosis in cancer cells. Overall, selective targeting of Hsp90 protein&#8208;protein interactions is achieved without causing indiscriminate degradation of all clients, setting the stage for the development of therapeutics based on specific chaperone:client perturbation&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Isoleucine residues determine chiral discrimination of odorant&#8208;binding protein</title>
      <dc:description>Enzymes, receptors and carrier proteins discriminate between enantiomers of natural and synthetic chemicals. While the structural details of this phenomenon have been investigated in enzymes and receptors, much less is known for carrier proteins of hydrophobic ligands, particularly concerning the contribution of asymmetric centres in the side chains of amino acids to chirally selective binding. Working with a pig odorant&#8208;binding protein, we have found that the replacement of either one or both isoleucine residues in the binding pocket by leucines abolishes discrimination of menthol and carvone enantiomers. The results indicate that isoleucines are crucial for chiral discrimination of hydrophobic ligands, and that asymmetry in the side chain may be as important as the overall asymmetry of the protein. The results provide suggestions and guidelines for improving chiral selectivity of binding proteins and enzymes, with consequent applications in the production of enantiomerically pure drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Small Sequence&#8208;Sensitive Compounds for Specific Recognition of the G&#8901;C Base Pair in DNA Minor Groove</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of 13 small diamidines with thiophene and modified N&#8208;alkylbenzimidazole &#963;&#8208;hole modules were synthesized to test their binding affinity and selectivity to the DNA minor groove. The newly synthesized compounds showed strong binding and selectivity to AAAGTTT compared to similar sequences AAATTT and AAAGCTTT, and were investigated by biosensor&#8208;SPR, fluorescence spectroscopy, DNA thermal melting, ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics.







Abstract
A series of small diamidines with thiophene and modified N&#8208;alkylbenzimidazole &#963;&#8208;hole module represent specific binding to single G&#8901;C base pair (bp) DNA sequence. The variation of N&#8208;alkyl or aromatic rings were sensitive to microstructures of the DNA minor groove. Thirteen new compounds were synthesized to test their binding affinity and selectivity. The dicyanobenzimidazoles needed to synthesize the target diamidines were made via condensation/cyclization reactions of different aldehydes with different 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(alkyl&#8208; or phenyl&#8208;amino) benzonitriles. The final diamidines were synthesized using lithium bis&#8208;trimethylsilylamide (LiN[Si(CH3)3]2) or Pinner methods. The newly synthesized compounds showed strong binding and selectivity to AAAGTTT compared to similar sequences AAATTT and AAAGCTTT investigated by several biophysical methods including biosensor&#8208;SPR, fluorescence spectroscopy, DNA thermal melting, ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics. The binding affinity results determined by fluorescence spectroscopy are in accordance with those obtained by biosensor&#8208;SPR. These small size single G&#8901;C bp highly specific binders extend the compound database for future biological applications.

      <title>Pressure Sensitivity of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 Condensates as a Model for Postsynaptic Densities and its Biophysical and Neurological Ramifications</title>
      <dc:description>
High pressure sensitivity of postsynaptic densities: Quite unexpectedly, a binary protein condensate mimicking postsynaptic densities, which are protein assemblies underneath the plasma membrane of excitatory synapses, reveals high pressure sensitivity, which may shed light on the biophysical underpinnings of pressure&#8208;related neurological disorders.







Abstract
Biomolecular condensates consisting of proteins and nucleic acids can serve critical biological functions, so that some condensates are referred as membraneless organelles. They can also be disease&#8208;causing, if their assembly is misregulated. A major physicochemical basis of the formation of biomolecular condensates is liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS). In general, LLPS depends on environmental variables, such as temperature and hydrostatic pressure. The effects of pressure on the LLPS of a binary SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 protein system mimicking postsynaptic densities, which are protein assemblies underneath the plasma membrane of excitatory synapses, were investigated. Quite unexpectedly, the model system LLPS is much more sensitive to pressure than the folded states of typical globular proteins. Phase&#8208;separated droplets of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 were found to dissolve into a homogeneous solution already at ten&#8208;to&#8208;hundred bar levels. The pressure sensitivity of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 is seen here as a consequence of both pressure&#8208;dependent multivalent interaction strength and void volume effects. Considering that organisms in the deep sea are under pressures up to about 1&#8197;kbar, this implies that deep&#8208;sea organisms have to devise means to counteract this high pressure sensitivity of biomolecular condensates to avoid harm. Intriguingly, these findings may shed light on the biophysical underpinning of pressure&#8208;related neurological disorders in terrestrial vertebrates.

      <title>BODIPYs as Chemically Stable Fluorescent Tags for Synthetic Glycosylation Strategies towards Fluorescently Labeled Saccharides</title>
      <dc:description>
A colorful solution: Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorophores, conveniently substituted, can endure most of the reaction conditions involved in synthetic sequences leading to oligosaccharides. Thus, BODIPY dyes could be used as aglycons in synthetic routes leading to fluorescently labeled saccharides. Accordingly, BODIPYs display a dual role: as colorful glycosyl&#8208;tags during the synthesis, and as fluorescent&#8208;labels on the ensuing glycosides.







Abstract
A series of fluorescent boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY, 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) dyes have been designed to participate, as aglycons, in synthetic oligosaccharide protocols. As such, they served a dual purpose: first, by being incorporated at the beginning of the process (at the reducing&#8208;end of the growing saccharide moiety), they can function as fluorescent glycosyl tags, facilitating the detection and purification of the desired glycosidic intermediates, and secondly, the presence of these chromophores on the ensuing compounds grants access to fluorescently labeled saccharides. In this context, a sought&#8208;after feature of the fluorescent dyes has been their chemical robustness. Accordingly, some BODIPY derivatives described in this work can withstand the reaction conditions commonly employed in the chemical synthesis of saccharides; namely, glycosylation and protecting&#8208;group manipulations. Regarding their photophysical properties, the BODIPY&#8208;labeled saccharides obtained in this work display remarkable fluorescence efficiency in water, reaching quantum yield values up to 82&#8201;%, as well as notable lasing efficiencies and photostabilities.

&lt;p&gt;A series of fluorescent boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY, 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indacene) dyes have been designed to participate, as aglycons, in synthetic oligosaccharide protocols. As such, they served a dual purpose: first, by being incorporated at the beginning of the process (at the reducing&#8208;end of the growing saccharide moiety), they can function as fluorescent glycosyl tags, facilitating the detection and purification of the desired glycosidic intermediates, and secondly, the presence of these chromophores on the ensuing compounds grants access to fluorescently labeled saccharides. In this context, a sought&#8208;after feature of the fluorescent dyes has been their chemical robustness. Accordingly, some BODIPY derivatives described in this work can withstand the reaction conditions commonly employed in the chemical synthesis of saccharides; namely, glycosylation and protecting&#8208;group manipulations. Regarding their photophysical properties, the BODIPY&#8208;labeled saccharides obtained in this work display remarkable fluorescence efficiency in water, reaching quantum yield values up to 82&#8201;%, as well as notable lasing efficiencies and photostabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Co&#8208;hydrolysis and Seed&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Basic Mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites with Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Seed&#8208;induced synthesis: Basic mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 with adjustable alkaline&#8208;earth metal species have been synthesized by an acid co&#8208;hydrolysis and seed&#8208;induced method. Its mesostructure together with the high dispersity of basic guest species was realized by this non&#8208;classical crystallization process.







Abstract
For zeolite catalysts, the regulation of active site and pore structure plays an important role in the enhancement of their catalytic performance. In this work, a one&#8208;pot and organic template&#8208;free co&#8208;regulation route is proposed to straightforwardly synthesize basic mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with adjustable alkaline&#8208;earth metal species. The synthesis pathway combines two decisive strategies: 1)&#8197;the seed&#8208;induced interface assembly growth method and 2)&#8197;the acidic co&#8208;hydrolysis/condensation of aluminosilicate species and alkaline&#8208;earth metal (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) sources. It is interesting that the mesoporous structure was self&#8208;evolved through particle&#8208;attached seed&#8208;interfacial crystallization without the assistance of any template. Meanwhile, the incorporation of alkaline&#8208;earth metals species is homogeneous and highly dispersed in the solid products during the whole crystallization process, and finally generate the superior basicity. Catalysis tests of the as&#8208;synthesized samples displayed their novel performance in the typical base reaction of Knoevenagel condensation, even for bulky substrates owing to the enhanced diffusion arising from the meso/microporous network. This finding opens new possibilities for facile, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly synthesis of mesoporous high&#8208;silica zeolites with tunable acid/base properties, and deepens our understanding of the particle&#8208;attached crystallization.

      <title>An Enantiopure Propeller&#8208;Like Trityl&#8208;Brominated Radical: Bringing Together a High Racemization Barrier and an Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescent Magnetic Emitter</title>
      <dc:description>
Get radical! An efficient circularly polarized luminescence emitter, based on a persistent trityl radical substituted with bulky bromine atoms at ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, is reported (see figure). In addition, this emitter has a high racemization barrier between its enantiomers.







Abstract
A new persistent organic free radical has been synthetized with Br atoms occupying the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions of a trityl core. After the isolation of its two propeller&#8208;like atropisomers, Plus (P) and minus (M), their absolute configurations were assigned by a combination of theoretical and experimental data. Remarkably, no hints of racemization were observed up to 60&#8201;&#176;C for more than two hours, due to the higher steric hindrance imposed by the bulky Br atoms. Therefore, when compared to its chlorinated homologue (t1/2=18&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C), an outstanding stability against racemization was achieved. A circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response of both enantiomers was detected. This free radical shows a satisfactory luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum(592&#8197;nm)|&#8776;0.7&#215;10&#8722;3) despite its pure organic nature and low luminescence quantum yield (LQY). Improved organic magnetic CPL emitters derived from the reported structure can be envisaged thanks to the wide possibilities that Br atoms at para&#8208;positions offer for further functionalization.

      <title>Live Monitoring of Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide Alkyne Cycloadditions in Complex Reaction Environments by Inline ATR&#8208;IR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking a closer look: We show that azide cycloadditions can be monitored in complex reaction environments by using an inline ATR&#8208;IR probe in a small&#8208;volume reaction flask also facilitating full temperature control. This method enables following bioorthogonal azide cyclooctyne ligations even in biological fluids such as human plasma.







Abstract
The strain&#8208;promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) is a powerful tool for forming covalent bonds between molecules even under physiological conditions, and therefore found broad application in fields ranging from biological chemistry and biomedical research to materials sciences. For many applications, knowledge about reaction kinetics of these ligations is of utmost importance. Kinetics are commonly assessed and studied by NMR measurements. However, these experiments are limited in terms of temperature and restricted to deuterated solvents. By using an inline ATR&#8208;IR probe we show that the cycloaddition of azides and alkynes can be monitored in aqueous and even complex biological fluids enabling the investigation of reaction kinetics in various solvents and even human blood plasma under controlled conditions in low reaction volumes.

Abstract
It is challenging to design metal catalysts for in situ transformation of endogenous biomolecules with good performance inside living cells. Herein, we report a multifunctional metal catalyst, ruthenium&#8208;coordinated oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (OPV&#8208;Ru), for intracellular catalysis of transfer hydrogenation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to its reduced format (NADH). Owing to its amphiphilic characteristic, OPV&#8208;Ru possesses good self&#8208;assembly capability in water to form nanoparticles through hydrophobic interaction and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and numerous positive charges on the surface of nanoparticles displayed a strong electrostatic interaction with negatively charged substrate molecules, creating a local microenvironment for enhancing the catalysis efficiency in comparison to dispersed catalytic center molecule (TOF value was enhanced by about 15&#8197;fold). OPV&#8208;Ru could selectively accumulate in the mitochondria of living cells. Benefiting from its inherent fluorescence, the dynamic distribution in cells and uptake behavior of OPV&#8208;Ru could be visualized under fluorescence microscopy. This work represents the first demonstration of a multifunctional organometallic complex catalyzing natural hydrogenation transformation in specific subcellular compartments of living cells with excellent performance, fluorescent imaging ability, specific mitochondria targeting and good chemoselectivity with high catalysis efficiency.

      <title>Rapid Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of CdS/Graphene/MoSx Tunable Heterojunctions and Their Application in Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
2D/2D graphene/MoSx heterojunctions are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in CdS&#8208;based hybrids for photocatalytic activity enhancement. The rapid microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic protocol requires moderate temperatures. The enhanced photodegradation of nitroarene is attributed to a few advantageous synergetic parameters, such as intimate contacts between the components of the hybrid and the chemical speciation of the nanostructured materials.







Abstract
Nanoscale two&#8208;dimensional nanostructures have shown great potential as functional components in photocatalysis. Here, investigations on the synthesis of heterostructured hybrids, comprised of 0D CdS nanoparticles as semiconductor and 2D/2D graphene/MoSx as co&#8208;catalyst, are reported. The approach involves a rapid microwave&#8208;assisted reaction in autoclave conditions, by adopting either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step protocol. The chemical speciation of the nanocomposites was found to depend strongly on the compounding conditions of the precursor substances. The photocatalytic activity was assessed by monitoring the photodegradation rate of 4&#8208;nitrophenol in solution using simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of the hybrids may be attributed to a combination of beneficial characteristics, strongly related to the chemical speciation of the composite components. Moreover, intimate contacts of the latter result in efficient heterojunctions. Overall, the present study provides valuable insight into the development of functional heterostructured photocatalysts comprised of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.

Moreover, intimate contacts of the latter result in efficient heterojunctions. Overall, the present study provides valuable insight into the development of functional heterostructured photocatalysts comprised of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

Sustainability: Electrocatalysis will play a key role in a proposed man&#8208;made, sustainable future. An energy infrastructure without using fossil fuels is a blue map. It can be a hydrogen&#8208;based energy system, involving the hydrogen production from solar&#8208;driven water electrolysis and the hydrogen fuel cell, or it can be a closed carbon cycle using carbon dioxide electrolysis techniques. Zero&#8208;carbon emission cannot be achieved without electrocatalysis.

      <title>Identification and Nanomechanical Characterization of the HIV Tat&#8208;Amyloid &#946; Peptide Multifibrillar Structures</title>

      <title>Synergistic Biophysical Techniques Reveal Structural Mechanisms of Engineered Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides in Lipid Model Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>In the quest for new antibiotics, two novel engineered Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides (eCAPs) have been rationally designed. WLBU2 and D8 (all 8 valines are the D&#8208;enantiomer) efficiently kill both gram&#8208;negative and &#8211;positive bacteria, but WLBU2 is toxic and D8 non&#8208;toxic to eukaryotic cells. We explore protein secondary structure, location of peptides in six lipid model membranes, changes in membrane structure and pore evidence.&#160; We suggest that protein secondary structure is not a critical determinant of bactericidal activity, but that membrane thinning and dual location of WLBU2 and D8 in the membrane headgroup and hydrocarbon region may be important. While neither peptide thins the gram&#8208;negative lipopolysaccharide outer membrane model, both locate deep into its hydrocarbon region where they are primed for self&#8208;promoted uptake into the periplasm. The partially &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure of WLBU2 in a red blood cell (RBC) membrane model containing 50% cholesterol, could play a role in destabilizing this RBC membrane model causing pore formation that is not observed with the D8 random coil, which correlates with RBC hemolysis caused by WLBU2 but not by D8.</dc:description>

      <title>Endohedral Metallofullerenes: New Structures and Unseen Phenomena</title>
      <dc:description>
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) serve as an ideal platform for the study of otherwise unstable metallic clusters owing to the protection afforded by fullerene cages. Herein, a systematic and comprehensive summary of the recent results of EMFs is presented according to the categories of monometallofullerenes, dimetallofullerenes, carbide clusterfullerenes, and nitride clusterfullerenes.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs), namely fullerenes with metallic species encapsulated inside, represent an ideal platform to investigate metal&#8211;metal or metal&#8211;carbon interactions at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) crystallography. Herein, recent progress in the identification of new structures and unprecedented properties are discussed according to the categories of monometallofullerenes, dimetallofullerenes, carbide clusterfullerenes, and nitride clusterfullerenes. In particular, the dimerization and the cage&#8208;isomer dependent oxidation state of the inner metal atom are summarized in terms of pristine monometallofullerenes. Metal&#8211;metal bonds involving lanthanide&#8211;lanthanides or actinide&#8211;actinides are discussed based on both experimental and theoretical studies. The cluster&#8211;cage matching and/or mutual selections, as well as the rarely seen M=C double bonds, are discovered in M2C2@C2n, U2C@C80, M2TiC@C80, and Ti3C3@C80. Subsequently, the geometries of different M3N clusters in various cages are discussed, revealing size&#8208;matching between the internal M3N cluster and the outer cage induced by the planarity of the cluster. Finally, an outlook regarding the future developments of the molecular structures and applications of EMFs is presented.

Constructing high&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust oxygen electrocatalysts toward rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries remains a big challenge. Herein, metallic Ni3Fe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in 3D porous N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel was prepared through a facile hydrothermal assembly and calcination process.

      <title>An Alumanylyttrium Complex with an Absorption due to a Transition from the Al&#8722;Y Bond to an Unoccupied d&#8208;Orbital</title>

Al finds Y: The reaction between a dialkyl&#8208;Al anion and [Y(CH2SiMe3)2(thf)3][BPh4] gave (dialkylalumanyl)yttrium complex&#8197;2, possessing the unprecedented 2&#8197;center&#8211;2&#8197;electron Al&#8722;Y bond as characterized by the NMR spectra and X&#8208;ray analysis.

Abstract
The reaction between a dialkyl&#8208;substituted alumanyl anion and [Y(CH2SiMe3)2(thf)3][BPh4] resulted in the formation of (dialkylalumanyl)yttrium complex&#8197;2, which exhibits the first 2&#8208;center&#8211;2&#8208;electron (2&#8201;c&#8208;2&#8201;e) Al&#8722;Y bond. The 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of 2 together with an X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicated a C2v symmetrical structure. DFT calculations on 2 revealed that its LUMO consists of overlapping 3&#8201;p&#8208; and 4&#8201;d&#8208;orbitals of the Al and Y atoms, respectively, and that the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is narrow. The UV/Vis spectrum of 2 exhibited a visible absorption at 432&#8197;nm, which suggests that the strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting character of the three&#8208;coordinate dialkylalumanyl ligand generates a colored d0&#8208;complex that does not contain any &#960;&#8208;electrons.

      <title>Spin Crossover and Long&#8208;lived Excited States in a Reduced Molecular Ruby</title>
      <dc:description>The chromium(III) complex [CrIII(ddpd)2]3+ (molecular ruby) is reduced to the genuine chromium(II) complex [CrII(ddpd)2]2+ with d4 electron configuration. This reduced molecular ruby represents one of the very few chromium(II) complexes showing spin crossover (SCO). The reversible SCO is gradual with Tc around room temperature.

Excitation of [CrII(ddpd)2]2+ with UV light at 20 and 290 K generates electronically excited states with microsecond lifetimes.

      <title>Nanobody&#8208;Ferritin Conjugate for Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ferritin is an iron&#8208;storage protein nanocage assembled by 24 subunits. The hollow cavity of ferritin enables its encapsulation of various therapeutic agents. Antibody&#8208;ferritin conjugate provides an effective approach for the targeted drug delivery. However, the complicated preparation and protein stability hampers wide applications of this system. Herein, we designed a novel nanobody&#8208;ferritin platform (Nb&#8208;Ftn) for targeted drug delivery. The site&#8208;specific conjugation between nanobody and ferritin is achieved by transglutaminase catalyzed protein ligation. This ligation strategy allows the Nb&#8208;conjugation after drug loading in ferritin, which avoids the deactivation of nanobody from the harsh pH required for drug encapsulation. To verify the tumor targeting of this Nb&#8208;Ftn platform, a photodynamic reagent, manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) was loaded into the ferritin cavity, and an anti&#8208;EGFR nanobody was conjugated to the surface of ferritin. The ferritin nanocage can encapsulate about 82 MnPc molecules. This MnPc@Nb&#8208;Ftn conjugate can be efficiently internalized by EGFR positive A431 cancer cells, but not by EGFR negative MCF&#8208;7 cells. Upon 730 nm laser irradiation, MnPc@Nb&#8208;Ftn selectively killed EGFR positive A431 cells by generating ROS, whereas no obvious damage was observed on MCF&#8208;7 cells. As ferritin can be used for encapsulation of various therapeutic agents, this work provides a strategy for facile construction of nanobody&#8208;ferritin for targeted drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>CHEMICAL FUNCTIONISATION OF 2D MATERIALS VIA BATCH AND CONTINUOUS HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS</title>
      <dc:description>2D materials are single or few layered materials consisting of one or several elements with a thickness of a few nanometers. Their unique, tunable physical and chemical properties including ease of chemical functionalization makes this class of materials useful in a variety of technological applications. The feasibility of 2D materials strongly depends on better synthetic approaches to improve properties, increase performance and durability and reduce costs. As such, in the synthesis of nanomaterials, hydrothermal processes are widely adopted through a precursor&#8208;product synthesis route. This method includes batch or continuous flow systems, both employing water at elevated temperatures (above boiling point) and pressures to fine tune the physical, chemical, optical and electronic properties of the nanomaterial. Both techniques yield particles with different morphology, size and surface area due to different mechanisms of particle formation. In this review, we present batch and continuous hydrothermal synthesis of a selection of 2D derivatives (graphene, MXene and molybdenum disulphide), their chemical functionalisation as an advantageous approach in exploring properties of these materials as well as the benefits and challenges of employing these processes, and an outlook for further research.</dc:description>

      <title>Towards the Molecular Design of Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes of 2,6&#8208;Bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines</title>

Spinning around: First N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines to induce a spin&#8208;crossover in otherwise high&#8208;spin iron(II) complexes are obtained by increasing, against the common wisdom, the steric demand of a bulky substituent.

Abstract
The molecular design of spin&#8208;crossover complexes relies on controlling the spin state of a transition metal ion by proper chemical modifications of the ligands. Herein, the first N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines (3&#8208;bpp) are reported that, against the common wisdom, induce a spin&#8208;crossover in otherwise high&#8208;spin iron(II) complexes by increasing the steric demand of a bulky substituent, an ortho&#8208;functionalized phenyl group. As N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;bpp complexes have no pendant NH groups that make their spin state extremely sensitive to the environment, the proposed ligand design, which may be applicable to isomeric 1&#8208;bpp or other families of popular bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and higher denticity ligands, opens the way for their molecular design as spin&#8208;crossover compounds for future breakthrough applications.

      <title>Docking Site Modulation of Isostructural Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>
Go organic! By decorating either methoxyl, hydroxyl, or both groups on the channel walls of TPBP&#8208;COFs, highly efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2 under mild conditions is realized. Specifically, the COF with both hydroxyl and methoxyl groups (OMe&#8208;OH&#8208;TPBP&#8208;COF) exhibits the highest catalytic activity and efficiency for CO2 cycloaddition (see figure).







Abstract
Three isostructural covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with either methoxyl, hydroxyl, or both groups on the channel wall, are synthesized and served as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2. Among them, the COF decorated with both hydroxyl and methoxyl groups named OMe&#8208;OH&#8208;TPBP&#8208;COF exhibits the highest catalytic activity and efficiency for CO2 cycloaddition under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go organic&lt;/b&gt;! By decorating either methoxyl, hydroxyl, or both groups on the channel walls of TPBP&#8208;COFs, highly efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts for chemical fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions is realized. Specifically, the COF with both hydroxyl and methoxyl groups (OMe&#8208;OH&#8208;TPBP&#8208;COF) exhibits the highest catalytic activity and efficiency for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition (see figure).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three isostructural covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with either methoxyl, hydroxyl, or both groups on the channel wall, are synthesized and served as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts for chemical fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Among them, the COF decorated with both hydroxyl and methoxyl groups named OMe&#8208;OH&#8208;TPBP&#8208;COF exhibits the highest catalytic activity and efficiency for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New One&#8208;Pot Fluorescence Derivatization Strategy for Highly Sensitive MicroRNA Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>
microRNAs made easy: A one&#8208;pot fluorescence derivatization strategy has been developed for highly sensitive microRNA analysis. Based on this derivatization strategy, a facile and sensitive high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography method was developed for quantitative assay of microRNAs.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate the expression of over 30&#8201;% of mammalian genes during development and apoptosis, and abnormal expression of miRNAs may lead to a range of human pathologies. Therefore, analysis of miRNAs is valuable for disease diagnostics. In this work, a novel one&#8208;pot fluorescence derivatization strategy was developed for miRNA analysis. The mechanism of the derivatization reaction was explored by using instrumental methods, including liquid chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Highly fluorescent N6&#8208;ethenoadenine (&#1013;&#8208;adenine) was formed and detached from the miRNA sequence through the reaction of adenine in nucleic acids with 2&#8208;chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) at 100&#8201;&#176;C. This is the first experimental evidence that the cooperation of formed &#1013;&#8208;adenine and water&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between the proton at the 2&#8242;&#8208; and the oxyanion at 3&#8242;&#8208;positions stabilized the oxocarbenium significantly, which makes the depurination and derivatization of miRNA highly effective. Based on this derivatization strategy, a facile and sensitive high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography method was developed for quantitative assay of miRNAs. In combination with magnetic solid&#8208;phase extraction (MSPE), the HPLC method was shown to be useful for the determination of microRNAs at sub&#8208;picomolar level in serum samples.

      <title>Electronic Properties of Oxidized Cyclometalated Diiridium Complexes: Spin Delocalization Controlled by the Mutual Position of the Iridium Centers</title>
      <dc:description>
Two isomer pairs of cyclometalated diiridium complexes, with IrCp*Cl termini bridged by 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(p&#8208;tolyliminoethyl)benzene, or 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, were prepared and fully characterized. Their different bonding and electronic properties in the neutral and monocationic states were studied by experimental spectroelectrochemical methods and DFT/TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Four cyclometalated diiridium complexes, with IrCp*Cl (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5&#8722;) termini bridged by 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(p&#8208;tolyliminoethyl)benzene (1, 2), or 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene (3, 4), were prepared and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (complexes&#8197;1, 2, and 4). The two iridium centers in complexes&#8197;1 and 3 are thus bound at the central benzene ring in the para&#8208;position (trans&#8208;Ir2), whereas those in complexes&#8197;2 and 4 are in the meta&#8208;position (cis&#8208;Ir2). Cyclic voltammograms of all four complexes show two consecutive one&#8208;electron oxidations. The potential difference between the two anodic steps in 1 and 3 is distinctly larger than that for 2 and 4. The visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8211;short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) absorption spectra of trans&#8208;Ir2 monocations&#8197;1+ and 3+ are markedly different from those of cis&#8208;Ir2 monocations&#8197;2+ and 4+. Notably, strong near&#8208;infrared electronic absorption appears only in the spectra of 1+ and 3+ whereas 2+ and 4+ absorb only weakly in the NIR&#8208;SWIR region. Combined DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations have revealed that (a)&#8197;1+ and 3+ (the diiridium&#8208;benzene trans&#8208;isomers) display the highest occupied spin&#8208;orbitals (HOSO) and the lowest unoccupied spin&#8208;orbital (LUSO) evenly delocalized over both molecule halves, and (b)&#8197;their electronic absorptions in the NIR&#8208;SWIR region are attributed to mixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfers (MLCT and LLCT). In contrast, cis&#8208;isomers&#8197;2+ and 4+ do not feature this stabilizing &#960;&#8208;delocalization but a localized mixed&#8208;valence state showing a weak intervalence charge&#8208;transfer (IVCT) absorption in the SWIR region.

      <title>Rational Stepwise Construction of Different Heterometallic&#8211;Organic Frameworks (HMOFs) for Highly Efficient CO2 Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
CO2 conversion: Two kinds of heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs) were obtained by using the monometallic complexes as the precursors based on a rational stepwise construction strategy and the theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB principle). These isolated MOFs were employed to study their catalytic efficacy in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. This work may provide a valuable approach towards tailoring more HMOFs with great catalytic activity.







Abstract
The coordination preference of different metal ions and ligands have an immense influence on the constructions of functional MOF materials. In this work, two new monometallic complexes, namely [Ag(HL)(bipy)0.5] (1) and {[Tb(L)1.5(H2O)]&#8901;4&#8201;H2O}n (2) (bipy=4,4&#8208;bipyridine), have been synthesized successfully by employing a bifunctional 2&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)terephthalic acid (H2L) ligand. After that, two new different heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs), namely {[TbAg(L)2(H2O)3]&#8901;H2O}n (3) and [TbAg(L)2(H2O)]n (4), were obtained from complexes&#8197;1 and 2 as the precursors based on a rational stepwise construction strategy and the theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB principle), respectively. The HMOFs bearing dual metallic catalytic sites (Tb and Ag) can be used as heterogeneous catalysts without losing performance for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxides including the sterically hindered epoxides, demonstrating some of the highest reported catalytic activity values. This work may provide a new synthetic route toward tailoring new HMOFs with excellent catalytic activity.

      <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Binder&#8208;Free Capacitive Deionization Electrode for Highly Efficient Sea Water Desalination</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;capacitive electrodes: Binder&#8208;free deionization electrodes fabricated by electrodeposition of SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier exhibiting a combination of pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance show excellent performance in water desalination due to the synergistic effect between the polyoxometalate and the polymer.







Abstract
Capacitive deionization is a promising technique in sea water desalination. Compared with common electrodes, mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes exhibit better performance in sea water desalination because they integrate pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance in one system. Herein, a 3D binder&#8208;free mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode was fabricated by direct electrodeposition of SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. In this electrode, SiW12O404&#8722;/polyaniline composite particles with a size of about 100&#8211;120&#8197;nm are dispersed homogenously on the 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. Its specific capacitance reaches 352&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. With increasing current from 1 to 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacitance only decays by 32&#8201;%. When employed in sea water desalination, the performance of this mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode is also excellent. At 1.2&#8197;V, the salt adsorption capacity of this mixed electrode reaches 23.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a salt adsorption rate of 1.38&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 in 500&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NaCl. The performance of this electrode is well retained after 30 cycles. The excellent sea water desalination performance originates from the synergistic effect between SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline. This work has developed polyoxometalate as a new material for capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mixed&#8208;capacitive electrodes&lt;/b&gt;: Binder&#8208;free deionization electrodes fabricated by electrodeposition of SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier exhibiting a combination of pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance show excellent performance in water desalination due to the synergistic effect between the polyoxometalate and the polymer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitive deionization is a promising technique in sea water desalination. Compared with common electrodes, mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes exhibit better performance in sea water desalination because they integrate pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance in one system. Herein, a 3D binder&#8208;free mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode was fabricated by direct electrodeposition of SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. In this electrode, SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/polyaniline composite particles with a size of about 100&#8211;120&#8197;nm are dispersed homogenously on the 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. Its specific capacitance reaches 352&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With increasing current from 1 to 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the specific capacitance only decays by 32&#8201;%. When employed in sea water desalination, the performance of this mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode is also excellent. At 1.2&#8197;V, the salt adsorption capacity of this mixed electrode reaches 23.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a salt adsorption rate of 1.38&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 500&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; NaCl. The performance of this electrode is well retained after 30 cycles. The excellent sea water desalination performance originates from the synergistic effect between SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;

      <title>Two Orthogonal Halogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions Directed 2D Crystalline Supramolecular J&#8208;Dimer Lamellae</title>
      <dc:description>
An intriguing 2D lamellar dye&#8208;assembly with distinct dye organization in aqueous media driven by two orthogonal X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X halogen&#8208;bonding interactions was constructed. As the only building motif, antiparallel J&#8208;dimer was formed and stabilized by single &#960;&#8208;stacking and dual X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The constituent J&#8208;dimer units were linked by quadruple highly directional X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X bonds in a staggered manner, resulting in the unique 2D dye&#8208;lamellae (see figure).







Abstract
Dye assemblies exhibit fascinating properties and performances, both of which depend critically on the mutual packing arrangement of dyes and on the supramolecular architecture. Herein, we engineered, for the first time, an intriguing chlorosome&#8208;mimetic 2D crystalline J&#8208;dimer lamellar structure based on halogenated dyes in aqueous media by employing two distinct orthogonal halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions. As the only building motif, antiparallel J&#8208;dimer was formed and stabilized by single &#960;&#8208;stacking and dual halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. With two substituted halogen atoms acting as XB donors and the other two acting as acceptors, the constituent J&#8208;dimer units were linked by quadruple highly&#8208;directional halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen interactions in a staggered manner, resulting in unique 2D lamellar dye assemblies. This work champions and advances halogen&#8208;bonding as a remarkably potent tool for engineering dye aggregates with a controlled molecular packing arrangement and supramolecular architecture.

      <title>Recent Advances in Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Going with the flow: In recent years, continuous&#8208;flow techniques have received considerable attention and shown rapid progress in manufacturing. Among these, catalytic enantioselective flow processes using homogeneous, heterogeneous, or enzymatic catalysts have shown significant advantages over the conventional batch mode. In this Minireview, recent advances in continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective catalysis are summarized and discussed, with emphasis on studies published after 2013.







Abstract
The increased demand for more efficient, safe, and green production in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry calls for the development of continuous&#8208;flow manufacturing, and for chiral chemicals in particular, enantioselective catalytic processes. In recent years, this emerging direction has received considerable attention and has seen rapid progress. In most cases, catalytic enantioselective flow processes using homogeneous, heterogeneous, or enzymatic catalysts have shown significant advantages over the conventional batch mode, such as shortened reaction times, lower catalysts loadings, and higher selectivities in addition to the normal merits of non&#8208;enantioselective flow operations. In this Minireview, the advancements, key strategies, methods, and technologies developed the last six years as well as remaining challenges are summarized.

      <title>A Mechanistically and Operationally Simple Route to Metal&#8211;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
No free carbene required: Computational and experimental investigations of a weak base&#8208;assisted synthetic route leading to metal&#8211;NHC complexes suggest a concerted mechanism is at play. The method is exemplified with metal and nonmetal centers and establishes its synthetic utility.







Abstract
We have been puzzled by the involvement of weak organic and inorganic bases in the synthesis of metal&#8211;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. Such bases are insufficiently strong to permit the presumed required deprotonation of the azolium salt (the carbene precursor) prior to metal binding. Experimental and computational studies provide support for a base&#8208;assisted concerted process that does not require free NHC formation. The synthetic protocol was found applicable to a number of transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and main&#8208;group&#8208;centered NHC compounds and could become the synthetic route of choice to form M&#8211;NHC bonds.

      <title>Enhanced Long Persistent Luminescence by Multi&#8208;fold Interpenetration in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with long persistent luminescence (LPL) have caused widespread attention due to potential applications in displaying, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and so on. However, MOF materials are often with large pore size, which restricts the formation of efficient inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions to realize LPL. Herein, we report a new approach to achieve LPL in MOFs by multi&#8208;fold interpenetration of discrete frameworks. By the comparison between 3&#8208;fold and 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating MOFs, we found that the former with higher multiplicity and denser frameworks can be endowed with enhanced inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions, and thus prolonged long persistent luminescence is obtained. Meanwhile, metal cluster and heavy halogen effect could also arouse variations in LPL durations and colours.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Construction of 2D Fe3O4@Carbon Core&#8208;Shell nanosheets as Advanced Anode Materials for High Performance Lithium Ion Half/Full Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal oxides vastly limit practical applications due to their rapid capacity decay as an electrode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we have successfully employed a versatile strategy to mitigate the volume expansion and low conductivity of Fe  3  O  4  via coating a thin carbon layer on the surface of Fe  3  O  4  nanosheets (NSs). Benefiting from the 2D core&#8208;shell structures, the Fe  3  O  4  @C NSs exhibit significantly improved rate performance and cycle capability compared to bare Fe  3  O  4  NSs. Along with 200 cycles, the discharge capacity at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  is shown to be 963 mAh g  &#8208;1  (93% retained). Moreover, the lithium storage reaction mechanism is detailed studied by ex situ XRD and HRTEM techniques. When coupled with the commercial LiFePO  4  cathode, the full&#8208;cell retains a capacity of 133 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  , demonstrating its superior energy storage performance.

      <title>Exfoliation of 2D Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The fascinating properties of single&#8208;layer graphene isolated by mechanical exfoliation have inspired extensive research efforts toward two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. Layered compounds serve as precursors for atomically thin 2D materials (briefly, 2D nanomaterials) owing to their strong intraplane chemical bonding but weak interplane van der Waals interactions. There are newly emerging 2D materials beyond graphene, and it is becoming increasingly important to develop cost&#8208;effective, scalable methods for producing 2D nanomaterials with controlled microstructures and properties. The variety of developed synthetic techniques can be categorized into two classes: bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches. Of top&#8208;down approaches, the exfoliation of bulk 2D materials into single or few layers is the most common. This review highlights chemical and physical exfoliation methods that allow for the production of 2D nanomaterials in large quantities.

      <title>Hetero Co&#8208;Encapsulation within a Supramolecular Cage. Moving Away from the Statistical Distribution of Different Guests</title>
      <dc:description>Beside sensing and delivery, another peculiar property arising from confinement in discrete molecular hosts comes from the possibility to have in close proximity, and in defined position, two different molecules (hetero co&#8208;encapsulation). This phenomenon can be tuned considering steric and electronic properties of the guests. In this work, a study on the parameters affecting homo and hetero co&#8208;encapsulation processes within a supramolecular cage is reported. In particular, different benzoate guests were bound within a supramolecular cage containing two metal binding sites and the experimental binding thermodynamics measured. Unexpectedly, from competition experiments we observed that the maximum concentration of hetero co&#8208;encapsulation is achieved if a weakly binding guest is used to partially displace a strongly binding guest.</dc:description>

All compounds have been characterized by multinuclear, including 45Sc NMR spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations of these intensely colored arene complexes confirm scandium to be in the oxidation state +3. The intense absorptions observed in the UV&#8208;vis spectra are due to ligand to metal charge transfer.

      <title>Experimental Evidence for the Incorporation of Two Metals at Equivalent Lattice Positions in Mixed&#8208;Metal Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Two is company: The incorporation of Fe and Cu on crystallographically equivalent positions in a phase&#8208;pure mixed&#8208;metal HKUST&#8208;1 material was proven using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, this study showed that the presence of small amounts of other phases, which seemed neglectable based on standard characterization techniques, must not be ignored, since they might contain a major amount of one of the used metals.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing multiple metals distributed over crystallographically equivalent framework positions (mixed&#8208;metal MOFs) represent an interesting class of materials, since the close vicinity of isolated metal centers often gives rise to synergistic effects. However, appropriate characterization techniques for detailed investigations of these mixed&#8208;metal metal&#8211;organic framework materials, particularly addressing the distribution of metals within the lattice, are rarely available. The synthesis of mixed&#8208;metal FeCuBTC materials in direct syntheses proved to be difficult and only a thorough characterization using various techniques, like powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, unambiguously evidenced the formation of a mixed&#8208;metal FeCuBTC material with HKUST&#8208;1 structure, which contained bimetallic Fe&#8722;Cu paddlewheels as well as monometallic Cu&#8722;Cu and Fe&#8722;Fe units under optimized synthesis conditions. The in&#8208;depth characterization showed that other synthetic procedures led to impurities, which contained the majority of the applied iron and were impossible or difficult to identify using solely standard characterization techniques. Therefore, this study shows the necessity to characterize mixed&#8208;metal MOFs extensively to unambiguously prove the incorporation of both metals at the desired positions. The controlled positioning of metal centers in mixed&#8208;metal metal&#8211;organic framework materials and the thorough characterization thereof is particularly important to derive structure&#8211;property or structure&#8211;activity correlations.

      <title>Synthetic and Biological Studies on New Urea and Triazole Containing Cystobactamid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Fighting Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria: Thirteen new cystobactamids, derived from cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 are prepared by chemical synthesis. Main modifications are exchange of the amide group by the chemically more stable urea group and the triazole ring as located in ring A. Antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive bacteria including a multidrug&#8208;resistant strain can be preserved, when the urea function is located between rings A and B and the triazole is positioned between rings C and D.







Abstract
Cystobactamids belong to the group of arene&#8208;based oligoamides that effectively inhibit bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. Cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 is the most active member of these antibiotics. Most amide bonds present in the cystobactamids link benzoic acids with anilines and it was found that some of these amide bonds undergo chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, especially the one linking ring C with ring D. This work reports on the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of thirteen new cystobactamids that still contain the methoxyaspartate hinge. However, we exchanged selected amide bonds either by the urea or the triazole groups and modified ring A in the latter case. While hydrolytic stability could be improved with these structural substitutes, the high antibacterial potency of cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 could only be preserved in selected cases. This includes derivatives, in which the urea group is positioned between rings A and B and where the triazole is found between rings C and D.

Arylation: Monoarylation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of 8&#8208;methylquinolines is disclosed along with symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylation of 8&#8208;methylquinolines in one&#8208;pot and sequential manner, respectively.

Abstract
Herein, the RhIII&#8208;catalyzed selective monoarylation and diarylation (symmetrical and unsymmetrical) of 8&#8208;methylquinolines with organoboron reagents are disclosed. The selective monoarylation of primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is achieved by using 7&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methylquinolines or by changing the quantity of the aryl boronic acids. The method is also applicable for the arylation of 2&#8208;ethylpyridines, and the heteroarylation with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acids. Symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylation of 8&#8208;methylquinolines have been carried out in one&#8208;pot and sequential manner, respectively. Late&#8208;stage monoarylation of oxime derivatives and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of monoarylated products has also been carried out. A mechanistic study revealed that the current reaction is first order with respect to both reactants and a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate may be involved in the catalytic cycle.

Organic phosphorescence is closely related to the intermolecular interactions, because such interactions are beneficial to promote SOC and boost ISC efficiency and finally conducive to achieve satisfactory phosphorescence.

      <dc:description>The preparation of an all supramolecular multi&#8208;chromophoric azaborondipyrromethene (  ABDP  ) / zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (  ZnTPP  ) / exfoliated graphene (  GR  ) nanoensemble is accomplished. The  ABDP  derivative bears glycol chains for enhancing solubility and a pyridine functionality for allowing coordination with  ZnTPP  . The  ABDP  /  ZnTPP/GR  nanoensemble is characterized with regards to morphology and composition using complementary microscopy imaging, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman and steady state and time resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The photophysical and electrochemical assessment of  ABDP  /  ZnTPP/GR  as well as the binding properties of the  ABDP  /  ZnTPP  complex employed as reference are presented. Energy and electron transfer events were observed in  ABDP  /  ZnTPP  upon photoexcitation.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The preparation of an all supramolecular multi&#8208;chromophoric azaborondipyrromethene (  ABDP  ) / zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (  ZnTPP  ) / exfoliated graphene (  GR  ) nanoensemble is accomplished. The  ABDP  derivative bears glycol chains for enhancing solubility and a pyridine functionality for allowing coordination with  ZnTPP  . The  ABDP  /  ZnTPP/GR  nanoensemble is characterized with regards to morphology and composition using complementary microscopy imaging, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman and steady state and time resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The photophysical and electrochemical assessment of  ABDP  /  ZnTPP/GR  as well as the binding properties of the  ABDP  /  ZnTPP  complex employed as reference are presented. Energy and electron transfer events were observed in  ABDP  /  ZnTPP  upon photoexcitation. However, in the case of  ABDP  /  ZnTPP/GR  , the graphene induced aggregation of the chromophores alters their electronic interactions, enhancing the energy/electron transfer process between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Hydration Change in a Gd&#8208;Based MRI Contrast Agent with a Phosphonated Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
The size of water: Around physiological pH, a pH&#8208;dependent hydration change is observed in a Gd complex, engendering large changes in its relaxivity properties. Protonation of the ligand induces hydrogen bonding within the phosphonated arms with the concomitant entry of a second water molecule.







Abstract
The heptadentate ligand L was shown to form an extremely stable Gd complex at neutral pH with a pGd value of 18.4 at pH&#8197;7.4. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the complexes formed with Gd and Tb displayed two very different coordination behaviors being, respectively, octa&#8208; and nonacoordinated. The relaxometric properties of the Gd complex were studied by field&#8208;dependent relaxivity measurements at various temperatures and by 17O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The pH&#8208;dependence of the longitudinal relaxivity profile indicated large changes around neutral pH leading to a very large value of 10.1&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8901;s&#8722;1 (60&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K) at pH&#8197;4.7. The changes were attributed to an increase of the hydration number from one water molecule in basic conditions to two at acidic pH. A similar trend was observed for the luminescence of the Eu complex, confirming the change in hydration state. DOSY experiments were performed on the Lu analogue, pointing to the absence of dimers in solution in the considered pH range. A breathing mode of the complex was postulated, which was further supported by 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of the Yb complex at varying pH and was finally modeled by DFT calculations.

      <title>An Isolable Bis(Silanone&#8211;Borane) Adduct</title>
      <dc:description>
Si=O&#8594;B in a bis(silanone): Reaction of ferrocene&#8208;bridged bis(silylene&#8211;borane) 2, prepared from the bis(silylene) and BPh3, with CO2 quantitatively generates a Lewis acid&#8208;stabilized bis(silanone) 3 with two Si=O&#8594;B moieties. Removal off BPh3 with PMe3 yields 1,3,2,4&#8208;cyclodisiloxane 4 through intramolecular Si=O head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization. In contrast, reaction of 2 with elemental sulfur furnishes the borane&#8208;free bis(silathione) 5.







Abstract
The reaction of bis(silylenyl)&#8208;substituted ferrocene 1 with two molar equivalents of BPh3 yields the corresponding bis(silylene&#8211;borane) Lewis adduct 2. The latter is capable to activate CO2 to furnish the borane&#8208;stabilized bis(silanone) 3 through mono&#8208;oxygenation of the dative SiII&#8594;B silicon centers under release of CO. Removal of BPh3 from 3 with PMe3 affords the corresponding 1,3,2,4&#8208;cyclodisiloxane and the Me3P&#8722;BPh3 adduct. All isolated new compounds were characterized and their molecular structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

      <title>Factors Governing the Activity of a&#8208;MnO2 Catalysts in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Conductivity vs. Exposed Surface Area of Cryptomelane</title>
      <dc:description>Cryptomelane (&#945;&#8208;(K)MnO  2  ) powders were synthesized by different methods leading to only minor differences in their bulk crystal structure and chemical composition, while the BET surface area and the crystallize size differed significantly. Their performance in OER covered a wide range and their sequence of increasing activity differed when electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte and chemical water oxidation using Ce  4+  were compared. The decisive factors that explain this difference were identified in the catalysts&#8217; microstructure. Chemical water oxidation activity is substantially governed by the exposed surface area, while the electrocatalytic activity is determined largely by the electric conductivity, which was found to correlate with the particle morphology in terms of needle length and aspect ratio in this sample series. This correlation is rather explained by an improved conductivity due to longer needles than by structure sensitivity as was supported by reference experiments using H  2  O  2  decomposition and carbon black as additive. The most active catalyst R&#8208;Cryptomelane reached a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8209;2  at a potential 1.73 V without, and at 1.71 V in presence of carbon black. The improvement was significantly higher for catalyst with lower initial activity. However, the materials showed a disappointing catalytic stability during alkaline electrochemical OER, while the crystal structure was found to be stable at working conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Scholl&#8208;Type Cycloheptatriene Ring Closure of 1,4,9,12&#8208;Tetraarylfenestrindanes: Reactivity and Selectivity in the Construction of Fenestrane&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Saddles</title>
      <dc:description>
Saddle up! The reactivity of thirteen symmetrical and two unsymmetrical tetraarylfenestrindanes towards fourfold Scholl&#8208;type heptagonal ring closure to generate the corresponding saddle&#8208;shaped derivatives was examined, with six new successful examples. The reaction mechanism and the observed selectivity of the twofold cyclization were also investigated by both experiments and DFT calculations (DDQ=dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone).







Abstract
The Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation, generating up to four cycloheptatriene rings around a fenestrindane core, leads to novel, saddle&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbon derivatives. In this article, we present the results of in&#8208;depth experimental and computational work on the oxidative cyclization of various 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes. In particular, the kinetic control of the four&#8208;step cyclization of the electronically activated tetrakis(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) derivative is elucidated. The reasons for the exclusive emergence of one single among the three possible doubly cyclized intermediates and for the nonappearance of the singly and triply cyclized intermediates are clarified. In addition, the origin of the concomitant bridgehead hydroxylation is studied. The reactivity of a set of fifteen symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes towards Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation is presented, pinpointing the structural factors that underlie this reaction and demonstrating the potential and limitations of this synthetic approach. A particularly surprising finding of this study is that the electronically nonactivated 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraphenylfenestrindane can also undergo the fourfold Scholl&#8208;type cyclization process and can be transformed into the parent saddle hydrocarbon.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Generation of Benzynes from Phenols: Formation of Primary Anilines by the Deoxyamination of Phenols</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct and selective: Benzynes have been selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.







Abstract
Benzynes were selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. The direct conversion of a phenolic hydroxyl group into a free amino group is a useful method for the preparation of primary aryl amines that are hard to synthesize by using coupling reactions involving phenol derivatives with ammonia. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.

      <dc:description>
N,N&#8242;&#8208;Ethylene bridged bis&#8208;2&#8208;aryl pyrrolinium cations are reported in this work, which (a)&#8197;undergo stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron reduction coupled two hydrogen transfer to form E&#8208;diaminoalkenes; and (b)&#8197;have non identical pathways for reduction and oxidation.







Abstract
This work presents a stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron transfer induced hydrogen shift leading to the conversion of a bis&#8208;pyrrolinium cation to an E&#8208;diaminoalkene and vice versa. Remarkably, the forward and the reverse reaction, which are both reversible, follow two completely different reaction pathways. Establishing such unprecedented property in this type of processes was possible by developing a novel synthetic route towards the starting dication. All intermediates involved in both the forward and the backward reactions were comprehensively characterized by a combination of spectroscopic, crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and theoretical methods. The presented synthetic route opens up new possibilities for the generation of multi&#8208;pyrrolinium cation scaffold&#8208;based organic redox systems, which constitute decidedly sought&#8208;after molecules in contemporary chemistry.
