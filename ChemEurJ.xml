      <title>A Water&#8208;Stable Lanthanide Coordination Polymer as Multicenter Platform for Ratiometric Luminescent Sensing Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Antibiotics detection: A water&#8208;stable coordination polymer (Dy&#8208;TCPB) with multiple emitting centers is applied to distinguish different antibiotics and for ratiometric sensing of nitrofurazone (NFZ) and furazolidone (FZD) with high sensitivity and selectivity. The polymer also shows great recycling ability, so both the synthetic and sensing strategies present a promising approach for the development of low&#8208;cost and effective ratiometric sensors (see scheme).







Abstract
As a hot topic of global concern, the distinguishing and detecting of antibiotic pollution is crucial owing to its adverse effect on ecosystems and human health stemming from excessive use and poor management. Herein, a water&#8208;stable lanthanide coordination polymer sensor (Dy&#8208;TCPB) with multiple emitting centers is prepared. The versatile Dy&#8208;TCPB can conveniently differentiate various antibiotics, and displays a self&#8208;calibration luminescent response to nitrofurazone (NFZ) and furazolidone (FZD). Each antibiotic exhibits notable correlation to a unique combination of the two ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Dy ion emission intensity ratios, enabling two&#8208;dimensional fingerprint recognition. Furthermore, the novel self&#8208;calibration sensor demonstrates effective recognition of NFZ and FZD with excellent sensitivity and selectivity, and detection limits as low as 0.0476 and 0.0482&#8197;&#956;m for NFZ and FZD, respectively. The synthetic approach for the fabrication of a singular coordination polymer exhibiting multiple emissions provides a promising strategy for the development of facile and effective ratiometric sensors.

      <title>Mild Homogeneous Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles through the Epoxide Route: Kinetics, Mechanisms, and Related One&#8208;Pot Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Homogeneous alkalinization leads to the quantitative formation of gold nanoparticles at room temperature by means of epoxide ring&#8208;opening. The new methodology takes advantage of the kinetically controlled generation of OH&#8722; in the reaction medium; under alkaline conditions spheroidal Au nanoparticles are formed. The required stabilizing agents affect the mechanism of growth and kinetics, as demonstrated by spectroscopic measurements.







Abstract
A new one&#8208;pot homogeneous methodology at room temperature to obtain Au nanoparticles (AuNP) on the basis of the epoxide route is presented. The proposed method takes advantage of the homogenous generation of OH&#8722; moieties driven by epoxide ring&#8208;opening, mediated by chloride nucleophilic attack. Once reached alkaline conditions, the reducing medium allows the quantitative formation of AuNP under well&#8208;defined kinetic control. A stabilizing agent, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), is required to maintain the AuNP stable. Meanwhile their presence dramatically affects the reduction kinetics and pathway, as demonstrated by the evolution of the UV/Vis spectra, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) patterns, and pH value along the reaction. In the presence of PVP nanogold spheroids are obtained following a similar reduction mechanism as that observed for control experiments in the absence of PVP. However, if CTAC is employed a stable complex with AuIII is formed, leading to a different reaction pathway and resulting in ellipsoidal&#8208;like shaped AuNP. Moreover, the proposed methodology allows stabilize the growing AuNP, by coupling their formation with nonalkoxidic sol&#8211;gel reactions, leading to nanocomposite gels with embedded metallic nanoparticles. The epoxide route thus offers a versatile scenario for the one&#8208;pot preparation of new metal nanoparticles&#8211;inorganic/hybrid matrices nanocomposites with valuable optical properties.

      <title>Exciplex Formation and Electromer Blocking for Highly Efficient Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence OLEDs with All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
The molecular engineering of the TADF emitter has been successfully used to enable the fabrication of fully solution&#8208;processed blue OLEDs. The excellent device efficiency with a high EQE above 20&#8201;% can be attributed to the efficient exciplex formation and electromer blocking (see figure).







Abstract
Highly efficient solution&#8208;processable emitters are greatly desired to develop low&#8208;cost organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The recently developed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials are promising candidates, but blue TADF materials compatible with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;process have still not been achieved. Here, a series of TADF materials, named X&#8208;4CzCN, are developed by introducing the bulky units through an unconjugated linker, which realizes high molecular weight to enhance the solvent resistance ability without disturbing the blue TADF feature. Meanwhile, the peripheral wrapping groups efficiently inhibit the triplet&#8211;triplet and triplet&#8211;polaron quenching by isolating the energy&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;transporting channels. The photophysical measurements indicate that a small variation in peripheral unit will have a noticeable effect on the luminescence efficiency. The enlarged volume of peripheral units will make the electroluminescent spectra blueshift, while enhancing the energy transfer of exciplex and blocking the energy leakage of electromer can facilitate the exciton utilization. As a result, the fully solution&#8208;processed blue OLED achieves a CIE of (0.16, 0.27), a low turn on voltage of 2.9&#8197;eV, and a high external quantum efficiency of 20.6&#8201;%. As far as we known, this is the first report of all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs with blue emission, which exhibits a high efficiency even comparable to the vacuum&#8208;deposited devices.

As a result, the fully solution&#8208;processed blue OLED achieves a CIE of (0.16, 0.27), a low turn on voltage of 2.9&#8197;eV, and a high external quantum efficiency of 20.6&#8201;%. As far as we known, this is the first report of all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs with blue emission, which exhibits a high efficiency even comparable to the vacuum&#8208;deposited devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macromolecular Isomerism in Giant Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Macromolecular isomerism has been a largely understudied phenomenon. Giant molecules provide an ideal platform for such studies and should help illustrate the structure&#8211;property relationships as well as the delicate influence of structural factors on the assembly.







Abstract
Macromolecular isomerism has been an important yet largely understudied subject. Giant molecules based on molecular nanoparticles exhibit properties highly dependent on the primary structures, providing a platform for such studies. Various isomers have been designed, synthesized and characterized, including sequence&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and topo&#8208;isomers. The self&#8208;assembly of these isomers is influenced by the distinct symmetry and collective interaction of each building block in a subtle and delicate way. The results suggest that isomerism may be exploited as a new way for fine&#8208;tuning the structures and properties of macromolecules, which should be of great interest in both fundamental research and technical innovation.

      <title>Dual Metastability in Electroless Plating: Complex Inertness Enabling the Deposition of Composition&#8208;Tunable Platinum Copper Alloy Nanostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Walking two fine lines at once: Adding kinetically inert PtIV complexes to CuII&#8208;formaldehyde solutions results in systems metastable with respect to both platinum coordination and metal reduction, enabling the autocatalytic, highly conformal deposition of alloy nanofilms, in which the additional synthetic degree of freedom provided by the sluggish ligand exchange is translated to compositional control (see figure).







Abstract
Autocatalytic deposition represents a facile, versatile, and scalable wet&#8208;chemical tool for nanofabrication. However, the intricate component interplay in plating baths containing multiple metal species impedes alloy deposition. We resolved this challenge in the bimetallic copper&#8208;platinum system by exploiting the kinetic stability of platinum complexes, which allows adjusting their ligand sphere and thus reactivity independently from the present copper ions in a preceding, thermally activated ligand exchange step. By using metastable PtIV precursors of varying degrees of complexation, copper&#8208;platinum alloys of adjustable atomic ratio were plated from solutions of identical composition and concentration, but differing local coordination environment. Due to its excellent conformity and nanoscale homogeneity, the reaction is compatible with ambitious 3D substrate morphologies, as demonstrated in the template&#8208;assisted fabrication of nanotubes with high aspect ratio. The ability to generate additional synthetic degrees of freedom by decoupling the metal complex speciation from the solution composition is of large interest for redox&#8208;chemical synthesis techniques, such as electrodeposition or nanoparticle colloid production.

      <title>An Air&#8208;Stable, Neutral Phenothiazinyl Radical with Substantial Radical Stabilization Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Out in the open: An air&#8208;stable phenothiazinyl radical was synthesized and characterized by means of experiments, spectroscopy, and computational investigations. The crystalline dark&#8208;blue compound shows addressable redox activity and represents the first N&#8208;unsubstituted phenothiazine&#8208;based aminyl radical.







Abstract
The vital effect of radical states on the pharmacological activity of phenothiazine&#8208;based drugs has long been speculated. Whereas cationic radicals of N&#8208;substituted phenothiazines show high stability, the respective neutral radicals of N&#8208;unsubstituted phenothiazines have never been isolated. Herein, the 1,9&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N1,N9&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl radical (SQH2.) is described as the first air&#8208;stable, neutral phenothiazinyl free radical. The crystalline dark&#8208;blue species is characterized by means of EPR and UV/Vis/near&#8208;IR spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry, spectro&#8208;electrochemical analysis, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and computational studies. The SQH2. radical stands out from other aminyl radicals by an impressive radical stabilization energy and its parent amine has one of the weakest N&#8722;H bond dissociation energies ever determined. In addition to serving as open&#8208;shell reference in medicinal chemistry, its tridentate binding pocket or hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor ability might enable manifold uses as a redox&#8208;active ligand or proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reagent.

An octaphosphonate biscavitand showed an uncommon entropy&#8208;driven positive cooperativity in the guest binding.

      <dc:description>
The cavities of coordination cages are well known to be able to bind small&#8208;molecule guests and, in some cases, catalyse reactions on bound guests. But it is not always appreciated that catalytic reactivity can be associated with the external surface of coordination cages, as well as the interior cavity.

Spin&#8208;forbidden reactivity of first row transition metal&#8208;oxo species is computationally investigated through both the MECP between the two diabatic reactants and products PESs, and the TS SOC approach which allows to explore a single adiabatic PES by inclusion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Both approaches provide qualitatively and quantitatively similar reactivity pictures. The TS SOC straightforward exploration of a single adiabatic PES can avoid possible pitfalls when tricky diabatic PESs are involved.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;forbidden reactions are frequently encountered when transition metal oxo species are involved, particularly in oxygen transfer reactivity. The computational study of such reactions is challenging, because reactants and products are located on different spin potential energy surfaces (PESs). One possible approach to describe these reactions is the so&#8208;called minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the diabatic reactants and products PESs. Alternatively, inclusion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effects allows to locate a saddle point on a single adiabatic PES (TS SOC). The TS SOC approach is rarely applied because of its high computational cost. Recently evidence for a TS SOC impact on significantly lowering the activation barrier in dioxygen addition to a carbene&#8208;gold(I)&#8208;hydride complex reaction (Chem. Sci. 2016, 7, 7034&#8211;7039) or even on predicting a qualitatively different reaction mechanism in mercury methylation by cobalt corrinoid (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2016, 55, 11503&#8211;11506) has been put forward. Using MECP and TS SOC approaches a systematic analysis is provided here of three prototypical transition metal oxo spin&#8208;forbidden processes to investigate their implications on reactivity. Cycloaddition of ethylene to chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2+C2H4), iron oxide cation insertion into the hydrogen molecule (FeO++H2) and H&#8208;abstraction from toluene by a MnV&#8208;oxo&#8208;porphyrin cation (MnOP(H2O)++C6H5CH3) are case studies. For all these processes the MECP and TS SOC results are compared, which show that the spin&#8208;forbidden reactivity of transition metal oxo species can be safely described by a MECP approach, at least for the first&#8208;row transition metals investigated here, where the spin&#8208;orbit coupling is relatively weak. However, for the Mn&#8208;oxo reactivity, the MECP and TS SOC have been found to be crucial for a correct description of the reaction mechanism. In particular, the TS SOC approach allows to straightforwardly explore detailed features of the adiabatic potential energy surface which in principle could affect the overall reaction rate in cases where the involved diabatic PESs are tricky.

      <title>One Guest or Two? A Crystallographic and Solution Study of Guest Binding in a Cubic Coordination Cage</title>
      <dc:description>
What a bind: Despite solution titrations showing binding of one guest inside the cavity of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage, in the solid&#8208;state many guests (such as coumarin, illustrated) bind as pairs with up to 87&#8201;% of cavity volume being occupied&#8212;amongst the highest packing coefficients known. With this knowledge from crystallography, evidence for formation of H&#8901;G2 species can be found in solution under forcing conditions.







Abstract
A crystallographic investigation of a series of host&#8211;guest complexes in which small&#8208;molecule organic guests occupy the central cavity of an approximately cubic M8L12 coordination cage has revealed some unexpected behaviour. Whilst some guests form 1:1 H&#8901;G complexes as we have seen before, an extensive family of bicyclic guests&#8212;including some substituted coumarins and various saturated analogues&#8212;form 1:2 H&#8901;G2 complexes in the solid state, despite the fact that solution titrations are consistent with 1:1 complex formation, and the combined volume of the pair of guests significantly exceeds the Rebek 55&#177;9&#8201;% packing for optimal guest binding, with packing coefficients of up to 87&#8201;%. Re&#8208;examination of solution titration data for guest binding in two cases showed that, although conventional fluorescence titrations are consistent with 1:1 binding model, alternative forms of analysis&#8212;Job plot and an NMR titration&#8212;at higher concentrations do provide evidence for 1:2 H&#8901;G2 complex formation. The observation of guests binding in pairs in some cases opens new possibilities for altered reactivity of bound guests, and also highlights the recently articulated difficulties associated with determining stoichiometry of supramolecular complexes in solution.

      <title>Development of a Neutral Diketopyrrolopyrrole Phosphine Oxide for the Selective Bioimaging of Mitochondria at the Nanomolar Level</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective mitochondrial imaging by a neutral probe at the nanomolar level is demonstrated employing a rationally designed triphenylphosphine oxide&#8208;bearing diketopyrrolopyrrole.







Abstract
Development of novel bioimaging materials that exhibit organelle specific accumulation continues to be at the forefront of research interests and efforts. Among the various subcellular organelles, mitochondria, which are found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, are of particular interest in relation to their vital function. To date, most molecular probes that target mitochondria utilise delocalised lipophilic cations such as triphenylphosphonium and pyridinium. However, the use of such charged motifs is known to be detrimental to the working function of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and there remains a strong case for development of neutral mitochondrial fluorescent probes. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the exploitation of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based chemistries for the realisation of a neutral fluorescent probe that exhibits organelle specific accumulation within the mitochondria at the nanomolar level. The synthesised probe, which bears a neutral triphenylphosphine oxide moiety, exhibits a large Stokes shift and high fluorescence quantum yield in water, both highly sought&#8208;after properties in the development of bioimaging agents. In vitro studies reveal no interference with cell metabolism when tested for the human MCF7 breast cancer cell and nanomolar subcellular organelle colocalisation with commercially available mitochondrial staining agent Mitotracker Red. In light of its novelty, neutral structure and the preferential accumulation at nanomolar concentrations we anticipate this work to be of significant interest for the increasingly larger community devoted to the realisation of neutral mitochondrial selective systems and more widely to those engaged in the rational development of superior organic architectures in the biological field.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Distorted &#960;&#8208;Extended Chiral Triptycenes Consisting of Three Distinct Aromatic Rings by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of distorted &#960;&#8208;extended chiral triptycenes, consisting of three distinct aromatic rings, has been achieved with high ee value of 87&#8201;% by the rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition followed by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and aromatization. Demethoxy derivatives were also synthesized by the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. In this synthesis, the use of an electron&#8208;deficient diyne and an electron&#8208;rich alkene is crucial to suppress the undesired strain&#8208;relieving carbocation rearrangement and stabilize the distorted triptycene structure (see figure).

Demethoxy derivatives were also synthesized by the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. In this synthesis, the use of the electron&#8208;deficient diyne and the electron&#8208;rich alkene is crucial to suppress the undesired strain&#8208;relieving carbocation rearrangement and stabilize the distorted triptycene structure.

      <title>Front Cover: One Guest or Two? A Crystallographic and Solution Study of Guest Binding in a Cubic Coordination Cage (Chem. Eur. J. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The ability of coordination cages to accommodate guests in their cavities is crucial to functions relating to catalysis, sensing and drug delivery. Consequently, understanding properly the number and type of guests that can bind is essential for development of new functions. In this work we show how a series of guests which apparently give 1:1 H&#8901;G binding in a cage according to titrations performed in dilute solution show, in the solid state, 1:2 H&#8901;G2 complex formation with the pairs of bound guests giving very high packing coefficients (up to 87&#8201;%). More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;D. Ward et&#8197;al. on page 3054.

      <title>Encoding Chiral Molecular Information in Metal Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral metals: Recent achievements and perspectives concerning the development of metal structures encoded with chiral molecular information are summarized and discussed. The synthesis of such materials either by chemical or electrochemical approaches is described. In addition, their potential applications for enantioselective adsorption, chiral separation, and analysis as well as asymmetric synthesis are illustrated.







Abstract
The concept of encoding molecular information in bulk metals has been proposed over the past decade. The structure of various types of molecules, including enantiomers, can be imprinted in achiral substrates. Typically, to encode metals with chiral information, several approaches, based on chemical and electrochemical concepts, can be used. In this Minireview, recent achievements with respect to the development of such materials are discussed, including the entrapment of chiral biomolecules in metals, the chiral imprinting of metals, as well as the combination of imprinting with nanostructuring. The features and potential applications of these designer materials, such as chirooptical properties, enantioselective adsorption and separation, as well as their use for asymmetric synthesis will be presented. This will illustrate that the development of molecularly encoded metal structures opens up very interesting perspectives, especially in the frame of chiral technologies.

      <title>Identification of the Active Catalyst for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Kumada Coupling Reactions of Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>
Nickel catalysis: Evaluation of nickel precatalysts in different oxidation states provided evidence for active Ni0 species in a stereospecific alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction (see scheme).







Abstract
A series of nickel complexes in varying oxidation states were evaluated as precatalysts for the stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of benzylic ethers. These results demonstrate rapid redox reactions of precatalysts, such that the oxidative state of the precatalyst does not dictate the oxidation state of the active catalyst in solution. These data provide the first experimental evidence for a Ni0&#8211;NiII catalytic cycle for a stereospecific alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction, including spectroscopic analysis of the catalyst resting state.

      <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Modulation of Exchange Interaction in a High&#8208;Spin Ground&#8208;State Diradical/Triradical System</title>
      <dc:description>
Higher order exchange coupling: Oxidation of a diradical bis(nitronyl nitroxide)&#8208;substituted diphenyldihydrophenazine introduces an additional electronic spin at the dihydrophenazine core, which results in a cationic quartet ground&#8208;state species with stronger ferromagnetic coupling in comparison with that of the neutral triplet&#8208;state species. Reversible conversion between the two species is confirmed from the electronic spectra acquired during electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
A triplet ground&#8208;state diradical molecule, bis(nitronyl nitroxide)&#8208;substituted diphenyldihydrophenazine (1..), that can be converted into a one&#8208;electron oxidized species, 1&#8230;+, in the quartet ground state has been developed. Surprisingly, these species, 1.. and 1&#8230;+, can be used under ambient conditions because they are reasonably stable under aerobic conditions, even in solution. The temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibilities reveal that 1.. and 1&#8230;+ are in the triplet state, with a weak exchange interaction (J1/kB = +3.1&#8197;K) and quartet ground state with a strong exchange interaction (J2/kB = +160&#8197;K), respectively. The interconversion between the neutral and one&#8208;electron oxidized species can be realized through electrochemical reactions. Significantly different absorption bands in the near&#8208;IR region newly appeared in the electronic spectra acquired during electrochemical oxidation/reduction.

      <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Specific Drug Delivery by a Tumor&#8208;Homing CPP&#8208;Gossypol Conjugate Employing a Tracelessly Cleavable Linker</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective drug delivery: A Cancer&#8208;cell specific drug delivery system was developed by conjugating a tumor homing peptide and gossypol through a cleavable linker. The Schiff's base linked conjugate killed the targeted MCF&#8208;7 cells selectively compared to HeLa cells used as a control (see figure).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery is highly important for improving chemotherapy, as it reduces the dose of cytotoxic agents and minimizes the death of healthy tissues. Towards this goal, a conjugate was synthesized of gossypol and a MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell specific CPP (cell penetrating peptide), thus providing a selective drug delivery system. Utilizing the aldehyde moiety of gossypol, the tumor homing CPP RLYMRYYSPTTRRYG was attached through a semi&#8208;labile imine linker, which was cleaved in a traceless fashion under aqueous conditions and had a half&#8208;life of approximately 10&#8197;hours. The conjugate killed MCF&#8208;7 cells to a significantly greater extent than HeLa cells or healthy fibroblasts.

      <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Cooperativity in the Guest Binding of an Octaphosphonate Bis&#8208;cavitand</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive cooperativity driven by entropy was realized in the guest binding of an octaphosphonate bis&#8208;cavitand. The water molecules form clusterlike assemblies at the two cavities of the bis&#8208;cavitand in chloroform. The desolvation of the water molecules induced by guest binding results in the positive cooperativity (see figure).







Abstract
Uncommon entropy&#8208;driven cooperativity is reported in the guest binding of an octaphosphonate bis&#8208;cavitand. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined the thermodynamic parameters for the 1:2 host&#8211;guest binding of bis&#8208;cavitands with ammonium guests in methanol, ethanol, 2&#8208;propanol, and chloroform. Chloroform drove uncommon entropy&#8208;driven cooperative binding, whereas the alcohols resulted in enthalpy&#8208;driven noncooperative binding. 1H&#8197;NMR studies revealed that each cavity contained six water molecules in chloroform, which were liberated on guest binding. The enthalpy&#8211;entropy compensation relationship produced a large positive intrinsic entropy in chloroform, which implies that water desolvation causes a considerable entropic gain by paying an enthalpic penalty due to breaking the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of the water clusters.

Abstract
A series of twistacene&#8208;functionalized donor (D)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A) derivatives&#8197;(2&#8211;5) have been designed and synthesized, in which twistacene can be regarded as a promising platform for electron&#8208;rich systems for fluorescence emitters.

The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of the arylboron&#8208;modified benzonitrile unit can effectively separate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 4/5, which is beneficial for the formation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules.

      <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Type Pendant Conjugated Molecules Based on a Triazine Center with Depressed Intramolecular Charge Transfer Characteristics as Gain Media for Organic Semiconductor Lasers</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic semiconducting lasers: A set of novel fluorene&#8208;capped pendant conjugated molecules (T&#8208;m and T&#8208;p) were designed, synthesized, and investigated as gain media for organic semiconductor lasers. Varying the capping positions of the fluorene units on the pendant core structures results in significantly different intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties. No clear donor&#8211;acceptor characteristics were observed in T&#8208;m, whereas T&#8208;p exhibited distinct ICT properties according to the experimental results and theoretical calculations. The results demonstrated that selective construction of the pendant conjugated molecules with depressed ICT characteristics helps to achieve robust gain media with excellent optical gain properties and enhanced thermostability and photostability as well as fine&#8208;tuning the electrical behaviors.







Abstract
A set of fluorene&#8208;capped pendant conjugated molecules (T&#8208;m and T&#8208;p), which consist of a triazine center with three carbazole substituents as the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type pendant structure, were designed, synthesized, and investigated as gain media for organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs). In particular, varying the capping positions of the fluorene units on the pendant core structures results in significantly different intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties, where T&#8208;m manifested depressed ICT characteristic and high fluorescence quantum yield. The lowest amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold in neat films was recorded as 1.9&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for T&#8208;m and 83.8&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for T&#8208;p, which indicated that the depressed ICT characteristics in the case of T&#8208;m help to enhance the ASE properties. Remarkably, the ASE threshold remained almost unchanged and the ASE spectra showed very small shifts (within 1&#8197;nm) for T&#8208;m with film samples annealed up to 180&#8201;&#176;C in open air. In contrast, its linear counterpart 2FEtCz&#8208;m showed a clearly increased ASE threshold upon annealing above 100&#8201;&#176;C. The results suggest that the selective construction of conjugated pendant molecules with depressed ICT characteristics is beneficial for finely modulating the optical and electrical properties as well as improving the thermostability and photostability, which manifests the great potential as a robust gain media for OSLs.

      <title>Iron Porphyrin Allows Fast and Selective Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to CO in a Flow Cell</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron porphyrin has been shown to be an exceptionally efficient supported homogeneous catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to CO in water once inserted in a flow cell. From neutral pH to alkaline conditions, selectivities larger than 98&#8201;% were systematically obtained, thanks to the high reactivity of the catalyst with CO2 and the low overpotential values that makes the HER pathway unfavorable.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts have been shown to have high selectivity for CO2 electrochemical reduction to CO, but with current densities significantly below those obtained with solid&#8208;state materials. By depositing a simple Fe porphyrin mixed with carbon black onto a carbon paper support, it was possible to obtain a catalytic material that could be used in a flow cell for fast and selective conversion of CO2 to CO. At neutral pH (7.3) a current density as high as 83.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was obtained with a CO selectivity close to 98&#8201;%. In basic solution (pH&#8197;14), a current density of 27&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was maintained for 24&#8197;h with 99.7&#8201;% selectivity for CO at only 50&#8197;mV overpotential, leading to a record energy efficiency of 71&#8201;%. In addition, a current density for CO production as high as 152&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&gt;98&#8201;% selectivity) was obtained at a low overpotential of 470&#8197;mV, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noble metal based catalysts.

      <title>Microrobots in Brewery: Dual Magnetic/Light&#8208;Powered Hybrid Microrobots for Preventing Microbial Contamination in Beer</title>
      <dc:description>
Hybrid photocatalytic microrobots decorated with magnetic nanoparticles for the autonomous capturing and removal of yeast contamination in beer. This work demonstrates the potential of using externally actuated microrobots as an innovative and low&#8208;cost solution for avoiding yeast spoilage in complex liquid environments, such as alcoholic beverages (see figure).







Abstract
Yeasts play a key role in the production of alcoholic beverages by fermentation processes. However, because of their continuous growth, they commonly cause spoilage of the final product. Herein, we introduce dual magnetic/light&#8208;responsive self&#8208;propelled microrobots that can actively move in a beer sample and capture yeast cells. The presence of magnetic nanoparticles on the surface of the microrobots enables their magnetic actuation under fuel&#8208;free conditions. In addition, their photoactivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation leads to an overall enhancement of their swimming and yeast removal capabilities. It was found that after the application of the microrobots into a real unfiltered beer sample, these micromachines were able to remove almost 100&#8201;% of residual yeasts. In addition, these microrobots could also be added at the initial step of the fermentation process without altering the final beer properties, such as alcohol level, color, and pH. This work demonstrates the potential of using externally actuated microrobots as an innovative and low&#8208;cost solution for avoiding yeast spoilage in complex liquid environments, such as alcoholic beverages. Therefore, these autonomous self&#8208;propelled microrobots open new avenues for future applications in the food industry.

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric N&#8208;Allylation of Amino Acid Esters with Exceptional Levels of Catalyst Control: Stereo&#8208;Divergent Synthesis of ProM&#8208;15 and Related Bicyclic Dipeptide Mimetics</title>
      <dc:description>
Identification of a powerful ligand for the catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;allylation of amino acid esters paved the way for a short and fully stereo&#8208;controlled access to new dipeptide building blocks with a defined 3D structure (see scheme).







Abstract
A general and powerful method for the stereo&#8208;controlled Pd&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;allylation of amino acid esters is reported, as a previously largely unsolved synthetic challenge. Employing a new class of tartaric acid&#8208;derived C2&#8208;symmetric chiral diphosphane ligands the developed asymmetric amination protocol allows the conversion of various amino acid esters to the N&#8208;allylated products with highest levels of enantio&#8208; or diastereoselectivity in a fully catalyst&#8208;controlled fashion and predictable configuration. Remarkably, the in situ generated catalysts also exhibit outstanding levels of activity (ligand acceleration). The usefulness of the method was demonstrated in the stereo&#8208;divergent synthesis of a set of new conformationally defined dipeptide mimetics, which represent new modular building blocks for the development of peptide&#8208;inspired bioactive compounds.

The Chinese character sh&#242;u (&#23551;, or longevity) can be written in more than 100 different ways, which is reminescent of the isomerism phenomena in the molecular world. Compared with small molecules, macromolecular isomerism has been largely understudied.

The results show that the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules is highly sensitive to their primary structures and suggest that isomerism may be exploited as a new way for fine&#8208;tuning the structures and properties of macromolecules.

      <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of distorted chiral triptycenes, consisting of three distinct aromatic rings, has been achieved with high ee value.

      <title>Structural Insight into Binary Protein Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Ferritin Nanocages as Linkers and Nickel Clusters as Nodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by protein symmetry and the high binding affinity of His2 motifs for Ni2+, this work reports a two&#8208;step approach for the fabrication of binary protein&#8211;metal crystalline frameworks bridged by nickel ion clusters.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for numerous applications. However, proteins, carriers of biological functions in living systems, have not yet been fully explored as building blocks for the construction of MOFs. This work presents a strategy for the fabrication of binary MOFs. Considering octahedral ferritin symmetry, four His2 (His&#8211;His) motifs were first incorporated into the exterior surface of a ferritin nanocage near each C4 channel, yielding protein linkers with multiple metal&#8208;binding sites (bisH&#8208;SF). Secondly, by adding nickel ions to bisH&#8208;SF solutions triggers the self&#8208;assembly of ferritin nanocages into a porous 3D crystalline MOF with designed protein lattice, where two adjacent ferritin molecules along the C4 symmetry axes are bridged by four dinuclear or tetranuclear nickel clusters depending on Ni2+ concentration. This work provides a simple approach for precise control over a binary protein&#8211;metal crystalline framework, and the resulting MOFs exhibited inherent ferroxidase activity and peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity.

      <title>Tuning the Fluorescence Through Reorientation of the Axle in Calix[6]arene&#8208;Based Pseudorotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
The binding, in non&#8208;polar media, of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based wheel with a stilbazolium salt yields a mixture of pseudorotaxane orientational isomers whose ratio can be reversibly tuned by changing the temperature. Because of the different environment experienced by the axle in the two isomers, different optical properties are observed, evolving while the equilibrium is displaced during time or by means of temperature.







Abstract
This work describes a calix[6]arene&#8208;based wheel that binds, in non&#8208;polar media, a stilbazolium salt to yield a mixture of pseudorotaxane orientational isomers. The isomer's abundance ratio evolves with time and can be reversibly tuned by adjusting the temperature. The spectroscopic properties, and notably the emission spectrum, of the bound guest depend on its orientation inside the non&#8208;palindromic wheel, suggesting such a system as a switch with spectroscopic readout.

      <title>Improved Photostability of a CuI Complex by Macrocyclization of the Phenanthroline Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Rescue CuI phenanthroline complexes: Like a safety buoy the macrocyclized bisphenanthroline ligand surrounds the CuI ion and improves the complex's photostability, visible&#8208;light absorptivity, and emission compared to an open analogue (see graphic).







Abstract
The development of molecular materials for conversion of solar energy into electricity and fuels is one of the most active research areas, in which the light absorber plays a key role. While copper(I)&#8208;bis(diimine) complexes [CuI(L)2]+ are considered as potent substitutes for [RuII(bpy)3]2+, they exhibit limited structural integrity as ligand loss by substitution can occur. In this article, we present a new concept to stabilize copper bis(phenanthroline) complexes by macrocyclization of the ligands which are preorganized around the CuI ion. Using oxidative Hay acetylene homocoupling conditions, several CuI complexes with varying bridge length were prepared and analyzed. Absorption and emission properties are assessed; rewardingly, the envisioned approach was successful since the flexible 1,4&#8208;butadiyl&#8208;bridged complex does show enhanced MLCT absorption and emission, as well as improved photostability upon irradiation with a blue LED compared to a reference complex.

      <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis for the Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Mixed Disulfide via Sulfur&#8211;Sulfur Bond Metathesis towards Dynamic Disulfide Libraries</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrical and symmetrical: A novel approach of electrolysis using alternating current was applied in the sulfur&#8211;sulfur bond metathesis of symmetrical disulfides towards unsymmetrical disulfides. The highly dynamic nature of this chemistry resulted in the creation of dynamic disulfide libraries by expansion of the matrices, consisting of up to six symmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
A novel approach of electrolysis using alternating current was applied in the sulfur&#8211;sulfur bond metathesis of symmetrical disulfides towards unsymmetrical disulfides. As initially expected, a statistical distribution in disulfides was obtained. Furthermore, the influence of electrode polarisation by alternating current was investigated on a two&#8208;disulfide matrix. The highly dynamic nature of this chemistry resulted in the creation of dynamic disulfide libraries by expansion of the matrices, consisting of up to six symmetrical disulfides. In addition, mixing of matrices and stepwise expanding of a matrix by using alternating current electrolysis were realised.

      <title>Coordination&#8208;Cage&#8208;Catalysed Hydrolysis of Organophosphates: Cavity&#8208; or Surface&#8208;Based?</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic 8&#8208;ball: An octanuclear cubic coordination cage host binds organophosphate guests in the central cavity as the crystal structure of the complex with the insecticide &#8216;dichlorvos&#8217; shows; but catalysed hydrolysis in aqueous solution occurs primarily at the external surface and not in the cavity.







Abstract
The hydrophobic central cavity of a water&#8208;soluble M8L12 cubic coordination cage can accommodate a range of phospho&#8208;diester and phospho&#8208;triester guests such as the insecticide &#8220;dichlorvos&#8221; (2,2&#8208;dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate) and the chemical warfare agent analogue di(isopropyl) chlorophosphate. The accumulation of hydroxide ions around the cationic cage surface due to ion&#8208;pairing in solution generates a high local pH around the cage, resulting in catalysed hydrolysis of the phospho&#8208;triester guests. A series of control experiments unexpectedly demonstrates that&#8212;in marked contrast to previous cases&#8212;it is not necessary for the phospho&#8208;triester substrates to be bound inside the cavity for catalysed hydrolysis to occur. This suggests that catalysis can occur on the exterior surface of the cage as well as the interior surface, with the exterior&#8208;binding catalysis pathway dominating here because of the small binding constants for these phospho&#8208;triester substrates in the cage cavity. These observations suggest that cationic but hydrophobic surfaces could act as quite general catalysts in water by bringing substrates into contact with the surface (via the hydrophobic effect) where there is also a high local concentration of anions (due to ion pairing/electrostatic effects).

&lt;p&gt;The hydrophobic central cavity of a water&#8208;soluble M&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; cubic coordination cage can accommodate a range of phospho&#8208;diester and phospho&#8208;triester guests such as the insecticide &#8220;dichlorvos&#8221; (2,2&#8208;dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate) and the chemical warfare agent analogue di(isopropyl) chlorophosphate. The accumulation of hydroxide ions around the cationic cage surface due to ion&#8208;pairing in solution generates a high local pH around the cage, resulting in catalysed hydrolysis of the phospho&#8208;triester guests. A series of control experiments unexpectedly demonstrates that&#8212;in marked contrast to previous cases&#8212;it is not necessary for the phospho&#8208;triester substrates to be bound inside the cavity for catalysed hydrolysis to occur. This suggests that catalysis can occur on the exterior surface of the cage as well as the interior surface, with the exterior&#8208;binding catalysis pathway dominating here because of the small binding constants for these phospho&#8208;triester substrates in the cage cavity. These observations suggest that cationic but hydrophobic surfaces could act as quite general catalysts in water by bringing substrates into contact with the surface (via the hydrophobic effect) where there is also a high local concentration of anions (due to ion pairing/electrostatic effects).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UV/VIS spectroscopy of Copper Formate Clusters: Insight into Metal&#8208;Ligand Photochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The electronic structure and the photochemistry of copper formate clusters Cu(I)2(HCO2)3&#8211; and Cu(II)n(HCO2)2n+1&#8211;, n&#160;&#8804;&#160;8, are investigated in the gas phase using UV/Vis spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations. A clear difference in the spectra of clusters with Cu(I) and Cu(II) copper ions is observed. For the Cu(I) species, transitions between copper d and s/p orbitals are recorded. For stoichiometric Cu(II) formate clusters, the spectra are dominated by copper d&#8208;d transitions and charge transfer excitations from formate to the vacant copper d orbital. Calculations reveal the existence of several energetically low&#8208;lying isomers, and the energetic position of the electronic transitions depends strongly on the specific isomer. The oxidation state of the copper centers governs the photochemistry. In Cu(II)(HCO2)3&#8211;, fast internal conversion into the electronic ground state is observed, leading to statistical dissociation; for charge transfer excitations, specific excited state reaction channels are observed in addition, like formyl radical loss. In Cu(I)2(HCO2)3&#8211;, the system relaxes to a local minimum on an excited state potential energy surface and might undergo fluorescence or reach a conical intersection to the ground state, in both cases providing substantial energy for statistical decomposition. Alternatively, a Cu(II)(HCO2)3Cu(0)&#8211; biradical structure is formed in the excited state, which gives rise to the photochemical loss of a neutral copper atom.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemistry in the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal oxide thin films by solution methods</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemistry has emerged in the last few years as a powerful tool for the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal oxide thin films prepared by solution methods. Today, its implementation into the fabrication procedure makes possible the integration of amorphous semiconductors or functional crystalline oxides into flexible electronic systems at temperatures below 350 &#186;C. In this review, the effects of UV irradiation at the different stages of the chemical solution deposition of metal oxide thin films are presented. These stages include from the synthesis of the precursor solution to the formation of the amorphous metal&#8208;oxygen network in the film and its subsequent crystallization into the oxide phase. Photochemical reactions that can be induced in both the solution deposited layer and the irradiation atmosphere are first described, highlighting the role of the potential reactive chemical species formed in the system under irradiation, such as free radicals or oxidizing compounds. Then, the photochemical effects of continuous UV light on the film are shown, focusing on the decomposition of the metal precursors, the condensation and densification of the metal&#8208;oxygen network, and the nucleation and growth of the crystalline oxide. All these processes are demonstrated to advance the formation and crystallization of the metal oxide thin film to an earlier stage, which is ultimately translated into a lower temperature range of fabrication. The reduced energy consumption of the process upon decreasing the processing temperature, and the prospect of using light instead of heat in the synthesis of inorganic materials, make photochemistry as a promising technique for a sustainable future ever more needed in our life.</dc:description>

      <title>Scholl&#8208;Type Cycloheptatriene Ring Closure of 1,4,9,12&#8208;Tetraarylfenestrindanes: Reactivity and Selectivity in the Construction of Fenestrane&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Saddles</title>
      <dc:description>
Saddle up! The reactivity of thirteen symmetrical and two unsymmetrical tetraarylfenestrindanes towards fourfold Scholl&#8208;type heptagonal ring closure to generate the corresponding saddle&#8208;shaped derivatives was examined, with six new successful examples. The reaction mechanism and the observed selectivity of the twofold cyclization were also investigated by both experiments and DFT calculations (DDQ=dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone).







Abstract
The Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation, generating up to four cycloheptatriene rings around a fenestrindane core, leads to novel, saddle&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbon derivatives. In this article, we present the results of in&#8208;depth experimental and computational work on the oxidative cyclization of various 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes. In particular, the kinetic control of the four&#8208;step cyclization of the electronically activated tetrakis(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) derivative is elucidated. The reasons for the exclusive emergence of one single among the three possible doubly cyclized intermediates and for the nonappearance of the singly and triply cyclized intermediates are clarified. In addition, the origin of the concomitant bridgehead hydroxylation is studied. The reactivity of a set of fifteen symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes towards Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation is presented, pinpointing the structural factors that underlie this reaction and demonstrating the potential and limitations of this synthetic approach. A particularly surprising finding of this study is that the electronically nonactivated 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraphenylfenestrindane can also undergo the fourfold Scholl&#8208;type cyclization process and can be transformed into the parent saddle hydrocarbon.

      <title>Novel fluorescently labelled ATP analogues for direct monitoring of ubiquitin activation</title>
      <dc:description>Simple and robust assays to monitor enzymatic ATP cleavage with high efficiency in real&#8208;time are scarce. To address this shortcoming, we developed novel fluorescently labelled adenosine tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and pentaphosphate analogues of ATP. The novel ATP analogues bear &#8211; in contrast to earlier reports &#8211; only a single acridone&#8208;based dye at the terminal phosphate group. The dye&#8217;s fluorescence is quenched by the adenine component of the ATP analogue and is restored upon cleavage of the phosphate chain and dissociation of the dye from the adenosine moiety. Thereby the activity of ATP cleaving enzymes can be followed in real&#8208;time. We demonstrate this proficiency for ubiquitin activation by the ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzymes UBA1 and UBA6 which represents the first step in an enzymatic cascade leading to the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, a process that is highly conserved from yeast to humans. We found that the efficiency to serve as cofactor for UBA1/UBA6 very much depends on the length of the phosphate chain of the ATP analogue: triphosphates are used poorly while pentaphosphates are most efficiently processed. Notably, the novel pentaphosphate&#8208;harbouring ATP analogue supersedes the efficiency of recently reported dual&#8208;dye labelled analogues and thus, is a promising candidate for broad applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Pseudo&#8208;Isocyanine Chloride as a Sensor for Macromolecular Crowding in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;isocyanine chloride (PIC) is a dyestuff which self&#8208;assembles in aqueous solution, thereby showing a characteristic and sharp absorption band as well as a fluorescence band at a wavelength of 573 nm. Based on this unique feature, a synthetic model system was developed, suitable to analyse self&#8208;assembly in various environments like macromolecular crowding. First, Triethylene glycol (TEG), polyethylene glycol (PEG), Ficoll 400 as a highly branched polysaccharide and sucrose corresponding to the monomeric unit of Ficoll were used as potential crowders. Combined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and time&#8208;resolved light scattering revealed a strong impact of crowding based on excluded volume effects only for Ficoll 400. Sucrose had hardly any influence on the self&#8208;assembly of PIC and PEG and TEG impeded the PIC self&#8208;assembly. Finally, HeLa cells were infiltrated with PIC solutions well below the aggregation threshold in the infiltrating solution. In the cellular environment, PIC was exposed to a significant crowding and immediately started to aggregate. As was demonstrated by fluorescence imaging, the extent of aggregation could be modulated by exposing the cells to salt&#8208;induced osmotic stress. The results suggest future use of such a system as a sensor for the analysis of in vitro and in vivo crowding effects on self&#8208;assembly processes.</dc:description>

As was demonstrated by fluorescence imaging, the extent of aggregation could be modulated by exposing the cells to salt&#8208;induced osmotic stress. The results suggest future use of such a system as a sensor for the analysis of in vitro and in vivo crowding effects on self&#8208;assembly processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The change in reduction potential and significant increase in current density demonstrates that the hybrid core&#8208;shell NRs possess remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared to NRs of ZnO alone.</dc:description>

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Generation of Benzynes from Phenols: Formation of Primary Anilines by the Deoxyamination of Phenols</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct and selective: Benzynes have been selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.







Abstract
Benzynes were selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. The direct conversion of a phenolic hydroxyl group into a free amino group is a useful method for the preparation of primary aryl amines that are hard to synthesize by using coupling reactions involving phenol derivatives with ammonia. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.

      <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;LDHs have been deemed as a benchmark non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, for NiFe&#8208;LDHs laminate, the edge sites are active, but the basal plane is inert, leading to underutilization for the OER catalysts. Herein, it is the first time to intercalate the light and electron&#8208;deficient Li ion into NiFe&#8208;LDHs basal plane. The results of theoretical calculation and experiment both showed that the electron would transfer from near Ni  2+  to the surrounding of Li  +  , resulting in the electron&#8208;deficient properties of Ni site would work as &#8220;electron&#8208;hungry&#8221; sites to enhance surface adsorption of electron&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing group, which would benefit to enhance the effective active for OER. Demonstrated with catalytic performance, the Li&#8208;NiFe&#8208;LDHs electrodes showed ultralow overpotential only 298 mV at 50 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which was lower than that of 347 mV for initial NiFe&#8208;LDHs, and also lower than that of 373 mV for RuO  2  .

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f = 2.9 vs 0.02%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced&#160;fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Alkynyls with Microsecond Lifetimes Bearing a Strong&#8208;Field Pincer Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>The use of organometallic triplet emitters in OLEDs is motivated by the premise of efficient intersystem crossing leading to unit internal quantum efficiencies. However, since most devices are based on solid&#8208;state components, an inherent limitation to square planar platinum(II) phosphors is their tendency toward aggregation&#8208;based quenching. &#160;We introduce a new class of emissive, four&#8208;coordinate Pt(II) species based on the bisimidazolyl carbazolide (BIMCA) ligand that display highly efficient, long&#8208;lived solid&#8208;state phosphorescence at room temperature. As examples, a set of four BIMCAPt phenyl acetylides are synthesized that emit in the green (l  max  = 507&#8208;540 nm) with &gt;60% quantum yield and millisecond lifetimes. The structures of the resulting species reveal a non&#8208;planar structure imposed by steric clashes between BIMCA and the iodo or alkynyl coligand. Ground&#8208;state and photophysical characterization are presented. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate that the BIMCA ligand dominates the frontier orbitals along with the first Franck&#8208;Condon singlet and triplet excited states.</dc:description>

      <title>Optically triggered control of the charge carrier density  in chemically functionalized graphene field effect transistors</title>
      <dc:description>Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules. The azobenzene molecules were incorporated to the GFET channel by building a van der Waals heterostructure with a carbon nanomembrane (CNM), which is used as a molecular interposer to attach the azobenzene molecules. Under exposure with 365 nm and 455 nm light, azobenzene molecules undergo  cis  and  trans  molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment. Thus, the effective electric field acting on the GFET channel is tuned by optical stimulation and the carrier density is modulated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
N,N&#8242;&#8208;Ethylene bridged bis&#8208;2&#8208;aryl pyrrolinium cations are reported in this work, which (a)&#8197;undergo stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron reduction coupled two hydrogen transfer to form E&#8208;diaminoalkenes; and (b)&#8197;have non identical pathways for reduction and oxidation.







Abstract
This work presents a stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron transfer induced hydrogen shift leading to the conversion of a bis&#8208;pyrrolinium cation to an E&#8208;diaminoalkene and vice versa. Remarkably, the forward and the reverse reaction, which are both reversible, follow two completely different reaction pathways. Establishing such unprecedented property in this type of processes was possible by developing a novel synthetic route towards the starting dication. All intermediates involved in both the forward and the backward reactions were comprehensively characterized by a combination of spectroscopic, crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and theoretical methods. The presented synthetic route opens up new possibilities for the generation of multi&#8208;pyrrolinium cation scaffold&#8208;based organic redox systems, which constitute decidedly sought&#8208;after molecules in contemporary chemistry.

      <title>Interception of Elusive Cationic Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn Heterobimetallic Adducts with Mixed Alkyl Bridges Featuring Multiple Agostic Interactions</title>

To bond to natural terrains, animals employ diverse adaptions: prehensile tails, suction&#8208;cup toes, zygodactyl claws. Molecular bonding can also be nuanced; unraveling such mysteries is at the heart of chemistry. A series of Hf/Al, Hf/Zn complexes is bound by multiple agostic interactions from bridging alkyls and has short Hf&#8211;Al/Zn interatomic distances. One can envision agostic hydrogen atoms grasping the Hf center like toes, the electron cloud of Al/Zn brushing against it like a tail.

      <title>Luminescence&#8208;Driven Electronic Structure Determination in a Textbook Dimeric DyIII&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
      <dc:description>
Shine on: A dysprosium dinuclear complex textbook example is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of crystal field theory. This historical theory coupled with Boltzmann population allows the extraction of the energy spectrum of the ground state multiplet from luminescence that is used to model the magnetic properties.







Abstract
A textbook dysprosium dinuclear complex based on acetylacetone ligands, [Dy2(acac)4(&#956;2&#8208;acac)2(H2O)2], has been synthesized and fully characterized. This simple dimeric lanthanide complex shows well&#8208;resolved solid&#8208;state luminescence and behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet under zero DC field. A seminal crystal&#8208;field approach is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of an energetic picture.

In this study, inspired by these recent insights regarding the LbL SURMOF growth mechanism, we investigated the impact of reactant solutions concentration on LbL growth of the Cu2(F4bdc)2 (dabco) SURMOF (F4bdc2&#8208; = tetrafluorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate and dabco = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octane) in situ using quartz&#8208;crystal microbalance and ex situ with a combination of spectroscopic, diffraction and microscopy techniques. It was found that number, size and morphology of MOF crystallites are strongly influenced by the reagent concentration.

      <title>Control over the Aspect Ratio of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Recent developments in kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization permit control of the size (length and area) of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. However, control of molecular self&#8208;assembly at a level comparable with organic synthetic chemistry and the achievement of structural complexity at a hierarchy larger than the molecular level remain challenging. In this study, we focus on controlling the aspect ratio of supramolecular nanosheets. A systematic understanding of the relationship between the monomer structure and the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape has derived a new monomer capable of forming supramolecular nanosheets.

      <title>Functionalization of Piperidine Derivatives for the Site&#8208;Selective and Stereoselective Synthesis of Positional Analogues of Methylphenidate</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention, please: Regio, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 functionalization on piperidine ring controlled by catalysts and protecting groups has been employed for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate (Ritalin).







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertions and cyclopropanations of donor/acceptor carbenes have been used for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate. The site selectivity is controlled by the catalyst and the amine protecting group. C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TCPTAD)4, or N&#8208;brosyl&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TPPTTL)4 generated 2&#8208;substitited analogues. In contrast, when N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;oxoarylacetyl&#8208;piperidines were used in combination with Rh2(S&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;BrTPCP)4, the C&#8722;H functionalization produced 4&#8208;susbstiuted analogues. Finally, the 3&#8208;substituted analogues were prepared indirectly by cyclopropanation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;tetrahydropyridine followed by reductive regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanes.

      <title>Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalyzed by Ru Nanocatalysts: Labelling of Complex Molecules Containing N&#8208;Heterocycles and Reaction Mechanism Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D2 or T2 gas as isotopic sources. In terms of application, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms allows the synthesis of deuterated internal standards for LC/MS quantification and the efficacy of the catalytic process permits the preparation of complex radiolabelled drugs owning high specific activities by using a subatmospheric pressure of T2 gas.







Abstract
Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D2 or T2 gas as isotopic sources. Depending on the substructure considered, this approach does not only represent a significant step forward in practice, with notably higher isotope uptakes, a broader substrate scope and a higher solvent applicability compared to existing procedures, but also the unique way to label important heterocycles using hydrogen isotope exchange. In terms of applications, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms, allows the synthesis of internal standards for LC&#8208;MS quantification. Moreover, the efficacy of the catalyst permits, even under subatmospheric pressure of T2 gas, the preparation of complex radiolabeled drugs owning high molar activities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ruthenium nanocatalysis&lt;/b&gt; can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas as isotopic sources. In terms of application, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms allows the synthesis of deuterated internal standards for LC/MS quantification and the efficacy of the catalytic process permits the preparation of complex radiolabelled drugs owning high specific activities by using a subatmospheric pressure of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas as isotopic sources. Depending on the substructure considered, this approach does not only represent a significant step forward in practice, with notably higher isotope uptakes, a broader substrate scope and a higher solvent applicability compared to existing procedures, but also the unique way to label important heterocycles using hydrogen isotope exchange. In terms of applications, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms, allows the synthesis of internal standards for LC&#8208;MS quantification. Moreover, the efficacy of the catalyst permits, even under subatmospheric pressure of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, the preparation of complex radiolabeled drugs owning high molar activities. From a fundamental point of view, a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic study identifying undisclosed key intermediates, allowed a deeper understanding of C&#8722;H (and N&#8722;H) activation processes occurring at the surface of metallic nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Radical C&#8722;N Borylation of Aromatic Amines Enabled by a Pyrylium Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>
A radical borylation of aromatic amines through a homolytic C(sp2)&#8722;N bond cleavage is presented. This method capitalizes on a simple and mild activation via a pyrylium reagent (ScPyry&#8208;OTf) that primes the amino group for reactivity. The combination of terpyridine and a diboron reagent triggers a radical reaction which cleaves the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond and forges a new C(sp2)&#8722;B bond. The non&#8208;planar structure of the pyridinium, provides the necessary driving force for the challenging aryl radical formation.

      <title>Optical Control of Cytokine Production Using Photoswitchable Galactosylceramides</title>
      <dc:description>
A new direction in photoimmunotherapy: The synthesis and biological evaluation of photochromic derivatives of the &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide KRN&#8208;7000 are reported. The photolipid &#945;&#8208;GalACer&#8208;4 proved to be more potent than KRN&#8208;7000 itself when activated with 370&#8197;nm light (see scheme).







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramides are glycosphingolipids that show promise in cancer immunotherapy. After presentation by CD1d, they activate natural killer T cells (NKT), which results in the production of a variety of pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of photochromic derivatives of KRN&#8208;7000, the activity of which can be modulated with light. Based on established structure&#8211;activity relationships, we designed photoswitchable analogues of this glycolipid that control the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN&#8208;&#947;. The azobenzene derivative &#945;&#8208;GalACer&#8208;4 proved to be more potent than KRN&#8208;7000 itself when activated with 370&#8197;nm light. Photolipids of this type could improve our mechanistic understanding of cytokine production and could open new directions in photoimmunotherapy.

      <title>Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling between Phenols and &#946;&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Facile Construction of Benzofurans</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrifying: A mild electrochemical system was developed for the preparation of benzofurans through cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This method has good functional&#8208;group compatibility and can serve as a powerful synthetic tool with high synthetic value.







Abstract
Preparative electrochemical synthesis is an ideal method for establishing green, sustainable processes. The major benefits of an electro&#8208;organic strategy over that of conventional chemical synthesis are the avoidance of reagent waste and mild reaction conditions. Here, an intermolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been developed to build various benzofurans under undivided electrolytic conditions. Neither transition metals nor external chemical oxidants are required to facilitate the dehydrogenation and dehydration processes. The key factor in success was the use of nBu4NBF4 as the electrolyte and hexafluoroisopropanol as the solvent, which play key roles in the cyclocondensation step. This electrolysis is scalable and can be used as a key step in drug synthesis. On the basis of several experimental results, the mechanism, particularly of the remarkable anodic oxidation and cyclization process, was illustrated.

      <title>Amino&#8208;Induced 2D Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Aerobic Oxidation of Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure tuning: With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of an o&#8208;amino group, a coordination structure was tuned from a metal&#8211;organic pholyhedron to a 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA, AIA=2&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid) shows high catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of olefins under air atmosphere.







Abstract
With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of the o&#8208;amino group, we have successfully tuned a coordination structure from a metal&#8211;organic polyhedron (MOP) to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups, and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA) has been applied as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the aerobic epoxidation of olefins by using air as oxygen source. Without the aggregation problem of active sites in MOPs, Cu&#8208;AIA possesses much higher reactivity than MOP&#8208;1. Furthermore, the amino group of the framework has been used as a modifiable site through post&#8208;synthetic metalation (PSMet) to prepare a 2D MOF&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalyst, which shows excellent catalytic performance for the Suzuki reaction. It indicates that Cu&#8208;AIA can also work as a good 2D MOF carrier for the derivation of other heterogeneous catalysts.

      <title>Solvent Impact on the Properties of Benchmark Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Synthesis of CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks: CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 were synthesized by utilizing acetonitrile as the solvent. The typical breathing behavior of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 upon guest molecule adsorption was inhibited by a high concentration of defects. As shown by NMR spectroscopy these consist of noncoordinated &#8722;COOH groups. Breathing could be enforced by applying a pressure of about 60&#8197;MPa during mercury intrusion.







Abstract
Herein is reported the utilization of acetonitrile as a new solvent for the synthesis of the three significantly different benchmark metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 of idealized composition [Al(OH)(ISO)], [Ce6O4(OH)4(BDC)6], and [Al(OH)(BDC)], respectively (ISO2&#8722;: isophthalate, BDC2&#8722;: terephthalate). Its use allowed the synthesis of Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 on a gram scale. While CAU&#8208;10 and Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 exhibit properties similar to those reported elsewhere for these two materials, the obtained Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 shows no structural flexibility upon adsorption of hydrophilic or hydrophobic guest molecules such as water and xenon and is stabilized in its large&#8208;pore form over a broad temperature range (130&#8211;450&#8197;K). The stabilization of the large&#8208;pore form of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 was attributed to a high percentage of noncoordinating &#8722;COOH groups as determined by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The defective material shows an unusually high water uptake of 310&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the range of 0.45 to 0.65&#8197;p/p&#176;. In spite of showing no breathing effect upon water adsorption it exhibits distinct mechanical properties. Thus, mercury intrusion porosimetry studies revealed that the solid can be reversibly forced to breathe by applying moderate pressures (&#8776;60&#8197;MPa).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks&lt;/b&gt;: CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 were synthesized by utilizing acetonitrile as the solvent. The typical breathing behavior of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 upon guest molecule adsorption was inhibited by a high concentration of defects. As shown by NMR spectroscopy these consist of noncoordinated &#8722;COOH groups. Breathing could be enforced by applying a pressure of about 60&#8197;MPa during mercury intrusion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein is reported the utilization of acetonitrile as a new solvent for the synthesis of the three significantly different benchmark metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 of idealized composition [Al(OH)(ISO)], [Ce&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(BDC)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], and [Al(OH)(BDC)], respectively (ISO&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;: isophthalate, BDC&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;: terephthalate). Its use allowed the synthesis of Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 on a gram scale. While CAU&#8208;10 and Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 exhibit properties similar to those reported elsewhere for these two materials, the obtained Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 shows no structural flexibility upon adsorption of hydrophilic or hydrophobic guest molecules such as water and xenon and is stabilized in its large&#8208;pore form over a broad temperature range (130&#8211;450&#8197;K). The stabilization of the large&#8208;pore form of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 was attributed to a high percentage of noncoordinating &#8722;COOH groups as determined by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The defective material shows an unusually high water uptake of 310&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; within the range of 0.45 to 0.65&#8197;p/p&#176;. In spite of showing no breathing effect upon water adsorption it exhibits distinct mechanical properties. Thus, mercury intrusion porosimetry studies revealed that the solid can be reversibly forced to breathe by applying moderate pressures (&#8776;60&#8197;MPa).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural Investigation of Hybrid Peptide Foldamers Composed of &#945;&#8208;Dipeptide Equivalent &#946;&#8208;Oxy&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
Peptide mimics: Conformational properties of peptides composed of new &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids are studied as dipeptide surrogates both in solution and as single crystals. Structural analysis suggests that the &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids can be accommodated into helices without significant deviation in the overall helical folding (see figure).







Abstract
Due to their equivalent lengths, &#948;&#8208;amino acids can serve as surrogates of &#945;&#8208;dipeptides. However, &#948;&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains have not been well studied because of synthetic difficulties and because of their insolubility in organic solvents. Recently we reported the spontaneous supramolecular gelation of &#948;&#8208;peptides composed of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. Here, we report the incorporation of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids as guests into the host &#945;&#8208;helix, &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide 12&#8208;helix and their single&#8208;crystal conformations. In addition, we studied the solution conformations of hybrid peptides composed of 1:1 alternating &#945; and &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. In contrast to the control &#945;&#8208;helix structures, the crystal structure of peptides with &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids exhibit &#945;&#8208;helical conformations consisting of both 13&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered H&#8208;bonds. The &#945;,&#948;&#8208;hybrid peptide adopted mixed 13/11&#8208;helix conformation in solution with alternating H&#8208;bond directionality. Crystal&#8208;structure analysis revealed that the &#945;,&#947;4&#8208;hybrid peptide accommodated the guest &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acid without significant deviation to the overall helix folding. The results reported here emphasize that &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains can be accommodated into regular &#945;&#8208;helix or 12&#8208;helix as guests without much deviation of the overall helix folding of the peptides.

      <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red Electrophosphorescent Iridium(III) Complexes Based on Optimizing Ancillary Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Mind the gap: A HOMO energy&#8208;level regulation strategy of modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligand is proposed with the aim of developing pure&#8208;red emission materials, with spectra mainly covering the region from &#955;=600 to 700&#8197;nm. High external quantum efficiencies are achieved with an exciplex cohost.







Abstract
Two new iridium(III) complexes were synthesized by introducing two trifluoromethyl groups into an ancillary ligand to develop pure&#8208;red emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligands is suppressed, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups, which can reduce the HOMO energy levels compared with those of compounds without trifluoromethyl groups. However, the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into the ancillary ligand has little impact on the LUMO energy levels. Therefore, a well&#8208;tuned, pure&#8208;red, excited&#8208;state energy was achieved by regulating the relative energy level between the HOMO and LUMO. OLEDs with these complexes as emitters showed high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26&#8201;% and realized high EQEs of about 25&#8201;% and fairly low driving voltages of 3.3&#8211;3.6&#8197;V for practical luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, as well as excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.66, 0.33) and (0.67, 0.33); thus, this demonstrates the successful molecular design strategy by modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of ancillary ligand.

      <dc:description>
Magic bullet: In this minireview, recent advances in the field of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for cancer therapeutic applications are highlighted, including those for drug delivery, phototherapy, and combined therapy.







Abstract
As newly emerged crystalline porous materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess fascinating structures and some specific features such as modularity, crystallinity, porosity, stability, versatility, and biocompatibility. Besides adsorption/separation, sensing, catalysis, and energy applications, COFs have recently shown a promise in biomedical applications. This contribution provides an overview of the recent developments of COF&#8208;based medicines in cancer therapeutics, including drug delivery, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and combined therapy. Furthermore, the major challenges and developing trends in this field are also discussed. These recent developments are summarized and discussed to help encourage further contributions in this emerging and promising field.

      <title>Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides</title>
      <dc:description>
Competition time: Anions, gases and solvents present in chemical reactions compete with ligands for metal coordination sites. Coordinating ability indices (CAI) rank such species according to their affinity to three families of metals: transition metals, lanthanides and s&#8208;block metals. After a brief review of recent applications to a variety of fields (synthesis, catalysis, nanochemistry, electrochemistry.), a new extended set of CAI is presented and discussed.







Abstract
After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s&#8208;block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)&#8197;the charge of an anion, (b)&#8197;the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)&#8197;the degree of protonation of oxo&#8208;anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)&#8197;the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes. Hit parades of solvents and anions most commonly used in the areas of transition metal, s&#8208;block and lanthanide chemistry are deduced from the statistics of their presence in crystal structures.

      <title>Is There a Single Ideal Parameter for Halogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Based Lewis Acidity?</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspecting halogen bonding: Is it possible to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strength accurately by a single DFT calculation and achieve better performance than that offered by the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth?







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bond donors (halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids) have now found various applications in diverse fields of chemistry.

      <title>Gas&#8211;Solid Heterogeneous Postsynthetic Modification of Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Click! Postsynthetic functionalization of imine&#8208;based COFs is carried out at the solid&#8211;gas (COF&#8211;azide) interface, without solvent and catalyst, in high yield. This procedure is a green postsynthetic modification of COFs and allows for the preparation of 2D materials with high potential for the development of new applications.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reaction is among the most extensively used strategies for the post&#8208;polymerization modification of COFs. This work shows a new procedure for the postsynthetic functionalization of imine&#8208;based COFs by using a heterogeneous solid&#8211;gas reaction between alkyne&#8208;functionalized COFs and azides in the absence of a copper catalyst. This new alternative represents a step forward towards a greener postsynthetic modification of COFs opening a high potential for the development of new applications.

      <title>Cyclometalated Ruthenium Pincer Complexes as Catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones with Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkylation with ruthenium: Eight new Ru pincer complexes were prepared by introduction of C,N&#8208;bound phenyl heterocycle ligands. These complexes were applied as catalysts in the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols through hydrogen autotransfer. Here, superior yields in comparison to [RuHCl(CO)(HN(CH2CH2PPh2)2)] (Ru&#8208;MACHO) were achieved and 21 different alkylated ketones were synthesized in up to 97&#8201;% yield. Moreover, investigations regarding the catalyst species present during the reaction were conducted.







Abstract
Ruthenium PNP pincer complexes bearing supplementary cyclometalated C,N&#8208;bound ligands have been prepared and fully characterized for the first time. By replacing CO and H&#8722; as ancillary ligands in such complexes, additional electronic and steric modifications of this topical class of catalysts are possible. The advantages of the new catalysts are demonstrated in the general &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols following a hydrogen autotransfer protocol. Herein, various aliphatic and benzylic alcohols were applied as green alkylating agents for ketones bearing aromatic, heteroaromatic or aliphatic substituents as well as cyclic ones. Mechanistic investigations revealed that during catalysis, Ru carboxylate complexes are predominantly formed whereas neither the PNP nor the CN ligand are released from the catalyst in significant amounts.

      <title>Metallation&#8208;Induced Heterogeneous Dynamics of DNA Revealed by Single&#8208;Molecule FRET</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic complexity: The metallation of DNA by an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex is studied using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), revealing dynamic heterogeneity that is obscured at the ensemble level.







Abstract
The metallation of nucleic acids is key to wide&#8208;ranging applications, from anticancer medicine to nanomaterials, yet there is a lack of understanding of the molecular&#8208;level effects of metallation. Here, we apply single&#8208;molecule fluorescence methods to study the reaction of an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex and DNA. Individual metallated DNA hairpins are characterised using F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although ensemble measurements suggest a simple two&#8208;state system, single&#8208;molecule experiments reveal an underlying heterogeneity in the oligonucleotide dynamics, attributable to different degrees of metallation of the GC&#8208;rich hairpin stem. Metallated hairpins display fast two&#8208;state transitions with a two&#8208;fold increase in the opening rate to &#8776;2&#8197;s&#8722;1, relative to the unmodified hairpin, and relatively static conformations with long&#8208;lived open (and closed) states of 5 to &#8805;50&#8197;s. These studies show that a single&#8208;molecule approach can provide new insight into metallation&#8208;induced changes in DNA structure and dynamics.

      <title>Synthesis of the 8,19&#8208;Epoxysteroid Eurysterol&#8197;A</title>
      <dc:description>
From an animal sterol to a bioactive marine natural product: The first synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal sulfated sterol with a unique 8,19&#8208;epoxy bridge spanning ring&#8197;B, was elaborated exploiting an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report the first chemical synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal marine steroidal sulfate with a unique C8&#8722;C19 oxy&#8208;bridged cholestane skeleton. After C19 hydroxylation of cholesteryl acetate, used as an inexpensive commercial starting material, the challenging oxidative functionalization of ring&#8197;B was achieved by two different routes to set up a 5&#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one moiety. As a key step, an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was exploited to close the oxy&#8208;bridge (8&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy unit). DFT calculations show this reversible transformation being exergonic by about &#8722;30&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Along the optimized (scalable) synthetic sequence, the target natural product was obtained in only 11&#8197;steps in 5&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, an access to (isomeric) 7&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy steroids with a previously unknown pentacyclic ring system was discovered.

      <title>Tetraammineplatinum(II) and Tetraamminepalladium(II) Chromates as Precursors of Metal Oxide Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and the thermal decomposition mechanisms of precursors in different atmospheres were studied. The catalytic properties of bimetallic Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 were compared with those of monometallic Pt and Pd in CO total oxidation and preferential oxidation in excess hydrogen processes.







Abstract
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and characterized by a number of physicochemical methods of analysis (IR, single&#8208;crystal and powder XRD, and simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry with evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry). Thermolysis of the salts obtained in a hydrogen atmosphere proceeds with the partial reduction of chromium to a metallic state and the formation of MxCr1&#8722;x (M=Pt, Pd) metal solid solution with a chromium content of up to 22&#8197;at&#8201;% and chromium(III) oxide. The thermal decomposition of salts in an inert and oxidizing atmosphere passes through the formation stage of the MCrO2 phase with the delafossite structure followed by its subsequent decomposition into chromium(III) oxide and noble metal. Nanosized Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 composites obtained by the thermolysis of precursor salts in air at 500&#8201;&#176;C and being held at this temperature for 1&#8197;h showed a high catalytic activity in the CO total oxidation (TOX) and preferential oxidation in the excess of hydrogen (PROX) processes compared with that of monometallic Pt and Pd powders.

      <title>Increasing Complexity: A Practical Synthetic Approach to Three&#8208;Dimensional, Cyclic Sulfoximines and First Insights into Their in Vitro Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Practical and safe: An underrepresented structural motif in the life sciences is now accessible by a practical and safe synthetic approach. Five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in two to three steps in high yields and broad scope (17 examples). In vitro evaluation of properties relevant to medicinal chemistry of these three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for drug discovery.







Abstract
A short synthetic approach with broad scope to access five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines in only two to three steps from readily available thiophenols is reported. Thus, simple building blocks were converted to complex molecular structures by a sequence of S&#8208;alkylation and one&#8208;pot sulfoximine formation, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Seventeen structurally diverse cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in high overall yields. In vitro evaluation of these underrepresented, three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines with respect to properties relevant to medicinal chemistry did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for application in drug discovery.

      <title>Thermal decomposition of ternary sodium graphite intercalation compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Detailed comparisons of in situ temperature dependent XRD with TGA&#8208;MS and Raman measurements reveals a series of dynamic transformations during heating. Surprisingly, the bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene sheets. The heating process drives a reorganisation of the solvent and Na molecules, then an evaporation of the solvent; however, the solvent loss is arrested by restacking of the graphene layers, leading to trapped solvent bubbles.

      <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Carbon&#8208;Bound Boron Difluoride Hydrazone Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>The creation of dimeric boron difluoride complexes of chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is a proven strategy for the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of fluorescent dyes. We report dimers based on the boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) framework, which offer unique and sometimes unexpected substituent&#8208;dependent absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties.

      <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the crystal phase dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures were synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step colloidal method, and the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor exhibited much improved sensing performance due to the formation of p&#8211;n hetero&#8208;junctions.







Abstract
The formation of semiconductor heterostructures is an effective approach to achieve high performance in electrical gas sensing. However, such heterostructures are usually prepared via multi&#8208;step procedures. In this contribution, by taking advantage of the crystal phase&#8208;dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, we report a one&#8208;step colloid method for the preparation of SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures, with x &#8776;30, 50, and 70. The obtained materials with solution processability were successfully fabricated into NO2 sensors. Among them, the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor with an active layer thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m exhibited the highest sensitivity to NO2 (30&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;ppm) with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 69&#8197;ppb at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). This was mainly attributed to the formation of p&#8211;n junctions that allowed for gas&#8208;induced modification of the junction barriers. Under 405&#8197;nm laser illumination, the sensor performance was further enhanced, exhibiting a 3.5&#8197;times increased response toward 0.1&#8197;ppm NO2, along with a recovery time of 4.6&#8197;min.

      <title>Exciton Interactions, Excimer Formation, and [2&#960;+2&#960;] Photodimerization in Nonconjugated Curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Folding chromophores: A series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes has been synthesized. The compounds display solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission as a result of a folding process controlling intramolecular chromophore aggregation. An in&#8208;depth investigation of their photophysical properties allowed a complex kinetic scheme to be established and provided a rationale for the formation of the first example of photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of a series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes and the detailed investigation of their solvent&#8208;dependent spectroscopic and photophysical properties. In solvents of low polarity, intramolecular folding induces the formation of aggregated chromophores, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of which display the optical signature characteristic of weakly&#8208;coupled H&#8208;aggregates. The extent of folding and, in turn, of ground&#8208;state aggregation is strongly dependent on the nature of the flexible linker. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopies show that the Frenkel exciton relaxes into a fluorescent symmetrical excimer state with a long lifetime. Furthermore, our in&#8208;depth studies show that a weakly emitting excimer lies on the pathway toward a photocyclomer. Two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) allowed the structure of the photoproduct to be established. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a [2&#960;+2&#960;] photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.

      <title>Bimodal Heterogeneous Functionality in Redox&#8208;Active Conjugated Microporous Polymer toward Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional catalyst: Bimodal functionality toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photochemical H2 evolution of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) is explored. Tuning of the side&#8208;chain substitutions on oligo&#8208;(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene bola&#8208;amphiphilic struts shows distinct nanostructuring in CMPs, which has a high impact on catalytic performances.







Abstract
The designing and development of heterogeneous catalysts for conversion of renewable energy to chemical energies by electrochemical as well as photochemical processes is at the forefront of energy research. In this work, two new donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;mix and TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;gly) are synthesized through Schiff base condensation reaction using a microwave synthesizer. Notably, the asymmetric and symmetric bola&#8208;amphiphilic nature of the OPE struts results in distinct nanostructuring and morphologies in the CMPs. Interestingly, both CMPs show impressive heterogeneous catalytic activity toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions, and therefore, act as bimodal electro&#8208; and photocatalytic porous organic materials. Furthermore, the redox&#8208;active property of the CMPs is exploited for in&#8197;situ generation and stabilization of platinum nanoparticles (Pt), and these Pt@CMPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.

In this work, two new donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;mix and TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;gly) are synthesized through Schiff base condensation reaction using a microwave synthesizer. Notably, the asymmetric and symmetric bola&#8208;amphiphilic nature of the OPE struts results in distinct nanostructuring and morphologies in the CMPs. Interestingly, both CMPs show impressive heterogeneous catalytic activity toward electrochemical O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution reactions, and therefore, act as bimodal electro&#8208; and photocatalytic porous organic materials. Furthermore, the redox&#8208;active property of the CMPs is exploited for in&#8197;situ generation and stabilization of platinum nanoparticles (Pt), and these Pt@CMPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Defect Engineering of Two&#8208;dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS  2  ) holds great promise in electronic and optoelectronic applications owing to its unique structure and intriguing properties. The intrinsic defects such as sulfur vacancies (SVs) of MoS  2  nanosheets are found to be detrimental to the device efficiency. To mitigate this problem, functionalization of 2D MoS  2  using thiols has emerged as one of the key strategies for engineering defects. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to controllably engineer the SVs of chemically&#8208;exfoliated MoS  2  nanosheets using a series of substituted thiophenols in solution. The degree of functionalization can be tuned by varying the electron withdrawing strength of substituents in thiophenols. We find that the intensity of 2LA(M) peak normalized to A  1g  peak strongly correlates to the degree of functionalization. Our results provide a spectroscopic indicator to monitor and quantify the defect engineering process. This method of MoS  2  defect functionalization in solution also benefits the further exploration of defect&#8208;free MoS  2  for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Construction of a [16]&#8208;Imidazolium Cage via a Quadruple [2+2] Photocycloaddition and Its Selective Fluorescent Recognition of Pyranine (HPTS)</title>
      <dc:description>Polyimidazolium&#8208;based cages are considered promising materials based on their fascinating properties and potential applications. These three&#8208;dimensional functional structures are highly desirable for the recognition of particular guest molecules, however, their synthesis remains challenging. In this work, we have designed and synthesizes a pure [n]&#8208;imidazolium (n = 16) cage, the hexadecakisimidazolium salt H16&#8208;2(PF6)16, from tetragonal octakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;1(PF6)8. The synthetic method involves formation of metal&#8208;carbene templates, a quadruple photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition reaction and subsequent removal of metal ions. Specifically, the synthesized cage, featuring sixteen imidazolium moieties, demonstrated high efficiency for the selective fluorescent recognition of 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;pyrene trisulfonate (HPTS).&#160;The present work not only further develops the metal&#8208;carbene template strategy by exploiting a new type of polyimidazolium cage, but also provides encouraging prospects for the design of versatile imidazolium&#8208;based functional acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Emission from Precious Metal&#8208;Free Luminophores Consisting of C, H, O, Si, and S/P at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Ratiometric sensors: Dual emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence with comparable intensities is achieved with 1,4&#8208;disiloxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(acceptor)benzenes, in which arylsulfonyl and diarylphosphinyl groups are installed as acceptors.

Abstract
Fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emissive compounds are valuable tools for ratiometric luminescence sensing. Herein, it is reported that 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;bis[bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphinyl]&#8208;1,4&#8208;disiloxybenzenes exhibit dual emission with emission peaks that were easily identified without performing time&#8208;gated measurement. The disiloxybenzenes in powder simultaneously fluoresced and phosphoresced at 358&#8211;374 and 457&#8211;470&#8197;nm, respectively, under vacuum. The intensity ratios of the phosphorescence/fluorescence maxima of the disiloxybenzenes in powder and in a thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate) were sensitive to temperature and molecular oxygen, respectively. The plots of the relative intensity versus temperature or partial pressure of molecular oxygen were well fitted with calibration curves defined by an exponential approximation with excellent correlation coefficients R2 (0.9708&#8211;0.9921), demonstrating the high potential of the disiloxybenzenes as precious metal&#8208;free probes applicable to ratiometric luminescence sensing.

      <title>Carbon&#8211;Phosphorus Coupling from C^N Cyclometalated AuIII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Go for P: C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes were discovered to readily react with phosphines under mild conditions to afford phosphoniums. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and DFT calculations provide insight into this rare AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
With the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report here on the AuIII&#8208;mediated Caryl&#8722;P bond formation occurring upon reaction of C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes with phosphines. The [Au(C^N)Cl2] complex&#8197;1 featuring the bidentate 2&#8208;benzoylpyridine (CCON) scaffold was found to react with PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) under mild conditions, including in water, to afford the corresponding phosphonium&#8197;5 through C&#8722;P reductive elimination. A mechanism is proposed for the title reaction based on in situ 31P{1H} NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS analyses combined with DFT calculations. The C&#8722;P coupling has been generalized to other C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes and other tertiary phosphines. Overall, this work provides new insights into the reactivity of cyclometalated AuIII compounds and establishes initial structure&#8211;activity relationships to develop AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go for P&lt;/b&gt;: C^N cyclometalated Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were discovered to readily react with phosphines under mild conditions to afford phosphoniums. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and DFT calculations provide insight into this rare Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report here on the Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;mediated C&lt;sub&gt;aryl&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;P bond formation occurring upon reaction of C^N cyclometalated Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with phosphines. The [Au(C^N)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; featuring the bidentate 2&#8208;benzoylpyridine (C&lt;sup&gt;CO&lt;/sup&gt;N) scaffold was found to react with PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) under mild conditions, including in water, to afford the corresponding phosphonium&#8197;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; through C&#8722;P reductive elimination. A mechanism is proposed for the title reaction based on in situ &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P{&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H} NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS analyses combined with DFT calculations. The C&#8722;P coupling has been generalized to other C^N cyclometalated Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes and other tertiary phosphines. Overall, this work provides new insights into the reactivity of cyclometalated Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; compounds and establishes initial structure&#8211;activity relationships to develop Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Imide&#8208;Fused Diazatetracenes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Add the imide: A series of imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes were synthesized by Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8722;N coupling. Their optical and electronic properties as well as solid&#8208;state structures were investigated. Further application in perovskite solar cells also illustrated the electron&#8208;transporting properties of our imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes (see figure).







Abstract
A series of imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#8722;N coupling with a highly active palladium source. The introduction of an imide segment effectively lowers the LUMO levels compared with that of unsubstituted diazatetracene. By adjusting the alkyl chains of the diazatetracenes, different solid&#8208;state packings were achieved, resulting in distinct photoluminescent behaviors. Their electron&#8208;transporting properties were demonstrated in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Perovskite solar cells as electron transporting layers.

      <dc:description>
Stable and separable atropisomers of meso tetra(N&#8208;mesyl pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin were synthesized. Other N&#8208;protection groups (tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), carboxybenzyl (Cbz), and Tosyl (Ts)) were explored in the &#8216;all&#8208;pyrrolic porphyrins&#8217; synthesis, but only a mixture of inseparable atropisomers were obtained.







Abstract
Atropisomerism has been observed in a variety of biaryl compounds and meso&#8208;aryl substituted porphyrins. However, in porphyrins, this phenomenon had been shown only with o&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;membered aromatic groups at the meso&#8208;position. We show herein that a 5&#8208;membered heteroaromatic (N&#8208;mesyl&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) group at the meso&#8208;position leads to atropisomerism. In addition, we report a &#8216;one&#8208;pot&#8217; synthetic route for the synthesis of &#8216;all&#8208;pyrrolic&#8217; porphyrin (APP) with several N&#8208;protection groups (Boc, Cbz, Ms and Ts). Among these groups, we found that only the Ms group gave four individually separable atropisomers of meso&#8208;tetra(N&#8208;Ms&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin. Furthermore, the reductive removal of Cbz&#8208; was achieved to obtain meso&#8208;tetra(pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin. Thus, our synthetic procedure provides an easy access to a group of APPs and stable atropisomers, which is expected to expand the application of novel APP&#8208;based materials.

      <title>Synthesis and Systematic Structural Analysis of Cationic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ruthenium Chalcogenocarbonyl Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium Half&#8208;Sandwiches: The synthesis and properties of a series of cationic chalcogenocarbonyl complexes of the type [CpRu(CE)(H2IMes)(CNCH2Ts)][BArF4] (H2IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; E=O, S, Se, Te) are reported herein. This series includes very rare examples of selenocarbonyl (CSe) and tellurocarbonyl (CTe) complexes of Ru&#8722;Cp fragments. The &#960;&#8208;acidic nature of the CE ligands increases upon descending the main group, and the stereochemical stability of the obtained chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal CE complexes is very high.







Abstract
Although the chemistry of transition&#8208;metal complexes with carbonyl (CO) and thiocarbonyl (CS) ligands has been well developed, their heavier analogues, namely selenocarbonyl (CSe) and tellurocarbonyl (CTe) complexes remain scarce. The limited availability of such CSe and CTe complexes has so far hampered our understanding of the differences between such chalcogenocarbonyl (CE: E=O, S, Se, Te) ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of a series of cationic half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium CE complexes of the type [CpRu(CE)(H2IMes)(CNCH2Ts)][BArF4] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5&#8722;; H2IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). A combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR spectroscopic analyses, and DFT calculations revealed an increasing &#960;&#8208;accepting ability of the CE ligands in the order O&lt;S&lt;Se&lt;Te. A variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis of the thus obtained chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal CE complexes indicated high stereochemical stability.

      <title>Interception of Elusive Cationic Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn Heterobimetallic Adducts with Mixed Alkyl Bridges Featuring Multiple Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Weak but important: NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies reveal that weak agostic interactions play a central role in the stabilization of elusive Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn heterobimetallic complexes featuring inequivalent bridging alkyl groups, which are important species for several catalytic processes of industrial relevance.







Abstract
Heterobimetallic complexes with inequivalent bridging alkyl chains are very often invoked as key intermediates in many catalytic processes, yet their interception and structural characterization are lacking. Such complexes have been prepared from reactions of the cationic cyclometalated hafnocene [CpPrCp
Hf][B(C6F5)4] (1) with main group metal alkyls to afford the corresponding hetero&#8208;bridged cationic products, [CpPrCp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;R)E(R)n][B(C6F5)4] (E=Al or Zn; R=Me, Et, or iBu).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weak but important&lt;/b&gt;: NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies reveal that weak agostic interactions play a central role in the stabilization of elusive Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn heterobimetallic complexes featuring inequivalent bridging alkyl groups, which are important species for several catalytic processes of industrial relevance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterobimetallic complexes with inequivalent bridging alkyl chains are very often invoked as key intermediates in many catalytic processes, yet their interception and structural characterization are lacking. Such complexes have been prepared from reactions of the cationic cyclometalated hafnocene [Cp&lt;sup&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;Cp
Hf][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with main group metal alkyls to afford the corresponding hetero&#8208;bridged cationic products, [Cp&lt;sup&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;Cp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;R)E(R)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (E=Al or Zn; R=Me, Et, or &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Bu). NMR and DFT studies demonstrate that both bridging alkyls establish agostic interactions with Hf, which are appreciably stronger for ethyl rather than methyl groups. Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn distances are surprisingly short and only slightly longer than computed Hf&#8211;Al or Hf&#8211;Zn single bond lengths (2.80&#8197;&#197;). Finally, a reaction of [Cp&lt;sup&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;Cp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;Me)Zn(Me)][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] with excess ZnMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields an unprecedented heterotrimetallic species, [(Cp&lt;sup&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hf(&#956;&#8208;Me)(ZnMe)(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)ZnMe][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], the detailed structure of which is elucidated by a combination of NMR spectroscopic methods and molecular calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Azobenzene Isomerization&#8208;Induced Photomodulation of Electronic Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoswitches: The photoinduced trans&#8594;cis isomerization can alter the electron&#8208;donating abilities of azobenzene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Appropriate iridium&#8208;complex (see Figure) was synthesized and utilized to calculate Tolman Electronic Parameter (TEP) to provide the extent of alteration.







Abstract
Azobenzene&#8208;based protonated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(azobenzene)imidazolium chlorides (IAz&#8208;X&#8901;HCl; X=OMe, Br, H) were successfully synthesized and switching abilities of the attached azobenzene units along with the concomitant photoinduced generation of geometric isomers were studied. Upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV light, a p&#8208;methoxy&#8208;azobenzene derivative get transformed from all&#8208;trans isomer to nearly all&#8208;cis isomer at the photostationary state. The extent of photomodulation of electronic properties in the NHC ring of the p&#8208;methoxy&#8208;azobenzene derivative is determined through the Tolman Electronic Parameter (TEP). Iridium complex, [(IAz&#8208;OMe)IrCl(CO)2] was synthesized and infrared spectra were recorded in dichloromethane solution as film in NaCl crystals and by drop&#8208;casting in an ATR crystal. Comparison in averaged carbonyl stretching frequency between all&#8208;trans isomer (

) and all&#8208;cis isomer (

) indicates a significant decrement of &#916;tt&#8211;cc
av=2.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (film) and 3.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (ATR). Therefore, moderate to excellent enhancement of electron density (&#916;tt&#8211;cc TEP=2.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 [film] and 3.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 [ATR]) at the C&#8208;2 position of the NHC is achieved through trans&#8594;cis isomerization of the remotely placed azobenzene units. This fine phototuning of electron&#8208;donating ability at the catalytic center would pave the way to control NHC/NHC&#8208;metal catalyzed organic transformations through external stimuli.

      <title>Catechol Thioesters: Ligands for Hierarchically Formed Lithium&#8208;Bridged Titanium(IV) Helicates and Helicate&#8208;Based Switches</title>
      <dc:description>
Titanium springs: Titanium (IV) triscatechol thioester complexes form in the presence of lithium cations dinuclear helicates, showing a monomer&#8211;dimer equilibrium with dimerization tendencies lying between those of the corresponding ketones and oxoesters. Based on this principle, it is possible to obtain a switchable spring&#8208;type helicate which shows some spontaneous expansion in [D6]DMSO.







Abstract
The thioester moiety is introduced as a lithium binding unit for the hierarchical formation of titanium(IV) catecholate&#8208;based lithium&#8208;bridged helicates. In solution, the coordination compounds show a monomer&#8211;dimer equilibrium which &#8212;in comparison to the oxo esters&#8212; is significantly shifted towards the monomers. In addition, the influence of the thioester side chain on the dimerization behavior is investigated and an expansible/compressible molecular switch is synthesized. In the latter case expansion and compression are performed reversibly in methanol, whereas in DMSO spontaneous expansion occurs.

      <title>Late&#8208;Stage 18O Labeling of Primary Sulfonamides via a Degradation&#8211;Reconstruction Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>
A late&#8208;stage 18O labeling approach of sulfonamides that employs the corresponding unlabeled molecule as the starting material was developed.

Abstract
A late&#8208;stage 18O labeling approach of sulfonamides that employs the corresponding unlabeled molecule as the starting material was developed. Upon deamination of the sulfonamide, a sulfinate intermediate was isotopically enriched using eco&#8208;friendly reagents H218O and 15NH3(aq) to afford a M+5 isotopologue of the parent compound. This degradation&#8211;reconstruction approach afforded isolated yields of up to 96&#8201;% for the stable isotope labeled (SIL) sulfonamides, and was compatible with multiple marketed therapeutics, including celecoxib, on a gram scale. The SIL products also exhibited no 18O/16O back exchange under extreme conditions, further validating the utility of this green strategy for drug labeling for both in vitro and in vivo use. This procedure was also adapted to include pharmaceutically relevant methyl sulfones by using 13CH3, affording M+5 isotopic enrichment, thereby illustrating the broad utility of this methodology.

      <title>Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Dehydrogenation&#8208;Dehydrocoupling: An Atom Economical Access to Alkynylboranes</title>
      <dc:description>
A tandem made for two: An efficient synthesis of alkynylaminoborane was developed using a magnesium catalyst at room temperature. The reaction proceeds within few minutes in high yields releasing hydrogen through a tandem dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling original mechanism between terminal alkynes and boranes.







Abstract
Owing to the unusual reactivity of sterically hindered amine&#8211;borane complexes, a catalytic system based on magnesium salts was designed to perform a tandem dehydrogenation&#8211;dehydrocoupling between terminal alkynes and boranes. The reaction is providing pure alkynylboranes within few minutes at room temperature, with only two molecules of hydrogen as a byproduct.

      <title>Cp*RuCl&#8208;Vinyl Carbenes: Two Faces and the Bifunctional Role in Catalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>Ruthenium vinyl carbenes derived from Cp/Cp*RuCl&#8208;based complexes have been routinely invoked as key intermediates in tandem reactions involving a carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM). A priori, these intermediates resemble the Grubbs&#8208;type family of catalysts, but they exhibit a completely different reactivity pattern that few, if any, other catalytic system can reproduce so far. The reactivity of these species with &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;substituted alkynals showcases the peculiarities of these intermediates. While Z&#8208;vinyl dihydrooxazines are preferentially obtained with the former, Z&#8208;vinyl epoxypyrrolidines are obtained with the latter.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium vinyl carbenes derived from Cp/Cp*RuCl&#8208;based complexes have been routinely invoked as key intermediates in tandem reactions involving a carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM). A priori, these intermediates resemble the Grubbs&#8208;type family of catalysts, but they exhibit a completely different reactivity pattern that few, if any, other catalytic system can reproduce so far. The reactivity of these species with &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;substituted alkynals showcases the peculiarities of these intermediates. While Z&#8208;vinyl dihydrooxazines are preferentially obtained with the former, Z&#8208;vinyl epoxypyrrolidines are obtained with the latter. A combination of spectroscopic and computational data now prove that a &#951;3&#8208;coordination mode of the ruthenium vinyl carbene and the presence of a Lewis basic chloride ligand give rise to two markedly different stereoelectronic faces that are responsible for the unconventional reactivity of these species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tandem Acid/Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Rearrangement of Glycol Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Easy to handle: Glycol derivatives are rearranged under the catalysis of sulfonic acids and subsequently reduced by a unique Pd/diphosphine (dtbpx=&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene) catalyst system with formic acid as transfer reductant. A [1,2] hydrogen shift leading to the subsequent formation of an aldehyde was identified as key step of the transformation, and a PdII&#8211;hydride complex is assumed as active hydrogenation catalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the acid/Pd&#8208;tandem&#8208;catalyzed transformation of glycol derivatives into terminal formic esters. Mechanistic investigations show that the substrate undergoes rearrangement to an aldehyde under [1,2] hydrogen migration and cleavage of an oxygen&#8208;based leaving group. The leaving group is trapped as its formic ester, and the aldehyde is reduced and subsequently esterified to a formate. Whereas the rearrangement to the aldehyde is catalyzed by sulfonic acids, the reduction step requires a unique catalyst system comprising a PdII or Pd0 precursor in loadings as low as 0.75&#8197;mol&#8201;% and &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene as ligand. The reduction step makes use of formic acid as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reductant. The substrate scope of the transformation encompasses both aromatic and aliphatic substrates and a variety of leaving groups.

      <title>Use of Dithiasuccinoyl&#8208;Caged Amines Enables COS/H2S Release Lacking Electrophilic Byproducts
</title>
      <dc:description>
No more electrophilic byproducts! The use of dithiasuccinoyl (DTS)&#8208;caged amines provides access to COS&#8208;based H2S donors that can be activated in the presence of biological thiols including cysteine and reduced glutathione to generate two equivalents of COS/H2S and release an amine&#8208;based payload. These donor compounds provide researchers with chemical tools to further probe the role of reactive sulfur species in biology.







Abstract
The enzymatic conversion of carbonyl sulfide (COS) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by carbonic anhydrase has been used to develop self&#8208;immolating thiocarbamates as COS&#8208;based H2S donors to further elucidate the impact of reactive sulfur species in biology. The high modularity of this approach has provided a library of COS&#8208;based H2S donors that can be activated by specific stimuli. A common limitation, however, is that many such donors result in the formation of an electrophilic quinone methide byproduct during donor activation. As a mild alternative, we demonstrate here that dithiasuccinoyl groups can function as COS/H2S donor motifs, and that these groups release two equivalents of COS/H2S and uncage an amine payload under physiologically relevant conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate that COS/H2S release from this donor motif can be altered by electronic modulation and alkyl substitution. These insights are further supported by DFT investigations, which reveal that aryl and alkyl thiocarbamates release COS with significantly different activation energies.

These insights are further supported by DFT investigations, which reveal that aryl and alkyl thiocarbamates release COS with significantly different activation energies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In a Quest for Selectivity Paired with Activity: A Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalyst Bearing an Unsymmetrical Phenanthrene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective, but still active! A ruthenium catalyst containing phenanthrene&#8208;based unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand has been synthesized. Its anomalous reactivity at 40&#8201;&#176;C contrasts known N&#8208;benzyl Hoveyda&#8208;type complexes that need high temperatures to operate. Simultaneously, it keeps high selectivity towards olefin metathesis products (see graphic).







Abstract
Robust, selective, and stable in the presence of ethylene, ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst, {[3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9&#8208;phenanthryl)]&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinylidene}dichloro(o&#8208;isopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium(II), Ru&#8208;3, bearing an unsymetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (uNHC) ligand, has been synthesized. The initiation rate of Ru&#8208;3 was examined by ring&#8208;closing metathesis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions with a broad spectrum of olefins, showing an unprecendented selectivity. It was also tested in industrially relevant ethenolysis reactions of olefinic substrates from renewable feedstock with very good yields and selectivities.

      <title>Luminescent Anion Sensing by Transition Metal Dipyridylbenzene Complexes Incorporated into Acyclic, Macrocyclic and Interlocked Hosts</title>
      <dc:description>A series of novel acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared via incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of platinum (II) and ruthenium (II). Both the acyclic and macrocyclic derivatives  7&#183;Pt  ,  7&#183;Ru&#183;PF  6  , 10&#183;Pt  and  10&#183;Ru&#183;PF  6  are effective sensors for a range of halides and oxoanions. The near&#8208;infrared emitting&#160;ruthenium congeners exhibited an increased binding strength compared to platinum due to the cationic charge and thus additional electrostatic interactions. Intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between the dipyridylbenzene ligand and the amide carbonyls increases the preorganisation of both acyclic and macrocyclic metal derivatives resulting in no discernible macrocyclic effect. Interlocked analogues were also prepared, and preliminary luminescent chloride anion spectrometric titrations with  12&#183;Ru&#183;(PF  6  )  2  demonstrate a marked increase in halide binding affinity due to the complementary chloride binding pocket of the [2]rotaxane.  1  H NMR binding titrations indicate the interlocked dicationic receptor is capable of chloride recognition even in competitive 30% aqueous mixtures.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A comprehensive model to describe water stability of prototypal metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by combining different types of theoretical and experimental approaches is derived.

      <title>Giant Single&#8208;Crystal Shape Transformation with Wide Thermal Hysteresis Actuated by Synergistic Motions of Molecular Cations and Anions</title>
      <dc:description>Manipulating the collective molecular movements to implement macroscopic mechanical response of bulk material is attractive and challenging. Here, we synthesize an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid single crystal that exhibits a giant macroscopic shape transformation with a remarkable thermal hysteretic feature. The colossal anisotropic shape change, which manifests as an abrupt elongation of ca. 9% along crystallographic c&#8208;axis and a concomitant contraction of ca. 9% in a perpendicular direction, is induced by a significant reorientation of imidazoliums accompanied with a substantial configurational variation in CuBr  4  2&#8722;  complex anions. The synergistic motions of both the molecular cations and anions engender a remarkable large thermal hysteresis (&gt; 30 K) in the shape transformation of single crystal, implying this material may play a role in alternating memory media. Furthermore, due to the stable crystal lattice, a single crystal that demonstrates naked&#8208;eye detectable large shape transformation was used as a thermal actuator to spontaneously control an electric circuit by temperature variation.</dc:description>

      <title>A Silane&#8208;based Bipolar Host with High Triplet Energy for High Efficiency Deep&#8208;Blue Phosphorescent OLEDs with Improved Device Lifetime</title>
      <dc:description>A high triplet energy host is developed using silane moiety. 9&#8208;(4&#8208;(triphenylsilyl)dibenzo[b,d]furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (SiDBFCz) is designed through extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain appropriate hole and electron injection barriers. The chemical hardness and the charge transport characteristics are comprehensively investigated to realize a bipolar host with high triplet energy over 2.9 eV for deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The synthesized SiDBFCz clearly exhibits the bipolar characteristics especially with emitter molecules doped. An external quantum efficiency over 19% without any microcavity optimization is achieved thanks to the good charge balance in the SiDBFCz PHOLED. The device lifetime of the SiDBFCz PHOLED is improved more than 1000%, compared to the unipolar control devices at an initial luminance of 500 cd/m  2  . The dramatic enhancement of the operational stability of the deep blue PHOLED is also thoroughly investigated in terms of electrochemical stability of host molecules in charged or excited states. The results clearly indicate that the device lifetime is strongly correlated with the bond dissociation energy and the activation energy for the bond dissociation reaction in triplet excited state.</dc:description>

      <title>A fast, low temperature synthesis method for hexagonal YMnO3: Kinetics, purity, size and shape as studied by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction mechanisms, phase development and kinetics of the hydrothermal synthesis of hexagonal&#8208;YMnO3 from Y2O3 and Mn2O3 using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction are reported under different reaction conditions with temperatures ranging from 300 to 350 &#176;C, and using 1, 5 and 10 M KOH, and 5 M NaOH mineraliser. Reactions initiated with Y2O3 hydrating to Y(OH)3, which then dehydrated to YO(OH). Higher temperature and KOH concentration led to faster, more complete dehydrations. However, 1 M KOH led to YO(OH) forming concurrently with Y(OH)3 before Y(OH)3 fully dehydrated, but yielded a very low phase purity of hexagonal&#8208;YMnO3. Using NaOH mineraliser, no YO(OH) was observed. Dehydration also initiated at a higher temperature in the absence of Mn2O3. The evolution of Rietveld refined scale factors was used to determine kinetic information and approximate activation energies for the reaction. The described hydrothermal synthesis offers a fast, low temperature method for producing anisometric h&#8208;YMnO3 particles.</dc:description>

Herein, we reported a modular AND gate controlled delivery platform for tumor microenvironment specific activation of therapeutic protein activity based on biomineralization of molecular glue adhered protein enzyme. The AND gate integrates the specific microenvironment of tumor tissues (acidic pH and a certain concentration of ATP) as inputs and activates the therapeutic activity of protein only when both inputs are active.

      <title>Dynamic Coordination Chemistry of Fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs: Synthetic Control and Reassembly/Disassembly beyond de novo Synthesis to Tune the Structure and Property</title>
      <dc:description>Known for excellent stability, porosity and functionality, the high&#8208;valent Zr4+ metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) still meets synthetic challenge in modulating the strength of Zr&#8208;Ocarboxylate linkage.

Comprehensive factors, including ligand geometry, Zr6&#8208;cluster connectivity, acid modulator and reaction temperature/concentration, have been studied for controllable syntheses.

This work sheds light on the understanding of the dynamic coordination chemistry of Zr&#8208;MOFs beyond strong Zr&#8208;O bond, which poses a versatile platform for modification and functionalization of Zr&#8208;MOFs.</dc:description>

A new strategy for activity&#8208;based probes is reported to address the members of the proteome that target &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine posttranslational modifications, which are highly prevalent and constitute a continuously expanding collection of chemical groups.

Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are important in the regulation of protein function, trafficking, localization, and marking for degradation. This work describes the development of peptide activity/affinity&#8208;based probes for the discovery of proteins that recognize novel acyl&#8208;based PTMs on lysine residues in the proteome. The probes contain surrogates of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine by introduction of either hydrazide or thioamide functionalities to circumvent hydrolysis of the modification during the experiments. In addition to the modified PTMs, the developed chemotypes were analyzed with respect to the effect of peptide sequence. The photo cross&#8208;linking conditions and subsequent functionalization of the covalent adducts were systematically optimized by applying fluorophore labeling and gel electrophoresis (in&#8208;gel fluorescence measurements). Finally, selected probes, containing the &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;glutaryllysine and &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;myristoyllysine analogues, were successfully applied for the enrichment of native, endogenous proteins from cell lysate, recapitulating the expected interactions of SIRT5 and SIRT2, respectively. Interestingly, the latter mentioned was able to pull down two different splice variants of SIRT2, which has not been achieved with a covalent probe before. Based on this elaborate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we expect that the technology will have broad future applications for pairing of novel PTMs with the proteins that target them in the cell.

      <title>Asymmetric Catalytic [4+5] Annulation of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides with Vinylethylene Carbonates and its Extension to Stereoselective Tandem Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>
Asymmetric annulation: With the development of a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+5] annulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with vinylethylene carbonates (VECs), an unprecedented tandem rearrangement reaction featuring a unique asymmetric aromatic Claisen rearrangement is described.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+5] annulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with substituted vinylethylene carbonates (VECs) is described for the first time, giving a novel enantioselective approach to chiral nine&#8208;membered benzoheterocycles. Based on this designed [4+5] annulation, an unprecedented silica gel&#8208;promoted tandem rearrangement reaction featuring a unique asymmetric aromatic Claisen rearrangement is explored at room temperature, offering a new method for asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters embedded in chiral functionalized homoallylic alcohols.

      <title>Overcoming Crystallinity Limitations of Aluminium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by Oxalic Acid Modulated Synthesis
</title>
      <dc:description>
The chelation of aluminium ions by oxalic acid enables a versatile modulation action, drastically increasing crystal size without undesired framework modifications.







Abstract
A modulated synthesis approach based on the chelating properties of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) is presented as a robust and versatile method to achieve highly crystalline Al&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. A comparative study on this method and the already established modulation by hydrofluoric acid was conducted using MIL&#8208;53 as test system. The superior performance of oxalic acid modulation in terms of crystallinity and absence of undesired impurities is explained by assessing the coordination modes of the two modulators and the structural features of the product. The validity of our approach was confirmed for a diverse set of Al&#8208;MOFs, namely X&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 (X=OH, CH3O, Br, NO2), CAU&#8208;10, MIL&#8208;69, and Al(OH)ndc (ndc=1,4&#8208;naphtalenedicarboxylate), highlighting the potential benefits of extending the use of this modulator to other coordination materials.

      <title>Asymmetric Construction of Alkaloids by Employing a Key &#969;&#8208;Transaminase Cascade</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic cascade has been developed for the synthesis of hexahydroquinoline and tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, relying on a key transaminase&#8208;mediated aza&#8208;Michael reaction followed by [3+3] annulation.







Abstract
An &#969;&#8208;transaminase&#8208;triggered intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction has been employed for the preparation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enaminones in good yield and excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, starting from easily accessible prochiral ketoynones and commercially available enzymes. The powerful thermodynamic driving force associated with the spontaneous aza&#8208;Michael reaction effectively displaces the transaminase reaction equilibrium towards product formation, using only two equivalents of isopropylamine. To demonstrate the potential of this methodology, this biocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael step was combined with annulation chemistry, affording unique stereo&#8208;defined fused alkaloid architectures.

      <title>Ambident Nucleophilic Substitution: Understanding Non&#8208;HSAB Behavior through Activation Strain and Conceptual DFT Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Faced Nucleophiles! We provide intuitive design rules to predict ambident reactivity for SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions, based on detailed quantum&#8208;chemical activation strain analyses. Our approach overcomes issues that arise from the use of the widely employed HSAB principle and constitutes a more comprehensive predictive model.







Abstract
The ability to understand and predict ambident reactivity is key to the rational design of organic syntheses. An approach to understand trends in ambident reactivity is the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. The recent controversy over the general validity of this principle prompted us to investigate the competing gas&#8208;phase SN2 reaction channels of archetypal ambident nucleophiles CN&#8722;, OCN&#8722;, and SCN&#8722; with CH3Cl (SN2@C) and SiH3Cl (SN2@Si), using DFT calculations. Our combined analyses highlight the inability of the HSAB principle to correctly predict the reactivity trends of these simple, model reactions. Instead, we have successfully traced reactivity trends to the canonical orbital&#8208;interaction mechanism and the resulting nucleophile&#8211;substrate interaction energy. The HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital interactions set the trend in both SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions. We provide simple rules for predicting the ambident reactivity of nucleophiles based on our Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analysis.

Our approach overcomes issues that arise from the use of the widely employed HSAB principle and constitutes a more comprehensive predictive model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to understand and predict ambident reactivity is key to the rational design of organic syntheses. An approach to understand trends in ambident reactivity is the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. The recent controversy over the general validity of this principle prompted us to investigate the competing gas&#8208;phase S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction channels of archetypal ambident nucleophiles CN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, OCN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and SCN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@C) and SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@Si), using DFT calculations. Our combined analyses highlight the inability of the HSAB principle to correctly predict the reactivity trends of these simple, model reactions. Instead, we have successfully traced reactivity trends to the canonical orbital&#8208;interaction mechanism and the resulting nucleophile&#8211;substrate interaction energy. The HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital interactions set the trend in both S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@C and S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@Si reactions. We provide simple rules for predicting the ambident reactivity of nucleophiles based on our Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic Structure Engineering of Carbon Nitride Materials by Using Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
      <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of carbon nitride (CN) polymers with predesigned charge&#8208;separation centres is reported, using supramolecular assemblies modified with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as reactants. The new CN materials exhibit excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting reaction.







Abstract
The design of charge separation sites under illumination in semiconductors is a standing challenge for their utilization as photo(electro)catalysts. Here, the synthesis of modified carbon nitride materials (CNs) with donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) domains, with altering electronic structure, is reported. To do so, new monomers based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazine were designed, which were then embedded within cyanuric acid&#8211;melamine supramolecular assemblies to form CN precursors. The conjugation degree of PAHs was systematically changed, from single benzene ring up to pyrene unit, elucidating the role of the conjugation degree on the morphology, structure and electronic properties as well as photo(electro)catalytic activity. The careful design of the D&#8211;A sites results in excellent photocatalytic activity as well as long&#8208;term stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, PAH&#8211;CNs films exhibit enhanced charge separation, optical absorption, electrochemical surface area and electronic conductivity, leading to an outstanding photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity compared to pristine CN.

Abstract
Herein, we present the synthesis of the bench&#8208;stable sodium bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfinate (BCP&#8208;SO2Na) and its application in the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) sulfones and sulfonamides. The salt can be obtained in a four&#8208;step procedure from commercially available precursors in multigram scale without the need for column chromatography or crystallization. Sulfinates are known to be useful precursors in radical and nucleophilic reactions and are widely used in medicinal chemistry. This building block enables access to BCP sulfones and sulfonamides avoiding the volatile [1.1.1]propellane which is favorable for the extension of SAR studies. Further, BCP&#8208;SO2Na enables the synthesis of products that were not available with previous methods. A chlorination of BCP&#8208;SO2Na and subsequent reaction with a Grignard reagent provides a new route to BCP sulfoxides. Several products were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Transformer&#8208;tive chemistry: High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) is changing the way we work in many fields of chemistry. A personal perspective, describing the distinctions between traditional synthetic organic chemistry and HTE from a careers and impact viewpoint.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) is a growing, enabling technology that allows the execution of large, parallel sets of experiments. Often, automation is required to dose compounds on milligram to sub&#8208;milligram scale, to run many parallel reactions, and to analyse large datasets. Unique approaches to screen design, implementation, and analysis are required, distinct from traditional synthetic organic chemistry. The discipline also presents a profitable opportunity for individual scientists to learn about and explore fields adjacent to chemistry, including data science, robotics and equipment engineering, and computer programming. This perspective presents the author's viewpoints on the field of HTE, its implementation within a chemistry career, and the automated future of organic chemistry technology.

      <title>Multi&#8208;Spectroscopic Interrogation of the Spatial Linker Distribution in Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystals: The [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] Showcase
</title>
      <dc:description>
Questioning the Suspects! Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy has revealed that defective 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC) linkers are located only in some crystals of [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] (BTC=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate) after co&#8208;crystallization into defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy in combination with other bulk techniques has shed light on the effects of this dispersion on the material (e.g., on metal oxidation state, the formation of mesopores or the crystal size).







Abstract
In the past few years, defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (DEMOFs) have been studied due to the plethora of textural, catalytic, or magnetic properties that can be enhanced by carefully introducing defect sites into the crystal lattices of MOFs. In this work, the spatial distribution of two different non&#8208;defective and defective linkers, namely 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) and 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC), respectively, has been studied in different DEMOF crystals of the HKUST&#8208;1 topology. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy revealed a nonhomogeneous distribution of defect sites within the [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] crystals, with the CYDC linker incorporated into defect&#8208;rich or defect&#8208;free areas of selected crystals. Additionally, advanced bulk techniques have shed light on the nature of the copper species, which is highly dynamic and directly affects the reactivity of the copper sites, as shown by probe molecule FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed the effect of co&#8208;crystallizing CYDC and BTC on the crystal size and the formation of mesopores, further corroborated by X&#8208;ray scattering analysis. In this way we have demonstrated the necessity of utilizing micro&#8208;spectroscopy along with a whole array of bulk spectroscopic techniques to fully describe multicomponent metal&#8211;organic frameworks.

Iron power! Iron&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions were reported that are based on the decarboxylation/dehydrogenation of keto acids and decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes to obtain the valuable aryl ketones and ketone esters.







Abstract
The radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction is an important synthetic strategy. In this study, the iron&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction based on the decarboxylation of keto acids and decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes to obtain valuable aryl ketones is reported for the first time. Remarkably, when tertiary aldehydes were used as carbonyl sources, ketone esters were selectively obtained instead of ketones. The gram&#8208;scale preparation of aryl ketone through this strategy was easily achieved by using only 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the iron catalyst. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the bioactive molecule flurprimidol was synthesized in two steps by using this strategy.

      <title>Molecular Engineering Approaches Towards All&#8208;Organic White Light Emitting Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The great white hope: Molecular engineering approaches for the development of all&#8208;organic WLE materials are analyzed in view of different photophysical processes like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), charge transfer (CT), monomer&#8208;excimer emission, triplet&#8208;state harvesting, etc. The key aspect of tuning the molecular fluorescence under the influence of pH, heat, and host&#8211;guest interactions is also discussed (see graphic).







Abstract
White light emitting (WLE) materials are of increasing interest owing to their promising applications in artificial lighting, display devices, molecular sensors, and switches. In this context, organic WLE materials cater to the interest of the scientific community owing to their promising features like color purity, long&#8208;term stability, solution processability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and low toxicity. The typical method for the generation of white light is to combine three primary (red, green, and blue) or the two complementary (e.g., yellow and blue or red and cyan) emissive units covering the whole visible spectral window (400&#8211;800&#8197;nm). The judicious choice of molecular building blocks and connecting them through either strong covalent bonds or assembling through weak noncovalent interactions are the key to achieve enhanced emission spanning the entire visible region. In the present review article, molecular engineering approaches for the development of all&#8208;organic WLE materials are analyzed in view of different photophysical processes like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), charge transfer (CT), monomer&#8208;excimer emission, triplet&#8208;state harvesting, etc. The key aspect of tuning the molecular fluorescence under the influence of pH, heat, and host&#8211;guest interactions is also discussed. The white light emission obtained from small organic molecules to supramolecular assemblies is presented, including polymers, micelles, and also employing covalent organic frameworks. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge in the field of organic WLE materials, challenges, and future scope are delineated.

      <title>Epitaxial Cubic Silicon Carbide Photocathodes for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Thin films: For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level.







Abstract
Cubic silicon carbide (3C&#8208;SiC) material feature a suitable bandgap and high resistance to photocorrosion. Thus, it has been emerged as a promising semiconductor for hydrogen evolution. Here, the relationship between the photoelectrochemical properties and the microstructures of different SiC materials is demonstrated. For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as the photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level. This finding offers a strategy to design SiC&#8208;based photocathodes with superior photoelectrochemical performances.

      <title>Molecular Packing&#8208;Controlled Mechanical&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement of Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Functionalised Pyrazoline Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic writing: Four aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement were designed, synthesised and systematic studied. Their use as rewritable data storage materials was demonstrated.







Abstract
Organic mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement (MIEE) are scarce. Herein, Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with various non&#8208;conjugated substituent groups (Br, F, N,N&#8208;dimethylamino and cyano groups for TPEB, TPEF, TPEN and TPECN, respectively) were designed and synthesised. The fluorescence spectra of the compounds in the solid state were sensitive to mechanical stimuli and exhibited unique MFC properties. The solid fluorescence peaks of all compounds were red shifted, whereas the quantum yields of TPEB, TPEF and TPEN were increased and that of TPECN was slightly reduced after grinding. The MIEE mechanism was systematically investigated through structure&#8211;property relationship studies. The results showed that the pyrazoline ring of TPEB with MIEE property formed H&#8208;dimer aggregates with weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state. After grinding, the synergistic effects of conformational planarization and destructive &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induced the red shift of the fluorescence peak and the intensity enhanced. TPECN formed incompact J&#8208;aggregates with weak intermolecular interactions instead. The conformational planarization and increased intermolecular interactions induced by grinding led to the red&#8208;shifted peak and the slightly reduced intensity. These results clearly demonstrated that the translation of packing arrangements is an efficient method to design MIEE materials, which opens a new scope for designing unique MFC materials.

      <title>Matrix Effects in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalyst Particle: Influence on Structure, Acidity, and Accessibility</title>
      <dc:description>Matrix effects in a Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst has been studied in terms of structure, accessibility, and acidity. An extensive characterization study into the structural and acidic properties of a FCC catalyst, its individual components (i.e., zeolite H&#8208;Y, binder (boehmite/silica) and kaolin clay), and two model FCC catalyst samples containing only two components (i.e., zeolite&#8208;binder and binder&#8208;clay) was performed at relevant conditions. This allowed drawing conclusions about the role of each individual component, describing their mutual physicochemical interactions, establishing structure&#8208;acidity relationships, and determining matrix effects in FCC catalyst materials. This has been made possible by using a wide variety of characterization techniques, including temperature programmed desorption of ammonia, infrared spectroscopy in combination with CO as probe molecule, transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Ar physisorption and advanced nuclear magnetic resonance. By doing so, it was for example revealed that a freshly prepared spray&#8208;dried FCC catalyst appears as a physical mixture of its individual components, but under typical riser reactor conditions, the interaction between zeolite H&#8208;Y and binder material is significant and mobile aluminum migrates and inserts from the binder into the defects of the zeolite framework, thereby creating additional Br&#248;nsted acid sites and restoring the framework structure.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Facile redox&#8208;induced aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic interconversion was accomplished with &#946;&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;21,23&#8208;dithiaporphyrin. The introduced cyano groups not only increased the reduction potentials of the porphyrin core, but also stabilized the antiaromatic state of isophlorin by conjugation.







Abstract
Facile redox&#8208;induced aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic interconversions were accomplished by using &#946;&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;21,23&#8208;dithiaporphyrin (CN4S2Por). Introduced cyano groups not only increased the reduction potential of the porphyrin core but also stabilized the antiaromatic isophlorin (CN4S2Iph) by &#960; conjugation. The reduction of CN4S2Por with hydrazine in polar solvents quantitatively affords CN4S2Iph, even under ambient conditions. CN4S2Iph retains a nearly planar conformation and exhibits considerable antiaromaticity. Aerobic oxidation of CN4S2Iph to CN4S2Por occurs in nonpolar solvents. This study was conducted to contribute to the understanding of the structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationship.

      <title>Controlled growth of SrxBa1&#8208;xNb2O6&#160;hopper&#8208; and cube&#8208;shaped nanostructures by hydrothermal synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the shape and size of nanostructured materials has been a topic of interest in the field of material science for decades. In this work, the ferroelectric material SrxBa1&#8208;xNb2O6 (x = 0.32&#8211;0.82, SBN) was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, and the morphology is controllably changed from cube&#8208;shaped to hollow&#8208;ended structures based on a fundamental understanding of the precursor chemistry. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering and PDF analysis was used to reveal the structure of the Nb&#8208;acid precursor, showing Lindqvist&#8208;like motifs. The changing growth mechanism, from layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth forming cubes to hopper&#8208;growth giving hollow&#8208;ended structures, is attributed to differences in supersaturation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an inhomogeneous composition along the length of the hollow&#8208;ended particles, which is explained by preferential formation of the high entropy composition, SBN33, at the initial stages of particle nucleation and growth.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Pathway dependence is common in self&#8208;assembly. Here, we show the importance of pathway dependence for redox&#8208;driven gels by constructing a Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic gel system. We show that in situ oxidation of the Fe(II) ions at different rates results in conversion of a Fe(II)&#8208;gel into a Fe(III)&#8208;organic gel, which controls the material properties such as gel stiffness, gel strength, and an unusual swelling behaviour. The rate of formation of Fe(III) ions determines the extent of intermolecular interactions and so whether gelation or precipitation occurs.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Assemblies for Electronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
This work reveals a synergy between supramolecular chemistry and molecular electronics. A perylene diimide&#8208;bithiophene conjugated macrocycle is shown to act as a potent receptor for fullerenes, resulting in strong electronic communication between host and guest. When incorporated into the active layer of an organic field effect transistor (OFET) device, these supramolecular complexes enhance electron mobility relative to the empty macrocycle.







Abstract
This work presents a synergy between organic electronics and supramolecular chemistry, in which a host&#8211;guest complex is designed to function as an efficacious electronic material. Specifically, the noncovalent recognition of a fullerene, phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), by an alternating perylene diimide (P)&#8208;bithiophene (B) conjugated macrocycle (PBPB) results in a greater than five&#8208;fold enhancement in electron mobility, relative to the macrocycle alone. Characterization and quantification of the binding of fullerenes by host PBPB is provided alongside evidence for intermolecular electronic communication within the host&#8211;guest complexes.

      <dc:description>

Abstract
Pd&#8208;mediated reactions have emerged as a powerful tool for the site&#8208;selective and bioorthogonal late&#8208;stage diversification of amino acids, peptides and related compounds. Indole moieties of tryptophan derivatives are susceptible to C2H&#8208;activation, whereas halogenated aromatic amino acids such as halophenylalanines or halotryptophans provide a broad spectrum of different functionalisations. The compatibility of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;couplings with functional groups in peptides, other biologically active compounds and even proteins has been demonstrated. This Review primarily compiles the application of different cross&#8208;coupling reactions to modify halotryptophans, halotryptophan containing peptides or halogenated, biologically active compounds derived from tryptophan. Modern approaches use regio&#8208; and stereoselective biocatalytic strategies to generate halotryptophans and derivatives on a preparative scale. The combination of bio&#8208; and chemocatalysis in cascade reactions is given by the biocompatibility and bioorthogonality of Pd&#8208;mediated reactions.

      <title>Amphiphilic Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Dyes: Synthesis, Fluorescence and Aggregation Behaviors in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Amphiphilic donor/acceptor dyes were synthesized from unsymmetrically substituted perylene bisimide dyes, which were obtained by three synthetic methods. The optical behaviors and aggregation behaviors of these functional dyes were studied by UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The donor/acceptor dye displays high efficient intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (96.4%) from pyrene to peylene bisimide chromophores, which leads to a high fluorescence color sensitivity to environment polarity. Under 365nm UV lamp, the light&#8208;emitting colors of donor/acceptor dye change from green to yellow with increasing solvent polarity, which demonstrates application potentials as a new class of fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes. The donor/acceptor dye in water was assembled into hollow vesicles with narrow size distribution as revealed by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements. The bilayer structure of vesicular wall was directly observed by transmission electron microscopy. These vesicular aggregates in water are fluorescent at 650&#8208;850 nm within near&#8208;infrared region.</dc:description>

      <title>Multivariate analysis of coupled operando EPR/XANES/ EXAFS/UV&#8211;vis/ATR&#8211;IR spectroscopy: A new dimension for mechanistic studies of catalytic gas&#8208;liquid phase reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Operando EPR, XANES/EXAFS, UV&#8208;vis and ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopic methods have been coupled for the first time in the same experimental setup for investigating unclear mechanistic aspects of selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by a Cu/TEMPO catalytic system. By Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares Fitting (MCR&#8208;ALS) of simultaneously recorded XAS and UV&#8208;vis data sets, it was found that an initially formed (bpy)(NMI)Cu I &#8722; complex is converted to two different Cu II species, a mononuclear (bpy)(NMI)(CH 3 CN)Cu II &#8722;OOH species detectable by EPR and ESI&#8208;MS and an EPR&#8208;silent dinuclear (CH 3 CN) (bpy)(NMI)Cu II (&#956;&#8208;OH) 2 Cu II (bpy)(NMI) complex. The latter is cleaved in the further course of reaction into (bpy)(NMI)(HOO)Cu II &#8722;TEMPO monomers that are also EPR&#8208;silent due dipolar interaction with bound TEMPO. Both Cu monomers and the Cu dimer are catalytically active in the initial phase of the reaction, yet the dimer is definitely not a major active species nor a resting state since it is irreversibly cleaved in the course of the reaction while catalytic activity is maintained. Gradual formation of non&#8208;reducible Cu II leads to slight deactivation at extended reaction times.</dc:description>

      <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Cyclophanes as Crystalline Sponge and Their [2]Catenanes through SNAr Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
[2]Catenanes and porous cyclophane&#8208;based crystals: A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of adamantane&#8208;bearing cyclophanes and [2]catenanes has been achieved by SNAr reactions. The cyclophane&#8208;based organic crystals had permanent intrinsic porosity and were applied to the crystalline sponge method, by which the molecular structures of incorporated leaf alcohol and aldehyde were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
This work reports that cyclophanes and their [2]catenanes were synthesized by the SNAr reactions of disubstituted adamantanes bearing halophenol units and 3,6&#8208;dichlorotetrazine in moderate yields. In the crystalline state, the cyclophanes had hexagonal structures with a cavity. The [2]catenanes were composed of two macrocycles that were singly interlocked and orthogonally arranged, indicating the construction from eight component molecules through eight C&#8722;O bonds in a one&#8208;step reaction in up to 33&#8201;% yield. The cyclophanes were assembled to afford a supramolecular organic framework in the solid state, which exhibited permanent intrinsic porosity and adsorption of leaf alcohol or aldehyde in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal fashion. The molecular structures of the liquid guests were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The formation of catenanes and the use of cyclophane&#8208;based porous crystals in the crystalline sponge method may be largely ascribed to the solvophobic effects and the van der Waals interactions that originate in the aliphatic and bulky nature of the adamantane units.

      <title>A Comparative Study on the Thermodynamics of Halogen Bonding of Group&#8197;10 Pincer Fluoride Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Pincer complexes studied: Group&#8197;10 POCOP (&#954;3&#8208;C6HR2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OPtBu2)2; R=H, tBu) fluoride complexes show pronounced halogen bonding with iodopentafluorobenzene in toluene. Along an isostructural series of complexes, Pd fluorides show the strongest interactions.







Abstract
The thermodynamics of halogen bonding of a series of isostructural Group&#8197;10 metal pincer fluoride complexes of the type [(3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu)MF] (3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu=&#954;3&#8208;C6HR2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OPtBu2)2 with R=H, tBu, COOMe; M=Ni, Pd, Pt) and iodopentafluorobenzene was investigated. Based on NMR experiments at different temperatures, all complexes&#8197;1&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Ni), 2&#8208;H (R=H, M=Pd), 2&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pd), 2&#8208;COOMe (R=COOMe, M=Pd) and 3&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pt) form strong halogen bonds with Pd complexes showing significantly stronger binding to iodopentafluorobenzene. Structural and computational analysis of a model adduct of complex&#8197;2&#8208;tBu with 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene as well as of structures of iodopentafluorobenzene in toluene solution shows that formation of a type&#8197;I contact occurs.
