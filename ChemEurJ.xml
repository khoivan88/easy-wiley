      <title>Extraction of graphene nanostructures from Colocasia esculenta and Nelumbo nucifera leaves and surface functionalization with tin oxide: Evaluation of their antibacterial properties</title>
      <dc:description>Expeditious evolution of antimicrobial resistance in recent years has been identified as a growing concern by various health organizations around the world. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign production of highly antibacterial carbonaceous nanomaterials from  Colocasia esculenta  and  Nelumbo nucifera  leaves for the first time. After carbonization and oxidative treatment, smaller graphene domains are formed in  Colocasia esculenta  derivatives whereas larger sheet&#8208;like structures are spotted in the case of  Nelumbo nucifera  . Smaller particle size makes quantum confinement effects more prominent as evident in fine tuning of photoluminescence emission after each stage of treatment. We also demonstrate the influence of precursor materials in dictating the antibacterial properties of nano&#8208;systems. When microbicidal activity was tested against model bacteria  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  , nanocomposite derived from  Colocasia esculenta  leaves displayed higher activity than the antibiotic drug Clarithromycin (control) with a measured zone of inhibition of 40 &#177; 0.5 mm. This is one of the highest values reported in comparison with other plant&#8208;based carbon&#8208;silver nano&#8208;systems. From quantitative analysis, it is discerned that nanocomposite obtained from  Colocasia esculenta  leaves has antimicrobial efficacy equivalent to commercial antibiotic drugs and is able to eradicate bacteria at much lower concentrations when compared to those from  Nelumbo nucifera  leaves.</dc:description>

      <title>Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism: A Playground for Molecular Chemists</title>
      <dc:description>Magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism (MChD) is a non&#8208;reciprocal manifestation of light&#8208;matter interaction that can be observed in chiral systems possessing a magnetization, either spontaneous or induced by an external magnetic field. It features a differential absorption or emission of unpolarized light that depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization with respect to the direction of light propagation and on the absolute configuration of the system.&#160;Molecular chemistry is the best&#8208;suited route towards systems combining chirality and magnetism. Nowadays, the investigation of MChD is still in its infancy although this effect might play a fundamental role in technological applications, such as optical readout of magnetic data with unpolarized light. With this minireview, we aim at providing a precise description of this unconventional effect, recall the main results obtained so far and highlight the remaining challenges, underlining the opportunities opened to molecular chemists interested in investigating this fascinating effect with implications in chemistry and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Optically Triggered Control of the Charge Carrier Density in Chemically Functionalized Graphene Field Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Optically switchable graphene FET: Via van der Waals assembly of an approximately 1&#8197;nm thick azobenzene functionalized molecular nanosheets with single layer graphene, optically responsive field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated. The electrical carrier density of these devices can be modulated using optical stimuli, 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules. The azobenzene molecules were incorporated to the GFET channel by building a van der Waals heterostructure with a carbon nanomembrane (CNM), which is used as a molecular interposer to attach the azobenzene molecules. Under exposure with 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light, azobenzene molecules transition between cis and trans molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment. Thus, the effective electric field acting on the GFET channel is tuned by optical stimulation and the carrier density is modulated.

      <title>Is There a Single Ideal Parameter for Halogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Based Lewis Acidity?</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspecting halogen bonding: Is it possible to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strength accurately by a single DFT calculation and achieve better performance than that offered by the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth?







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bond donors (halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids) have now found various applications in diverse fields of chemistry. The goal of this study was to identify a parameter obtainable from a single DFT calculation that reliably describes halogen&#8208;bonding strength (Lewis acidity). First, several DFT methods were benchmarked against the CCSD(T) CBS binding data of complexes of 17 carbon&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donors with chloride and ammonia as representative Lewis bases, which revealed M05&#8208;2X with a partially augmented def2&#8208;TZVP(D) basis set as the best model chemistry. The best single parameter to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strengths was the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth, but it still provided inaccurate predictions for a series of compounds. Thus, a more reliable parameter, &#937;&#963;*, has been developed through the linear combination of the &#963;&#8208;hole depth and the &#963;*(C&#8722;I) energy, which was further validated against neutral, cationic, halogen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donors with very good performance.

      <title>In a Quest for Selectivity Paired with Activity: A Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalyst Bearing an Unsymmetrical Phenanthrene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective, but still active! A ruthenium catalyst containing phenanthrene&#8208;based unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand has been synthesized. Its anomalous reactivity at 40&#8201;&#176;C contrasts known N&#8208;benzyl Hoveyda&#8208;type complexes that need high temperatures to operate. Simultaneously, it keeps high selectivity towards olefin metathesis products (see graphic).







Abstract
Robust, selective, and stable in the presence of ethylene, ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst, {[3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9&#8208;phenanthryl)]&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinylidene}dichloro(o&#8208;isopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium(II), Ru&#8208;3, bearing an unsymetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (uNHC) ligand, has been synthesized. The initiation rate of Ru&#8208;3 was examined by ring&#8208;closing metathesis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions with a broad spectrum of olefins, showing an unprecendented selectivity. It was also tested in industrially relevant ethenolysis reactions of olefinic substrates from renewable feedstock with very good yields and selectivities.

      <title>An Enantiopure Propeller&#8208;Like Trityl&#8208;Brominated Radical: Bringing Together a High Racemization Barrier and an Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescent Magnetic Emitter</title>
      <dc:description>
Get radical! An efficient circularly polarized luminescence emitter, based on a persistent trityl radical substituted with bulky bromine atoms at ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, is reported (see figure). In addition, this emitter has a high racemization barrier between its enantiomers.







Abstract
A new persistent organic free radical has been synthetized with Br atoms occupying the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions of a trityl core. After the isolation of its two propeller&#8208;like atropisomers, Plus (P) and minus (M), their absolute configurations were assigned by a combination of theoretical and experimental data. Remarkably, no hints of racemization were observed up to 60&#8201;&#176;C for more than two hours, due to the higher steric hindrance imposed by the bulky Br atoms. Therefore, when compared to its chlorinated homologue (t1/2=18&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C), an outstanding stability against racemization was achieved. A circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response of both enantiomers was detected. This free radical shows a satisfactory luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum(592&#8197;nm)|&#8776;0.7&#215;10&#8722;3) despite its pure organic nature and low luminescence quantum yield (LQY). Improved organic magnetic CPL emitters derived from the reported structure can be envisaged thanks to the wide possibilities that Br atoms at para&#8208;positions offer for further functionalization.

This free radical shows a satisfactory luminescent dissymmetry factor (|g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;(592&#8197;nm)|&#8776;0.7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) despite its pure organic nature and low luminescence quantum yield (LQY). Improved organic magnetic CPL emitters derived from the reported structure can be envisaged thanks to the wide possibilities that Br atoms at &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;positions offer for further functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exciton Interactions, Excimer Formation, and [2&#960;+2&#960;] Photodimerization in Nonconjugated Curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Folding chromophores: A series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes has been synthesized. The compounds display solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission as a result of a folding process controlling intramolecular chromophore aggregation. An in&#8208;depth investigation of their photophysical properties allowed a complex kinetic scheme to be established and provided a rationale for the formation of the first example of photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of a series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes and the detailed investigation of their solvent&#8208;dependent spectroscopic and photophysical properties. In solvents of low polarity, intramolecular folding induces the formation of aggregated chromophores, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of which display the optical signature characteristic of weakly&#8208;coupled H&#8208;aggregates. The extent of folding and, in turn, of ground&#8208;state aggregation is strongly dependent on the nature of the flexible linker. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopies show that the Frenkel exciton relaxes into a fluorescent symmetrical excimer state with a long lifetime. Furthermore, our in&#8208;depth studies show that a weakly emitting excimer lies on the pathway toward a photocyclomer. Two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) allowed the structure of the photoproduct to be established. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a [2&#960;+2&#960;] photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.

      <title>Interception of Elusive Cationic Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn Heterobimetallic Adducts with Mixed Alkyl Bridges Featuring Multiple Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Weak but important: NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies reveal that weak agostic interactions play a central role in the stabilization of elusive Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn heterobimetallic complexes featuring inequivalent bridging alkyl groups, which are important species for several catalytic processes of industrial relevance.







Abstract
Heterobimetallic complexes with inequivalent bridging alkyl chains are very often invoked as key intermediates in many catalytic processes, yet their interception and structural characterization are lacking. Such complexes have been prepared from reactions of the cationic cyclometalated hafnocene [CpPrCp
Hf][B(C6F5)4] (1) with main group metal alkyls to afford the corresponding hetero&#8208;bridged cationic products, [CpPrCp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;R)E(R)n][B(C6F5)4] (E=Al or Zn; R=Me, Et, or iBu). NMR and DFT studies demonstrate that both bridging alkyls establish agostic interactions with Hf, which are appreciably stronger for ethyl rather than methyl groups. Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn distances are surprisingly short and only slightly longer than computed Hf&#8211;Al or Hf&#8211;Zn single bond lengths (2.80&#8197;&#197;). Finally, a reaction of [CpPrCp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;Me)Zn(Me)][B(C6F5)4] with excess ZnMe2 yields an unprecedented heterotrimetallic species, [(CpPr)2Hf(&#956;&#8208;Me)(ZnMe)(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)ZnMe][B(C6F5)4], the detailed structure of which is elucidated by a combination of NMR spectroscopic methods and molecular calculations.

      <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the crystal phase dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures were synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step colloidal method, and the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor exhibited much improved sensing performance due to the formation of p&#8211;n hetero&#8208;junctions.







Abstract
The formation of semiconductor heterostructures is an effective approach to achieve high performance in electrical gas sensing. However, such heterostructures are usually prepared via multi&#8208;step procedures. In this contribution, by taking advantage of the crystal phase&#8208;dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, we report a one&#8208;step colloid method for the preparation of SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures, with x &#8776;30, 50, and 70. The obtained materials with solution processability were successfully fabricated into NO2 sensors. Among them, the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor with an active layer thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m exhibited the highest sensitivity to NO2 (30&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;ppm) with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 69&#8197;ppb at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). This was mainly attributed to the formation of p&#8211;n junctions that allowed for gas&#8208;induced modification of the junction barriers. Under 405&#8197;nm laser illumination, the sensor performance was further enhanced, exhibiting a 3.5&#8197;times increased response toward 0.1&#8197;ppm NO2, along with a recovery time of 4.6&#8197;min.

      <dc:description>
A new strategy for activity&#8208;based probes is reported to address the members of the proteome that target &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine posttranslational modifications, which are highly prevalent and constitute a continuously expanding collection of chemical groups.

Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are important in the regulation of protein function, trafficking, localization, and marking for degradation. This work describes the development of peptide activity/affinity&#8208;based probes for the discovery of proteins that recognize novel acyl&#8208;based PTMs on lysine residues in the proteome. The probes contain surrogates of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine by introduction of either hydrazide or thioamide functionalities to circumvent hydrolysis of the modification during the experiments. In addition to the modified PTMs, the developed chemotypes were analyzed with respect to the effect of peptide sequence. The photo cross&#8208;linking conditions and subsequent functionalization of the covalent adducts were systematically optimized by applying fluorophore labeling and gel electrophoresis (in&#8208;gel fluorescence measurements). Finally, selected probes, containing the &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;glutaryllysine and &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;myristoyllysine analogues, were successfully applied for the enrichment of native, endogenous proteins from cell lysate, recapitulating the expected interactions of SIRT5 and SIRT2, respectively. Interestingly, the latter mentioned was able to pull down two different splice variants of SIRT2, which has not been achieved with a covalent probe before. Based on this elaborate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we expect that the technology will have broad future applications for pairing of novel PTMs with the proteins that target them in the cell.

The probes contain surrogates of &#1013;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acyllysine by introduction of either hydrazide or thioamide functionalities to circumvent hydrolysis of the modification during the experiments. In addition to the modified PTMs, the developed chemotypes were analyzed with respect to the effect of peptide sequence. The photo cross&#8208;linking conditions and subsequent functionalization of the covalent adducts were systematically optimized by applying fluorophore labeling and gel electrophoresis (in&#8208;gel fluorescence measurements). Finally, selected probes, containing the &#1013;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glutaryllysine and &#1013;&lt;i&gt;&#8208;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;myristoyllysine analogues, were successfully applied for the enrichment of native, endogenous proteins from cell lysate, recapitulating the expected interactions of SIRT5 and SIRT2, respectively. Interestingly, the latter mentioned was able to pull down two different splice variants of SIRT2, which has not been achieved with a covalent probe before. Based on this elaborate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we expect that the technology will have broad future applications for pairing of novel PTMs with the proteins that target them in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catechol Thioesters: Ligands for Hierarchically Formed Lithium&#8208;Bridged Titanium(IV) Helicates and Helicate&#8208;Based Switches</title>
      <dc:description>
Titanium springs: Titanium (IV) triscatechol thioester complexes form in the presence of lithium cations dinuclear helicates, showing a monomer&#8211;dimer equilibrium with dimerization tendencies lying between those of the corresponding ketones and oxoesters. Based on this principle, it is possible to obtain a switchable spring&#8208;type helicate which shows some spontaneous expansion in [D6]DMSO.







Abstract
The thioester moiety is introduced as a lithium binding unit for the hierarchical formation of titanium(IV) catecholate&#8208;based lithium&#8208;bridged helicates. In solution, the coordination compounds show a monomer&#8211;dimer equilibrium which &#8212;in comparison to the oxo esters&#8212; is significantly shifted towards the monomers. In addition, the influence of the thioester side chain on the dimerization behavior is investigated and an expansible/compressible molecular switch is synthesized. In the latter case expansion and compression are performed reversibly in methanol, whereas in DMSO spontaneous expansion occurs.

      <title>Synthesis and Systematic Structural Analysis of Cationic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ruthenium Chalcogenocarbonyl Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium Half&#8208;Sandwiches: The synthesis and properties of a series of cationic chalcogenocarbonyl complexes of the type [CpRu(CE)(H2IMes)(CNCH2Ts)][BArF4] (H2IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; E=O, S, Se, Te) are reported herein. This series includes very rare examples of selenocarbonyl (CSe) and tellurocarbonyl (CTe) complexes of Ru&#8722;Cp fragments. The &#960;&#8208;acidic nature of the CE ligands increases upon descending the main group, and the stereochemical stability of the obtained chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal CE complexes is very high.







Abstract
Although the chemistry of transition&#8208;metal complexes with carbonyl (CO) and thiocarbonyl (CS) ligands has been well developed, their heavier analogues, namely selenocarbonyl (CSe) and tellurocarbonyl (CTe) complexes remain scarce. The limited availability of such CSe and CTe complexes has so far hampered our understanding of the differences between such chalcogenocarbonyl (CE: E=O, S, Se, Te) ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of a series of cationic half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium CE complexes of the type [CpRu(CE)(H2IMes)(CNCH2Ts)][BArF4] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5&#8722;; H2IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). A combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR spectroscopic analyses, and DFT calculations revealed an increasing &#960;&#8208;accepting ability of the CE ligands in the order O&lt;S&lt;Se&lt;Te. A variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis of the thus obtained chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal CE complexes indicated high stereochemical stability.

      <title>Ambident Nucleophilic Substitution: Understanding Non&#8208;HSAB Behavior through Activation Strain and Conceptual DFT Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Faced Nucleophiles! We provide intuitive design rules to predict ambident reactivity for SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions, based on detailed quantum&#8208;chemical activation strain analyses. Our approach overcomes issues that arise from the use of the widely employed HSAB principle and constitutes a more comprehensive predictive model.







Abstract
The ability to understand and predict ambident reactivity is key to the rational design of organic syntheses. An approach to understand trends in ambident reactivity is the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. The recent controversy over the general validity of this principle prompted us to investigate the competing gas&#8208;phase SN2 reaction channels of archetypal ambident nucleophiles CN&#8722;, OCN&#8722;, and SCN&#8722; with CH3Cl (SN2@C) and SiH3Cl (SN2@Si), using DFT calculations. Our combined analyses highlight the inability of the HSAB principle to correctly predict the reactivity trends of these simple, model reactions. Instead, we have successfully traced reactivity trends to the canonical orbital&#8208;interaction mechanism and the resulting nucleophile&#8211;substrate interaction energy. The HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital interactions set the trend in both SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions. We provide simple rules for predicting the ambident reactivity of nucleophiles based on our Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analysis.

Bifunctional catalyst: Bimodal functionality toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photochemical H2 evolution of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) is explored. Tuning of the side&#8208;chain substitutions on oligo&#8208;(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene bola&#8208;amphiphilic struts shows distinct nanostructuring in CMPs, which has a high impact on catalytic performances.







Abstract
The designing and development of heterogeneous catalysts for conversion of renewable energy to chemical energies by electrochemical as well as photochemical processes is at the forefront of energy research. In this work, two new donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;mix and TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;gly) are synthesized through Schiff base condensation reaction using a microwave synthesizer. Notably, the asymmetric and symmetric bola&#8208;amphiphilic nature of the OPE struts results in distinct nanostructuring and morphologies in the CMPs. Interestingly, both CMPs show impressive heterogeneous catalytic activity toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions, and therefore, act as bimodal electro&#8208; and photocatalytic porous organic materials. Furthermore, the redox&#8208;active property of the CMPs is exploited for in&#8197;situ generation and stabilization of platinum nanoparticles (Pt), and these Pt@CMPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.

      <title>Solvent Impact on the Properties of Benchmark Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Synthesis of CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks: CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 were synthesized by utilizing acetonitrile as the solvent. The typical breathing behavior of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 upon guest molecule adsorption was inhibited by a high concentration of defects. As shown by NMR spectroscopy these consist of noncoordinated &#8722;COOH groups. Breathing could be enforced by applying a pressure of about 60&#8197;MPa during mercury intrusion.







Abstract
Herein is reported the utilization of acetonitrile as a new solvent for the synthesis of the three significantly different benchmark metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 of idealized composition [Al(OH)(ISO)], [Ce6O4(OH)4(BDC)6], and [Al(OH)(BDC)], respectively (ISO2&#8722;: isophthalate, BDC2&#8722;: terephthalate). Its use allowed the synthesis of Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 on a gram scale. While CAU&#8208;10 and Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 exhibit properties similar to those reported elsewhere for these two materials, the obtained Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 shows no structural flexibility upon adsorption of hydrophilic or hydrophobic guest molecules such as water and xenon and is stabilized in its large&#8208;pore form over a broad temperature range (130&#8211;450&#8197;K). The stabilization of the large&#8208;pore form of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 was attributed to a high percentage of noncoordinating &#8722;COOH groups as determined by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The defective material shows an unusually high water uptake of 310&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the range of 0.45 to 0.65&#8197;p/p&#176;. In spite of showing no breathing effect upon water adsorption it exhibits distinct mechanical properties. Thus, mercury intrusion porosimetry studies revealed that the solid can be reversibly forced to breathe by applying moderate pressures (&#8776;60&#8197;MPa).

      <title>Molecular Packing&#8208;Controlled Mechanical&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement of Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Functionalised Pyrazoline Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic writing: Four aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement were designed, synthesised and systematic studied. Their use as rewritable data storage materials was demonstrated.







Abstract
Organic mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement (MIEE) are scarce. Herein, Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with various non&#8208;conjugated substituent groups (Br, F, N,N&#8208;dimethylamino and cyano groups for TPEB, TPEF, TPEN and TPECN, respectively) were designed and synthesised. The fluorescence spectra of the compounds in the solid state were sensitive to mechanical stimuli and exhibited unique MFC properties. The solid fluorescence peaks of all compounds were red shifted, whereas the quantum yields of TPEB, TPEF and TPEN were increased and that of TPECN was slightly reduced after grinding. The MIEE mechanism was systematically investigated through structure&#8211;property relationship studies. The results showed that the pyrazoline ring of TPEB with MIEE property formed H&#8208;dimer aggregates with weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state. After grinding, the synergistic effects of conformational planarization and destructive &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induced the red shift of the fluorescence peak and the intensity enhanced. TPECN formed incompact J&#8208;aggregates with weak intermolecular interactions instead. The conformational planarization and increased intermolecular interactions induced by grinding led to the red&#8208;shifted peak and the slightly reduced intensity. These results clearly demonstrated that the translation of packing arrangements is an efficient method to design MIEE materials, which opens a new scope for designing unique MFC materials.

      <title>Ether&#8208; and Thioether&#8208;Linked Naphthalene&#8208;Based Liquid&#8208;Crystal Dimers: Influence of Chalcogen Linkage and Mesogenic&#8208;Arm Symmetry on the Incidence and Stability of the Twist&#8211;Bend Nematic Phase</title>
      <dc:description>
The chalcogen&#8208;linked naphthalene&#8208;based twist&#8211;bend nematogens: Chalcogen&#8208;based ether&#8208; and/or thioether&#8208;linked naphthalene&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystal dimers exhibit the twist&#8211;bend nematic (NTB) phase. The molecular design necessary to realize the NTB phase and its glassy state was discovered by systematically probing combinations of different chalcogen linkages, mesogenic&#8208;arm symmetry, and spacer chain length.







Abstract
The twist&#8211;bend nematic (NTB) phase with a heliconical nanostructure of the local director generating symmetry breaking by achiral bent&#8208;shaped molecules is a hot topic of current liquid&#8208;crystal science. As opposed to the most common methylene&#8208;linked dimers, this study demonstrates chalcogen ether&#8208; and/or thioether&#8208;linked 6&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystal dimers with symmetric and asymmetric &#960;&#8208;conjugated mesogenic&#8208;arm structures that exhibit the NTB phase. Although the symmetric bis(ether)&#8208;linked dimer exhibits only the conventional nematic (N) phase, the asymmetric bis(ether)&#8208;linked dimer can form the NTB phase. All thioether&#8208;linked dimers form the NTB phase, wherein the dimers with asymmetric arms vitrify in the NTB phase on cooling to room temperature. The phase transitions are discussed in terms of the chalcogen linkage combination, mesogenic&#8208;arm symmetry, and spacer length. It is revealed that thioether&#8208;linked dimers based on asymmetric &#960;&#8208;conjugated mesogenic arms with terminal cyano groups are highly beneficial for the realization of materials that form a wide range of NTB phases and glassy NTB states at room temperature.

Asymmetric annulation: With the development of a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+5] annulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with vinylethylene carbonates (VECs), an unprecedented tandem rearrangement reaction featuring a unique asymmetric aromatic Claisen rearrangement is described. This study enables not only enantioselective access to chiral medium&#8208;sized benzoheterocycles, but also gives a new asymmetric method for constructing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters contained in chiral functionalized homoallylic alcohols.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+5] annulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with substituted vinylethylene carbonates (VECs) is described for the first time, giving a novel enantioselective approach to chiral nine&#8208;membered benzoheterocycles. Based on this designed [4+5] annulation, an unprecedented silica gel&#8208;promoted tandem rearrangement reaction featuring a unique asymmetric aromatic Claisen rearrangement is explored at room temperature, offering a new method for asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters embedded in chiral functionalized homoallylic alcohols.

      <dc:description>
To bond to natural terrains, animals employ diverse adaptions: prehensile tails, suction&#8208;cup toes, zygodactyl claws. Molecular bonding can also be nuanced; unraveling such mysteries is at the heart of chemistry. A series of Hf/Al, Hf/Zn complexes is bound by multiple agostic interactions from bridging alkyls and has short Hf&#8211;Al/Zn interatomic distances. One can envision agostic hydrogen atoms grasping the Hf center like toes, the electron cloud of Al/Zn brushing against it like a tail.

      <dc:description>
The twist&#8211;bend nematic (NTB) phase possessing a chiral helical nanostructure, which results from achiral bent molecules, has attracted considerable attention in liquid crystal (LC) science. This paper presents ether&#8208; and thioether&#8208;linked naphthalene&#8208;based LC dimers with symmetric and asymmetric mesogenic arms that exhibit the NTB phase, instead of the most common methylene&#8208;linked dimers. The combination of a thioether linker and asymmetric mesogenic arms is highly beneficial for realizing LC materials that exhibit a broad range of NTB phases and glassy NTB states at room temperature.

      <dc:description>
TTBrM radical, a trityl radical derivative, is the first magnetically active organic emitter combining a satisfactory CPL activity with a high stability against racemization, thanks to the steric hindrance of its bulky Br atoms. Moreover, it represents a real milestone in the field of multifunctional materials since its innovative substitution pattern also provides easy strategies for the achievement of improved organic free radicals with chiral, magnetic, and luminescent properties.

      <dc:description>
When chemistry meets biology, as in the image with a child stumbling upon the enantiomers of cetirizine in the sea, stereochemistry often governs the outcome. In aqueous environments, the process of racemisation will therefore be important and can be facilitated in a range of ways including by base, acid or enzymatic catalysis. The limited information concerning racemisation under each of these conditions is surveyed and critiqued. Tools to guide prediction of racemisation risk are presented.

Depending on the substrate structure and/or reaction conditions, cyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;2(1&#8201;H)&#8208;ones and/or phenanthridine&#8208;6(5&#8201;H)&#8208;ones have been obtained through [3+2] or [2+2+2] annulations involving aromatic or vinylic C&#8722;H activation, respectively. Reasonable mechanisms for the formation of these annulation products have been proposed based on density functional theory calculations and are presented in the Full Paper by Y. Yamamoto et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;3749&#8197;ff.

      <dc:description>
We have established that a cationic rhodium(I)/P&#8208;phos complex catalyzes the asymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;enynes with racemic secondary allylic alcohols to produce the corresponding chiral bicyclic cyclohexenes, possessing three stereogenic centers, as a single diastereomer with excellent ee values. Mechanistic experiments revealed that the present cycloaddition proceeds through the kinetic resolution of the racemic secondary allylic alcohols, in which one enantiomer preferentially reacts with the 1,6&#8208;enyne. This cover feature uses a mirror to portray how one enantiomer reacts preferentially over the other enantiomer. Also, the starry sky on the background is inspired by the structure of the bicyclic cyclohexene. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al. on page 3698.

      <title>Racemisation in Chemistry and Biology</title>
      <dc:description>
Shedding light on racemisation: Although the importance of racemisation is well known, the process remains poorly studied. In this Review, the available data concerning chemical (acid and base) and enzymatic catalysis of racemisation and predictive tools are presented and discussed. The paucity of relevant data is striking.







Abstract
The two enantiomers of a compound often have profoundly different biological properties and thus their liability to racemisation in aqueous solutions is an important piece of information. The authors reviewed the available data concerning the process of racemisation in vivo, in the presence of biological molecules (e.g., racemase enzymes, serum albumin, cofactors and derivatives) and under purely chemical but aqueous conditions (acid, base and other aqueous systems). Mechanistic studies are described critically in light of reported kinetic data. The types of experimental measurement that can be used to effectively determine rate constants of racemisation in various conditions are discussed and the data they provide is summarised. The proposed origins of enzymatic racemisation are presented and suggest ways to promote the process that are different from processes taking place in bulk water. Experimental and computational studies that provide understanding and quantitative predictions of racemisation risk are also presented.

      <title>Organophotoredox&#8208;Mediated Amide Synthesis by Coupling Alcohol and Amine through Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohol</title>
      <dc:description>
Successful interplay: A combination of an organic photocatalyst, quinuclidine, and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium phosphate, as a hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst furnished the formation of amide bonds by direct coupling of alcohols and primary/secondary amines. Possible reactions mechanisms were proposed.







Abstract
The combination of an organic photocatalyst [4CzIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6 dicyanobenzene) or 5MeOCzBN (2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentakis(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9&#8201;H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzonitrile)], quinuclidine, and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium phosphate (hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst) was employed for amide bond formations. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded OH group activated the adjacent C&#8722;H bond of alcohols towards hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) by a radical species. The quinuclidinium radical cation, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of quinuclidine by the photocatalyst, employed to abstract a hydrogen atom from the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols selectively due to a polarity effect&#8208;produced &#945;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radical, which subsequently converted to the corresponding aldehyde under aerobic conditions. Then the coupling of the aldehyde and an amine formed a hemiaminal intermediate that upon photocatalytic oxidation produced the amide.

It is attractive but highly challenging to achieve controllable regulation of photophysical properties of pure organic luminogens, due to distinct work mechanisms and molecular structures. Here, a strategy to regulate in a controllable way the emission behavior of luminogens is reported, according to which long&#8208;lived aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) can be switched to short&#8208;lived dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) by an isomer&#8208;based substitution reaction. Three luminogens with sharply different photophysical behaviors, including aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and dual&#8208;state fluorescence emission, were obtained through a substitution reaction with three isomers. Freely rotating structures are attributed to aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence behavior, whereas twisted rigidification of the molecule greatly contributes to its dual&#8208;state emission phenomenon. This work contributes to the controlled regulation of photophysical behaviors through simple reactions and provides a solid evidence to support the key role of the prohibition of intramolecular rotation in aggregation&#8208;induced emission process and molecular design of dual&#8208;state emitters.

      <title>A Promising Fluorooxoborate Framework with Flexibile Capability for Diverse Cations to Enhance the Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <dc:description>
Get flexible! The framework of the emblematic 18&#8208;membered ring has the flexibility of being able to contain different cations spanning from alkali to d10 metals. The functionality of cadmium metal cations is consolidated with [BOF] groups to enhance the second harmonic generation (see figure).







Abstract
Fluorooxoborates as potential deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have exhibited diverse structures and NLO properties with metal cationic changes. Herein, the general mechanisms of metal cations on band gaps and optical properties in a series of typical fluorooxoborates have been clarified. It reveals that the framework of the emblematic 18&#8208;membered ring oxyfluorides has the flexibility of being able to contain different cations spanning from alkali to d10 metals by investigating the stability of the artificial CdB5O7F3 structure. Besides, introducing d10 metal cations can enhance the second harmonic generation (3.1&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), d36=0.39&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1) and also keep a DUV spectral transparency (Eg&gt;6.2&#8197;eV). Thus, the d10&#8208;containing fluorooxoborate exhibits a great potential to be a new DUV optical material for nonlinear light&#8208;matter interactions.

      <title>Asymmetric Construction of Alkaloids by Employing a Key &#969;&#8208;Transaminase Cascade</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic cascade has been developed for the synthesis of hexahydroquinoline and tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, relying on a key transaminase&#8208;mediated aza&#8208;Michael reaction followed by [3+3] annulation.







Abstract
An &#969;&#8208;transaminase&#8208;triggered intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction has been employed for the preparation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enaminones in good yield and excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, starting from easily accessible prochiral ketoynones and commercially available enzymes. The powerful thermodynamic driving force associated with the spontaneous aza&#8208;Michael reaction effectively displaces the transaminase reaction equilibrium towards product formation, using only two equivalents of isopropylamine. To demonstrate the potential of this methodology, this biocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael step was combined with annulation chemistry, affording unique stereo&#8208;defined fused alkaloid architectures.

Mechanistic experiments revealed that the present cycloaddition proceeds through the kinetic resolution of the racemic secondary allylic alcohols, in which one enantiomer preferentially reacts with the 1,6&#8208;enyne (see scheme).







Abstract
It has been established that a cationic rhodium(I)/P&#8208;phos complex catalyzes the asymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;enynes with racemic secondary allylic alcohols to produce the corresponding chiral bicyclic cyclohexenes, possessing three stereogenic centers, as a single diastereomer with excellent ee values. Mechanistic experiments revealed that the present cycloaddition proceeds through the kinetic resolution of the racemic secondary allylic alcohols, in which one enantiomer preferentially reacts with the 1,6&#8208;enyne.

      <title>Supramolecular Assemblies for Electronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
This work reveals a synergy between supramolecular chemistry and molecular electronics. A perylene diimide&#8208;bithiophene conjugated macrocycle is shown to act as a potent receptor for fullerenes, resulting in strong electronic communication between host and guest. When incorporated into the active layer of an organic field effect transistor (OFET) device, these supramolecular complexes enhance electron mobility relative to the empty macrocycle.







Abstract
This work presents a synergy between organic electronics and supramolecular chemistry, in which a host&#8211;guest complex is designed to function as an efficacious electronic material. Specifically, the noncovalent recognition of a fullerene, phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), by an alternating perylene diimide (P)&#8208;bithiophene (B) conjugated macrocycle (PBPB) results in a greater than five&#8208;fold enhancement in electron mobility, relative to the macrocycle alone. Characterization and quantification of the binding of fullerenes by host PBPB is provided alongside evidence for intermolecular electronic communication within the host&#8211;guest complexes.

      <title>Towards a Stronger Halogen Bond Involving Astatine: Unexpected Adduct with Bu3PO Stabilized by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>
Pushing the limits: Two distinct adducts between AtI and Bu3PO are experimentally and theoretically characterized in terms of equilibrium constants and molecular structures. Whereas the 1:1 adduct Bu3PO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AtI is bound by the strongest halogen bond so far with AtI, the 2:1 adduct 2Bu3PO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AtI displays one halogen bond plus two hydrogen bonds between the Bu3PO units.







Abstract
The halogen bond is a powerful tool for the molecular design and pushing the limits of its strength is of major interest. Bearing the most potent halogen&#8208;bond donor atom, astatine monoiodide (AtI) was recently successfully probed [Nat. Chem. 2018, 10, 428&#8211;434]. In this work, we continue the exploration of adducts between AtI and Lewis bases with the tributylphosphine oxide (Bu3PO) ligand, revealing the unexpected experimental occurrence of two distinct chemical species with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometries. The 1:1 Bu3PO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AtI complex is found to exhibit the strongest astatine&#8208;mediated halogen bond so far (with a formation constant of 10(4.24&#177;0.35)). Quantum chemical calculations unveil the intriguing nature of the 2:1 2Bu3PO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AtI adduct, involving a halogen bond between AtI and one Bu3PO molecular unit plus CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds chelating the second Bu3PO unit.

      <title>Radical C&#8722;N Borylation of Aromatic Amines Enabled by a Pyrylium Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>
A radical borylation of aromatic amines through a homolytic C(sp2)&#8722;N bond cleavage is presented. This method capitalizes on a simple and mild activation via a pyrylium reagent (ScPyry&#8208;OTf) that primes the amino group for reactivity. The combination of terpyridine and a diboron reagent triggers a radical reaction which cleaves the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond and forges a new C(sp2)&#8722;B bond. The non&#8208;planar structure of the pyridinium, provides the necessary driving force for the challenging aryl radical formation.

The unique non&#8208;planar structure of the pyridinium intermediate, provides the necessary driving force for the aryl radical formation. The method permits borylation of a wide variety of aromatic amines indistinctively of the electronic environment.

      <title>KNiB4O6F3: A Layered Fluorooxoborate with Charge&#8208;Oriented Ordering</title>
      <dc:description>
Order, order: A new fluoroborate, KNiB4O6F3, contains a new (B4O9F3)9&#8722; group and shows a charge&#8208;oriented ordering with a high (positive charge) to high (negative charge) and low to low coordination manner.







Abstract
A layered fluorooxoborate, KNiB4O6F3, contains a new (B4O6F4)4&#8722; group built of one planar (BO3)3&#8722; triangle and three tetrahedral (BO3F)4&#8722; units. Those units are joined together by sharing the oxygen atoms to form a 2&#8208;dimensinal (BO3/2F)3BO3/2)&#8734; layer. K+ and Ni2+ occupy on the sides with F&#8722; and O2&#8722; of the (BO3/2F)3BO3/2)&#8734; layer with a high (positive charge) to high (negative charge) and low to low coordination. Such kind of charge&#8208;oriented ordering is found to be governed by the stabilization energy of Coulomb interaction of the cations in certain sites. It is hoped that this mechanism of ordering may provide an additional tool for designing new structures with favourable properties, such as ferroelectrics or nonlinear optical materials.

      <title>Towards atomically precise supported catalysts from monolayer&#8208;protected clusters: the critical role of the support</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the size and uniformity of metal clusters with atomic precision is essential for fine&#8208;tuning their catalytic properties, however for clusters deposited on supports such control is challenging. Here, by combining X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that supports play a crucial role in the evolution of monolayer&#8208;protected clusters into catalysts.

      <title>BaP6N10NH:Eu2+ as a Case Study&#8211;An Imidonitridophosphate Showing Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 4&#8197;GPa and 1150&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was determined from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Doping of the title compound with Eu2+ leads to unprecedented observation of luminescence from a Eu2+&#8208;doped imidonitridophosphate.







Abstract
Barium imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized at 5&#8197;GPa and 1000&#8201;&#176;C with a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique. Ba(N3)2, P3N5 and NH4Cl were used as starting materials, applying a combination of azide and mineralizer routes. The structure elucidation of BaP6N10NH (P63, a=7.5633(11), c=8.512(2)&#8197;&#197;, Z=2) was performed by a combination of transmission electron microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Phase purity was verified by Rietveld refinement. 1H and 31P solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy are consistent with the structure model. The chemical composition was confirmed by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and CHNS analyses. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of BaP6N10NH show blue emission upon excitation with UV to blue light (&#955;em=460&#8197;nm, fwhm=2423&#8197;cm&#8722;1) representing unprecedented Eu2+&#8208;luminescence of an imidonitride.

      <title>Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;Azaproline Creates Conformationally Adaptable Proline Derivatives for pH&#8208;Responsive Collagen Triple Helices</title>
      <dc:description>
Swings both ways: Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;azaproline creates pH&#8208;responsive amino acids that change their conformation in different chemical environments through the invertibility of nitrogen. Incorporation into collagen triple helices highlighted the conformational flexibility of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline and demonstrated its potential as a novel apparatus for the functionalization of peptides and proteins.







Abstract
C&#947;&#8208;substituted proline derivatives are valuable tools for developing functionalized collagen peptides for biological and materials investigations, yet the stereochemistry at C&#947; can produce undesired steric or stereoelectronic constraints. Alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline (&#947;&#8208;azPro) derivatives are proline mimetics that lack a stereogenic center at the &#947;&#8208;position of the ring and can thus utilize the invertibility of nitrogen to adapt their conformation. NMR spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations highlighted how alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro derivatives are conformationally dynamic and adopt conformational preferences through ring pucker flip along with nitrogen inversion. Lastly, incorporation of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro into collagen peptides produced functionalized pH&#8208;responsive triple helices with similar thermal stabilities, regardless of their placement in the Xaa or Yaa position within the characteristic Xaa&#8208;Yaa&#8208;Gly repeating unit of collagen peptides.

      <title>A Maltol&#8208;Containing Ruthenium Polypyridyl Complex as a Potential Anticancer Agent
</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium versus platinum: The synthesis and characterisation of the potential chemotherapeutic agent [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) (DIP=4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline, mal=maltol) is described. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that the compound has higher activity than cisplatin. It is efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affects the mitochondrial metabolism.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Chemotherapy, despite its severe side effects, is to date one of the leading strategies against cancer. Metal&#8208;based drugs present several potential advantages when compared to organic compounds and they have gained trust from the scientific community after the approval on the market of the drug cisplatin. Recently, we reported the ruthenium complex ([Ru(DIP)2(sq)](PF6) (where DIP is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline and sq is semiquinonate) with a remarkable potential as chemotherapeutic agent against cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we analyse a structurally similar compound, namely [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), carrying the flavour&#8208;enhancing agent approved by the FDA, maltol (mal). To possess an FDA approved ligand is crucial for a complex, whose mechanism of action might include ligand exchange. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), its stability in solutions and under conditions that resemble the physiological ones, and its in&#8208;depth biological investigation. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines in 2D model and on HeLa MultiCellular Tumour Spheroids (MCTS) demonstrated that our compound has higher activity than cisplatin, inspiring further tests. [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) was efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affected the mitochondrial metabolism.

      <title>Structure and Bonding in a Diamond&#8208;Shaped Tin Cluster Possessing a cyclo&#8208;Sn4 Core</title>
      <dc:description>A tetrameric cluster composed entirely of (aryl)Sn units, [DMPSn]  4  (DMP = 2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl), has been prepared by reduction of [DMPSnCl]  2  with a variety of reductants. This cluster was characterized in solution by multinuclear NMR spectroscopies, as well as in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This species is stereochemically nonrigid in solution and possesses a folded  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core that undergoes rapid ring&#8208;flipping at higher temperatures. The solid&#8208;state molecular structure is remarkably unsymmetrical and possesses a nearly planar  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core. The DMP substituents are arranged such that three are approximately coplanar, while one is nearly perpendicular to the  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core. Density functional theory calculations for a [PhSn]  4  model system show that this distorted geometry about the  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core maximizes &#963;&#8208;bonding between the Sn centers in a manner reminiscent of  trans  &#8208;bent bonding in the heavy group 14 analogues of alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

This species is stereochemically nonrigid in solution and possesses a folded  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core that undergoes rapid ring&#8208;flipping at higher temperatures. The solid&#8208;state molecular structure is remarkably unsymmetrical and possesses a nearly planar  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core. The DMP substituents are arranged such that three are approximately coplanar, while one is nearly perpendicular to the  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core. Density functional theory calculations for a [PhSn]  4  model system show that this distorted geometry about the  cyclo  &#8208;Sn  4  core maximizes &#963;&#8208;bonding between the Sn centers in a manner reminiscent of  trans  &#8208;bent bonding in the heavy group 14 analogues of alkenes and alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multi&#8208;color fluorescent carbon dots: Non&#8208;size effect dominate graphitized sp2 conjugated domain and surface state energy level co&#8208;modulate band&#8208;gap</title>
      <dc:description>Four types of carbon dots with various color (blue, green, yellow and red) emissions have been synthesized under solvent&#8208;free condition from citric acid and different nitrogen sources (DMF, urea, ethanamide and formamide). By detailed characterization and comparion, it is comfimed that the graphitized sp2  conjugated domain and surface functional groups such as C&#8208;O and C=N play synergitic roles in adujusting fluorescence properties. Notable, the size effect is not the dominant mechanism to achieve multi&#8208;color fluorescence emissions in our work. The structural configuration of carbon dots further influences the energy band structure, as demonstrated in simplified energy level diagrams. An absorption peak ~560nm appears in visible light area for red&#8208;emitting f&#8208;CDs, assigned to n&#8594;&#960;* transition of aromatic structure, thus introducing a new surface state energy level, resulting in reducing the energy of electron transition and the expanding visible region in UV&#8208;vis spectrum. Taking advantage of diverse absorption and emission properties, different CDs/TiO2  binary composites are obtained for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes, and it is found that absorption range in visible light and the band&#8208;gap of carbon dots make a difference with the photocatalytic performance of the composites.</dc:description>

      <title>Yldiide Ligands as Building Blocks for Polynuclear Coinage Metal Complexes: Metal Squares, Triangles and Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Yldiides have unique electronic properties and donor abilities, but as ligands in transition metal complexes they are scarcely represented in the literature. Here, the controlled synthesis of a series of polynuclear gold yldiide complexes derived from triphenyl(cyanomethyl)phosphonium bromide, [Ph 3  PCH 2  CN]Br, under mild conditions is described. Anionic dinuclear NBu4  [(AuX) 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] (X = Cl, C 6  F 5  ) or trinuclear derivatives NBu 4  [Au 3  X 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] bearing terminal chloride or pentafluorophenyl groups and bridging yldiide ligands have been prepared. These compounds evolve in solution giving rise to the formation of an unprecedented tetrameric gold cluster, [Au 4  {C(CN)PPh 3  } 4  ], by the loss of the gold complex NBu 4  [AuX 2  ]. This gold cluster can also be prepared in high yield by a transmetallation reaction from the analogous tetrameric silver cluster, and two geometric isomers have been characterised, their formation dependent on the synthetic route. The  ligand has also been used to build different dinuclear and trinuclear cationic complexes bearing phosphine or diphosphine ancillary ligands and bridging yldiide moieties. Further coordination through the cyano group of the yldiide ligand gives heterometallic trinuclear or pentanuclear derivatives. Structural characterisation of many of these compounds reveals the presence of complex molecular systems stabilised by gold&#183;&#183;&#183;gold interactions and bridging yldiide ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly methyl methacrylate&#8208;assisted exfoliation of graphite and its use in acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites</title>
      <dc:description>One of the applications of graphene in which its scalable production is of utmost importance is the development of polymer composites. Among the techniques used to produce graphene flakes, the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite stands out due to its versatility and scalability. However, the solvents suitable for the LPE process are generally toxic and have a high boiling point, making the processing challenging. The use of low boiling point solvents could be convenient for the processing, due to the easiness of their removal.
In this study, we propose the use of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a stabilizing agent for the production of graphene flakes in a low boiling point solvent,  i.e.,  acetone. The graphene dispersions produced in the mixture acetone&#8208;PMMA increases the concentration by +175&#160;%, and contain a higher percentage of few&#8209;layer graphene flakes (&lt;&#160;5&#160;layers)  , e.g.,  +60&#160;%, compared to the dispersions prepared in acetone. The as&#8208;produced graphene dispersions are used to develop graphene/acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites. The mechanical properties of the pristine polymer are improved,  i.e  ., +&#160;22&#160;% in the Young&#8217;s modulus, by adding 0.01&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes. Moreover, a decrease of ~&#160;20&#160;% in the oxygen permeability is obtained using 0.1&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes filler, compared to the unloaded matrix.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfonated Pyrene as a Photoregulator for Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Looping</title>
      <dc:description>
Loop&#8208;control system: The water&#8208;soluble sulfonated pyrene derivative SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator for the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). By observing the formation rate of the SPy dimer radical cation after photoionization, the looping kinetics of doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNA was revealed. Reducing the SPy dimer radical cation makes it possible to realize controlled unlooping.







Abstract
Controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules through photoregulators holds great promise as a spatiotemporally controllable tool for disease control. In addition, introducing photoregulators into biomolecules has also found applications in constructing smart nanomaterials. In spite of the astonishing advances that have been made in the past few years, realizing highly controllable and efficient regulation over the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions is still challenging. Herein, sulfonated pyrene SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator to control the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in aqueous solution. Due to its water solubility, SPy merits use in the study of biomolecules in aqueous solution. The looping of the doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNAs is stimulated by irradiation and regulated by SPy. Photoionization generates the radical cation of SPy (SPy.+). The association of SPy.+ with its neutral counterpart, SPy, gives rise to the dimer radical cation of SPy (SPy2.+). During the association process, the stabilization energy released to form SPy2.+ provides a driving force for the looping of ssDNAs. Conversely, the formed loop conformations were trapped by the formation of SPy2.+, and this allowed the looping dynamics to be investigated. The results reported herein suggest potential of SPy as a photoregulator for controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing with an Aptamer&#8208;Containing DNA Primer</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosensors: We demonstrate the ability to detect protein targets in solution and on paper&#8208;based sensors using a target&#8208;binding aptamer as a primer for rolling circle amplification (RCA). Binding of the target protein to the aptamer prevents the aptamer from binding a circular templet, inhibiting the initiation of the RCA process, which can be followed using a simple fluorescence assay (see figure).







Abstract
We report a method to detect proteins via suppression of rolling circle amplification (RCA) by using an appropriate aptamer as the linear primer (denoted as an aptaprimer) to initiate RCA. In the absence of a protein target, the aptaprimer is free to initiate RCA, which can produce long DNA products that are detected via binding of a fluorescent intercalating dye. Introduction of a target causes the primer region within the aptamer to become unavailable for binding to the circular template, inhibiting RCA. Using SYBR Gold or QuantiFluor dyes as fluorescent probes to bind to the RCA reaction product, it is possible to produce a generic protein&#8208;modulated RCA assay system that does not require fluorophore&#8208; or biotin&#8208;modified DNA species, substantially reducing complexity and cost of reagents. Based on this modulation of RCA, we demonstrate the ability to produce both solution and paper&#8208;based assays for rapid and quantitative detection of proteins including platelet derived growth factor and thrombin.

      <title>A Gold(I) Complex Containing an Oleanolic Acid Derivative as a Potential Anti&#8208;Ovarian&#8208;Cancer Agent by Inhibiting TrxR and Activating ROS&#8208;Mediated ERS
</title>
      <dc:description>
Au versus OC: A gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer (OC) cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzyme activity to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediates ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, it inhibits xenograft OC tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.







Abstract
Many cancer cells critically rely on antioxidant systems for cell survival and are vulnerable to further oxidative impairment triggered by agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the classical design and development of inhibitors that target antioxidant defense enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) can be a promising anticancer strategy. Herein, it is shown that a gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative (4&#8201;b) induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer A2780 cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It can inhibit TrxR enzyme activity to elevate ROS, mediate ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, this complex inhibits A2780 xenograft tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.

      <title>Solid&#8208;State Dynamics and High&#8208;Pressure Studies of a Supramolecular Spiral Gear</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular gears: The solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature and pressure by a combination of non&#8208;ambient XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The structures and solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the general formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (where DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature (from 100 to 360&#8197;K) and pressure (up to 3.4&#8197;GPa), through the combination of variable&#8208;temperature and variable&#8208;pressure XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The two salts are isomorphous and crystallize in the enantiomeric space groups P3221 and P3121. All building blocks composing the supramolecular complex display dynamic processes at ambient temperature and pressure. It has been demonstrated that the motion of the crown ethers is maintained on lowering the temperature (down to 100&#8197;K) or on increasing the pressure (up to 1.5&#8197;GPa) thanks to the correlation between neighboring molecules, which mesh and rotate in a concerted manner similar to spiral gears. Above 1.55&#8197;GPa, a collapse&#8208;type transition to a lower&#8208;symmetry ordered structure, not attainable at a temperature of 100&#8197;K, takes place, proving, thus, that the pressure acts as the means to couple and decouple the gears. The relationship between temperature and pressure effects on molecular motion in the solid state has also been discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structures and solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the general formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;DABCOH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](X)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) have been investigated as a function of temperature (from 100 to 360&#8197;K) and pressure (up to 3.4&#8197;GPa), through the combination of variable&#8208;temperature and variable&#8208;pressure XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The two salts are isomorphous and crystallize in the enantiomeric space groups &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. All building blocks composing the supramolecular complex display dynamic processes at ambient temperature and pressure. It has been demonstrated that the motion of the crown ethers is maintained on lowering the temperature (down to 100&#8197;K) or on increasing the pressure (up to 1.5&#8197;GPa) thanks to the correlation between neighboring molecules, which mesh and rotate in a concerted manner similar to spiral gears. Above 1.55&#8197;GPa, a collapse&#8208;type transition to a lower&#8208;symmetry ordered structure, not attainable at a temperature of 100&#8197;K, takes place, proving, thus, that the pressure acts as the means to couple and decouple the gears. The relationship between temperature and pressure effects on molecular motion in the solid state has also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards the Sarpagine&#8208;Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Family of Indole Alkaloids: Enantioselective Synthesis of an N&#8208;Demethyl Alstolactone Diastereomer</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic methods: Transannular cyclization is a key step for the formation of azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a common structural motif found in the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of natural products (see scheme).







Abstract
the strategy involving the use of functionalized tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;cycloocta[b]indol&#8208;6&#8208;one is reported as a key intermediate for synthesis of members of the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The desired tricycle was synthesized through the following key steps: 1)&#8197;Evans&#8217; syn&#8208;selective aldolization; 2)&#8197;Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl cross&#8208;coupling using the phenylthiol ester of 3&#8208;chloropropanoic acid as a surrogate of acrylic thioester for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles; and 3)&#8197;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) for the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring. An N&#8208;allylation followed by intramolecular 1,4&#8208;addition was planned for synthesis of the vobasine class of natural products. However, attempted cyclizations under a diverse set of conditions involving anionic, radical, and organopalladium/organonickel species failed to produce the bridged ring system. On the other hand, esterification of the pendant primary alcohol function with acetoacetic acid, followed by intramolecular Michael addition, afforded the desired tetracycle with excellent diastereoselectivity. Subsequent functional group manipulation and transannular cyclization of the amino alcohol afforded the N(1)&#8208;demethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;alstolactone. We believe that the same synthetic route would afford the alstolactone should the amino alcohol with appropriate stereochemistry be used as the starting material.

      <title>Defluoroalkylation of sp3 C&#8722;F Bonds of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it simple! A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones (see scheme).







Abstract
A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones. The reaction sequence allows construction of a new C&#8722;C bond in a highly selective manner from a single sp3 C&#8722;F bond of a CF3 group in the presence of sp2 C&#8722;F bonds. The scope incorporates industrially relevant fluorocarbons including HFO&#8208;1234yf and HFO&#8208;1234ze. No catalyst, additives or transition metals are required, rather the methodology relies on a recently developed boron reagent. Remarkably, the boron site of this reagent plays a dual role in the reaction sequence, being nucleophilic at boron in the C&#8722;F cleavage step (SN2&#8217;) but electrophilic at boron en route to the carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming step (SE2&#8217;). The duplicitous behaviour is underpinned by a hydrogen atom migration from boron to the carbon atom of a carbene ligand.

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the barrel: The formation of H&#8208;aggregates for an 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI)&#8208;containing organogelator enhances the fluorescence quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, a new record for HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system.







Abstract
To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI), in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f=2.9 vs. 0.02&#8201;%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Structural Elucidation of Silver(I) Amides and Their Application as Catalysts in the Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Carbonyls</title>
      <dc:description>
The allure of silver: Utilizing monomeric silver(I) amides as molecular defined pre&#8208;catalysts, the first silver&#8208;mediated hydroboration of a range of aldehydes and ketones has been achieved. Catalytic hydrosilylation of carbonyls has also shown success employing Ph2SiH2. Both mechanisms are proposed to proceed via a &#8216;AgH&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
This study details the isolation and characterisation of three novel silver(I) amides in solution and solid&#8208;state, [Ag(Cy3P)(HMDS)] 2, [Ag(Cy3P){N(TMS)(Dipp)}] 3 and [Ag(Cy3P)2(NPh2)] 4. Their catalytic abilities have proved successful in hydroboration and hydrosilylation reactions with a full investigation performed with complex&#8197;2. Both protocols proceed under mild conditions, displaying exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance and chemoselectivity, in excellent conversions at competitive reaction times. This work reveals the first catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones performed by a silver(I) catalyst.

      <title>Highly Polarized Coumarin Derivatives Revisited: Solvent&#8208;controlled Competition Between Proton Coupled Electron Transfer and Twisted Intramolecular Electron Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Linking a polarized coumarin unit with an aromatic substituent via an amide bridge results in weak electronic coupling affecting the intramolecular electron transfer (ET) process. As a result of this, interesting solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical properties can be observed. In polar solvents, electron transfer in coumarin derivatives of this type induces a mutual twist of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting molecular units (TICT process) that opens radiationless decay processes (internal conversion). In the dyad with the strongest intramolecular hydrogen bond, the planar form is stabilized so twisting can only occur in highly polar solvents, whereas fast proton coupled electron transfer (PCET process) occurs in non&#8208;polar n&#8208;alkanes. The kPCET rate constant decreases linearly with the fluorescence maximum energy in different solvents. This observation is explained in terms of competition between electron and proton transfer from a highly polarized (~15 D) and fluorescent locally&#8208;excited (1LE) state to a much less polarized (~4 D) charge&#8208;transfer (1CT) state, a unique occurrence. Photophysical measurements performed for a family of related coumarin dyads together with results of quantum&#8208;chemical computations give insight into the mechanism of the ET process which is followed by either a TICT or PCET process. Our results reveal that dielectric solvation of the excited state slows down the PCET process, even in non&#8208;polar solvents.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Divergent Catalysis Using a Bench&#8208;Stable Cobalt(I) Hydride Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Night and day: A rare example of switching product outcome depending on light&#8208;dark is reported. Using a cobalt(I) hydride complex, hydroborated products are obtained under visible&#8208;light irradiation whereas, in contrast, alkene isomerisation occurs in the dark. This dual&#8208;function catalysis results from alteration of the coordination sphere surrounding the metal centre.







Abstract
While the use of visible light in conjunction with transition metal catalysis offers powerful opportunities to switch between on/&#8208;off states of catalytic activity, the next frontier would be the ability to switch the actual function of the catalyst and resulting products. Here we report such an example of multi&#8208;dimensional catalysis. Featuring an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable cobalt(I) hydride complex in conjunction with pinacolborane, we can switch the reaction outcome between two widely employed transformations, olefin migration and hydroboration, with visible light as the trigger.

      <title>Room Temperature Coupling of Aryldiazoacetates with Boronic Acids Enhanced by Blue Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Lights on! A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Mechanistic studies including control experiments, DFT calculations and reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring; as well as synthetic applications have been performed showcasing a rich panorama of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photochemical protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Except for a few cases, the room temperature coupling in the dark (thermal process) generally does not work. When it does, it is likely to also involve free carbenes as key intermediates. Alternatively, photochemical reactions show a broad scope, can be performed under air and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups. Reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring, DFT calculations and control experiments have been used to evaluate the main aspects of this intricate mechanistic scenario. Biologically active molecules Adiphenine, Benactyzine and Aprophen have been prepared as examples of synthetic applications.

      <title>Efficient Fused Ring Extension of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type Nonfullerene Acceptors via Symmetric Replicating Core Unit Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Extension of a fused aromatic ring core is beneficial for enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer and effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation in A&#8208;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). In this work, a novel strategy involving extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetrically replicating core unit was developed, and a novel symmetric fused&#8208;12&#8208;ring NFA, LC81 was synthesized. When paired with the wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PBT1&#8208;C, the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs) showed a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.71%, much higher than that of the device based on reference NFA, TPTT&#8208;4F. Moreover, the LC81&#8208;based OSC displayed a lower energy loss and a better ambient stability than the TPTT&#8208;4F&#8208;based device. Our results indicate that the extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetric replicating core unit is an effective strategy for promoting photovoltaic characteristics of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The increasing demand of high&#8208;performance crystalline oxide nanomaterials for applications in current and emergent technologies is pushing research on alternative and sustainable synthesis processes, ideally complying with the principles of Green Chemistry. In this framework, wet&#8208;chemistry approaches are particularly promising, since they are typically based on soft synthesis processes, in terms of temperature and pressure, or use water and/or non&#8208;toxic alcohols as solvents.

Using low temperatures for the preparation of a nanomaterial or of a nanostructured thin film does not necessarily imply sacrificing crystallinity and compositional purity of the obtained sample.

      <title>Hydroboration of alkenes catalysed by a nickel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex: reaction and mechanistic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The pentamethylcyclopentadienyl N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel complex [Ni(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Cl(IMes)] (IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) efficiently catalyses the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes with catecholborane in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide, and joins the very exclusive club of nickel catalysts for this important transformation. Interestingly, the regioselectivity can be reversed in some cases by using pinacolborane instead of catecholborane. Mechanistic investigations involving control experiments,  1  H and  11  B NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, piezometric measurements and DFT calculations suggest an initial reduction of the Ni(II) precursor to a Ni(I) active species with the concomitant release of H  2  . The crucial role of the alkoxo&#8208;catecholato&#8208;borohydride species resulting from the reaction of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide with catecholborane in the formation of an intermediate nickel&#8208;hydride species that would then be reduced a Ni(I) active species, is highlighted.</dc:description>

The crucial role of the alkoxo&#8208;catecholato&#8208;borohydride species resulting from the reaction of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide with catecholborane in the formation of an intermediate nickel&#8208;hydride species that would then be reduced a Ni(I) active species, is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Manipulation of the Coordination Geometry along the C4 Rotation Axis in a Dinuclear Tb3+ Triple&#8208;Decker Complex via a Supramolecular Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Switchable SMMs: The magnetic relaxation behavior of a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) could be controlled by selectively changing the coordination environment in the neutral state using a supramolecular approach. By controlling the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 axis in the Tb&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes, switchable SMMs are possible.







Abstract
A supramolecular complex (1&#8901;C60) was prepared by assembling (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) with the dinuclear Tb3+ triple&#8208;decker complex [(TPP)Tb(Pc)Tb(TPP)] (1: Tb3+=trivalent terbium ion, Pc2&#8722;=phthalocyaninato, TPP2&#8722;=tetraphenylporphyrinato) with quasi&#8208;D4h symmetry to investigate the relationship between the coordination symmetry and single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) properties. Tb3+&#8208;Pc triple&#8208;decker complexes (Tb2Pc3) have an important advantage over Tb3+&#8208;Pc double&#8208;decker complexes (TbPc2) since the magnetic relaxation processes correspond to the Zeeman splitting when there are two 4f spin systems. The two Tb3+ sites of 1 are equivalent, and the twist angle (&#966;) was determined to be 3.62&#176;. On the other hand, the two Tb3+ sites of 1&#8901;C60 are not equivalent. The &#966; values for sites Tb1 and Tb2 were determined to be 3.67&#176; and 33.8&#176;, respectively, due to a change in the coordination symmetry of 1 upon association with C60. At 1.8&#8197;K, 1 and 1&#8901;C60 undergo different magnetic relaxations, and the changes in the ground state affect the spin dynamics. Although 1 and 1&#8901;C60 relax via QTM in a zero applied magnetic field (H), H dependencies of the magnetic relaxation times (&#964;) for H&gt;1500&#8197;Oe are similar. On the other hand, for H&lt;1500&#8197;Oe, the &#964; values have different behaviors since the off&#8208;diagonal terms (
) affect the magnetic relaxation mechanism. From temperature (T) and H dependences of &#964;, spin&#8208;phonon interactions along with direct and Raman mechanisms explain the spin dynamics. We believe that a supramolecular method can be used to control the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 rotation axis and the spin dynamic properties in dinuclear Ln3+&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes.

      <title>Boosting visible&#8208;light photocatalytic redox reaction by charge separation in SnO2/ZnSe(N2H4)0.5 heterojunction nanocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report environmental photocatalysts with attractive catalytic properties prepared by introducing SnO  2  quantum dots (QDs) directly attached onto ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  substrates to induce advantageous charge separation. The SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  nanocomposites could be easily synthesized  via  a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal process.

Moreover, the addition of a specified amount of SnO  2  boosted the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity; however, the presence of excess SnO  2  QDs in the substrate resulted in aggregation and deteriorated the performance. The spectroscopic data revealed that the SnO  2  QDs act as a photocatalytic mediator and enhance the charge separation within the type&#8208;II band alignment system of the SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  heterojunction photocatalysts.

      <title>Collective Effects of Electron Affinity and Steric Hindrance of Trifluoromethyl on the &#960;&#8208;Bridge in Designing Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>To explore the correlation of the electron affinity of acceptor and the molecular conformation to the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) feature, a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules were designed and synthesized with triazine (Trz) as acceptor (A) and carbazole (Cz) or tert&#8208;butylcarbazole (BuCz) as donor (D). On the phenylene bridge between D and A, methyl or trifluoromethyl was incorporated close either to D or to A to tune the molecular conformation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor. Both the twist angles and the singlet and triplet energy difference (&#916;  E  ST  ) were observed strongly dependent on the type and position of the substituent on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. Only those molecules with trifluoromethyl locating close to the D side, namely TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  , exhibit TADF feature, verifying that both sufficient electron affinity of the A unit and large dihedral angle between D and the &#960;&#8208;bridge are necessary to ensure the occurance of TADF. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  achieved external quantum efficiencies of 9.40% and 14.22% with CIE coordinates of (0.19, 0.23) and (0.18, 0.29) respectively. This study provides practical design strategy for blue TADF materials particularly when planar and less crowded group is used as donor.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To explore the correlation of the electron affinity of acceptor and the molecular conformation to the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) feature, a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules were designed and synthesized with triazine (Trz) as acceptor (A) and carbazole (Cz) or tert&#8208;butylcarbazole (BuCz) as donor (D). On the phenylene bridge between D and A, methyl or trifluoromethyl was incorporated close either to D or to A to tune the molecular conformation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor. Both the twist angles and the singlet and triplet energy difference (&#916;  E  ST  ) were observed strongly dependent on the type and position of the substituent on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. Only those molecules with trifluoromethyl locating close to the D side, namely TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  , exhibit TADF feature, verifying that both sufficient electron affinity of the A unit and large dihedral angle between D and the &#960;&#8208;bridge are necessary to ensure the occurance of TADF. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  achieved external quantum efficiencies of 9.40% and 14.22% with CIE coordinates of (0.19, 0.23) and (0.18, 0.29) respectively. This study provides practical design strategy for blue TADF materials particularly when planar and less crowded group is used as donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The CH&#8208;&#960; interaction in protein &#8211; carbohydrate binding: Bioinformatics and in vitro quantification</title>
      <dc:description>The molecular recognition of carbohydrates by proteins plays a key role in many biological processes including immune response, pathogen entry into a cell and cell&#8208;cell adhesion (e.g., in cancer metastasis). Carbohydrates interact with proteins mainly through hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated interaction and non&#8208;polar dispersion interactions. The role of dispersion&#8208;driven CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (stacking) in protein&#8208;carbohydrate recognition has been underestimated for a long time considering&#160;&#160;the polar interactions to be the main forces for saccharide interactions.&#160;&#160;However, over the last few years it turns out that non&#8208;polar interactions are equally important. In this study we analyzed the CH&#8208;&#960; interactions employing bioinformatics (data mining, structural analysis), several experimental (ITC, X&#8208;ray crystallography) and computational techniques. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been used as a source of structural data. PDB contains over 12 000 protein complexes with carbohydrates.&#160;&#160;Stacking interactions are very frequently present in such complexes (about 39% of identified structures). The calculations and the ITC measurement results suggest that the CH&#8208;&#960; stacking contribution to the overall binding energy ranges from 4 kcal/mol up to 8 kcal/mol. All the results show that the stacking CH&#8208;&#960; interactions in protein&#8208;carbohydrate complexes can be considered to be a driving force of the binding in such&#160;&#160;complexes.</dc:description>

Unusual spin&#8208;crossover features of [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]+: The series of compounds [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=a halogen substituent) exhibit 50&#8201;% spin crossover with a broad [HS&#8208;LS] plateau, a magnetic profile hitherto not crystallographically elucidated within the FeIII&#8208;salRen family (R=alkyl group).

Abstract
X&#8208;ray structures of the halo&#8208;substituted complexes [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) [salMeen=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)salicylaldiminate]at RT have revealed the presence of two discrete HS complex cations in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with two perchlorate counter ions linking them by N&#8722;Hamine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Operchlorate interactions. At 90&#8197;K, the two complex cations are distinctly HS and LS, a rare crystallographic observation of this coexistence in the FeIII&#8208;salRen (R=alkyl) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) system. At both temperatures, crystal packing shows dimerization through C&#8722;Himine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ophenolate interactions, a key feature for SCO cooperativity. Moreover, there are noncovalent contacts between the complex cations through type&#8208;II halogen&#8208;halogen bonds, which are novel in this system. The magnetic profiles and M&#246;ssbauer spectra concur with the structural analyses and reveal 50&#8201;% SCO of the type [HS&#8208;HS]&#8596;[HS&#8208;LS] with a broad plateau. In contrast, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]BPh4&#8901;2MeOH is LS and exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition, exemplifying the influence of lattice solvents and counter ions on SCO.

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Olefination of Sterically Demanding Benzamides: Application to the Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzamides</title>
      <dc:description>
An unsubstituted CpRhIII complex is a highly effective catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral benzamides (see scheme).







Abstract
It has been established that an unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRhIII) complex is a highly active catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of sterically demanding ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. This catalysis was successfully applied to the diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamides. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamide derivatives with high ee values.

      <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid catalyzed protocol has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted furan and thiophene derivatives from enaminones and enaminothiones. The [4+1] annulation allows for broad substrate scopes, high efficiency, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.







Abstract
Concise construction of furan and thiophene units has played an important role in the synthesis of potentially bioactive compounds and functional materials. Herein, an efficient Lewis acid ZnCl2 catalyzed [4+1] annulation of alkylthio&#8208;substituted enaminones is reported, that is, &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals with sulfur ylides to afford 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;aminofuran derivatives. In a similar fashion, [4+1] annulation of the corresponding enaminothiones, that is, &#945;&#8208;thioxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals, with sulfur ylides efficiently proceeded to give multisubstituted 3&#8208;aminothiophenes. This method features wide substrate scopes as well as broad functional group tolerance, offering a concise route to highly functionalized furans and thiophenes.

      <title>Molecular Engineering of Isomeric Benzofurocarbazole Donors for Photophysical Management of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning delayed fluorescence: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.







Abstract
Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, only 5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (34BFCz) has been reported and, to the best of our knowledge, no other benzofurocarbazole derivatives have been covered in the literature. In the present study, two further benzofurocarbazole moieties, 12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (12BFCz) and 7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (23BFCz), have been synthesized to investigate the effect of the donor structure on the photophysics and device parameters of TADF emitters. Two benzofurocarbazole&#8208;derived TADF emitters, 12&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (o12BFCzTrz) and 7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (o23BFCzTrz), have been compared with 5&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (oBFCzTrz). The benzofurocarbazole donor structure governs the TADF characteristics, such as charge&#8208;transfer property and emission color. The 12BFCz donor has proved to be effective in blue&#8208;shifting the emission color, and 34BFCz has proven useful for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The 12BFCz&#8208;derived o12BFCzTrz showed blue&#8208;shifted color coordinates of (0.159, 0.288), compared to (0.178, 0388) for o23BFCzTrz and (0.169, 0.341) for oBFCzTrz. The 34BFCz&#8208;derived oBFCzTrz exhibited an EQE of 22.9&#8201;%, compared to 19.2&#8201;% for o12BFCzTrz and 21.1&#8201;% for o23BFCzTrz.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuning delayed fluorescence&lt;/b&gt;: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.

Abstract
In pursuit of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities, porous LiFe0.4Mn0.6PO4/CNF free&#8208;standing electrodes have been successfully prepared through a facile ionic liquid (IL) assisted electrospinning method. Owing to the hierarchical porosity and N&#8208;doped carbon layer derived from the ionic liquid, the resulting electrodes exhibited superior electrochemical performances with an improvement of conductivity and pseudocapacitive contribution, delivering a discharge capability of 162.7, 133.5, 114.5, and 102.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current rates of 0.1, 1, 5, and 10&#8197;C, respectively. It is highly expected that this facile IL&#8208;assisted electrospinning method will lead to further developments for other phosphate&#8208;based free&#8208;standing electrodes, which offers a new route in designing polyanionic cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Metallacarboranes as Photoredox Catalysts in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst and photosensitizer: Cobaltabisdicarbollide [3,3&#8217;&#8208;Co(1,2&#8208;C2B9H11)2]&#8722; and its chloro derivatives are both efficient catalysts and photosensitizers for the photooxidation of alcohols in water through single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. This behavior is due to their high solubility in water, lack of photoluminescence, easy modification of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and high oxidizing power for the Co4+/3+ couple, among others. High performance is achieved with a catalyst loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metallacarboranes with the shape of the Greek letter &#952;, such as [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;, were tested, for the first time, as efficient photoredox catalysts in the oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols in water. Their efficiency is linked to their high solubility in water, their high oxidizing power (Co4+/3+), and their absence of fluorescence on excitation, among others. In most of the studied examples, using a catalyst load of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;% gave high yields of 90&#8211;95&#8201;% with selectivity greater than 99&#8201;%. By reducing the catalyst load to 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, quantitative conversion of reactants to products was achieved, in some cases with greater than 99&#8201;% yield, high catalyst efficiency reaching a turnover number of 10&#8201;000, and a higher yield with a 45 times lower concentration of catalyst. The metallacarboranes can be recovered easily by precipitation on addition of [NMe4]Cl. A pathway for the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of alcohols is proposed.

      <title>Evidence for Genuine Bimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Activation of Dihydrogen with Gold(I)/Platinum(0) Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Balance of power: A family of AuI/Pt0 systems activate H2 by a genuine frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, as demonstrated by a joint experimental/computational effort. These studies evinced that balancing the degree of frustration versus M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction has a strong impact on activation capacity, whereas subtle modifications on ligand sterics result in drastic changes in activity and product distribution.







Abstract
A joint experimental/computational effort to elucidate the mechanism of dihydrogen activation by a gold(I)/platinum(0) metal&#8208;only frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) is described herein. The drastic effects on H2 activation derived from subtle ligand modifications have also been investigated. The importance of the balance between bimetallic adduct formation and complete frustration has been interrogated, providing for the first time evidence for genuine metal&#8208;only FLP reactivity in solution. The origin of a strong inverse kinetic isotopic effect has also been clarified, offering further support for the proposed bimetallic FLP&#8208;type cleavage of dihydrogen.

      <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal Complexes in Selective Bond Formations Through Radical Pathways</title>
      <dc:description>
Mainly main group: Remarkable progress has been made in the synthesis and investigation of main&#8208;group metal complexes for radical reactions. This contribution highlights applications of such compounds for selective bond forming events in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions through radical pathways.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in radical reactions involving main&#8208;group metal complexes. This includes the isolation and detailed characterization of main&#8208;group metal radical compounds, but also the generation of highly reactive persistent or transient radical species. A rich arsenal of methods has been established that allows control over and exploitation of their unusual reactivity patterns. Thus, main&#8208;group metal compounds have entered the field of selective bond formations in controlled radical reactions. Transformations that used to be the domain of late transition&#8208;metal compounds have been realized, and unusual selectivities, high activities, as well as remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerances have been reported. Recent findings demonstrate the potential of main&#8208;group metal compounds to become standard tools of synthetic chemistry, catalysis, and materials science, when operating through radical pathways.

      <title>Boron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes: A Synthetic Tale from Borazine Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanographene doping: The preparation of borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines led to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation. A new boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery was isolated. Mechanistic studies on the reaction and evaluation of the doping effect on the optoelectronic properties are also reported.







Abstract
In this work, a comprehensive account of the authors&#8217; synthetic efforts to prepare borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines, bearing an ortho fluoride leaving group on each of the N&#8208; and B&#8208;aryl rings, was shown to lead to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation, giving higher yields of borazinocoronenes than those obtained with borazine precursors bearing fluoride leaving groups at the ortho positions of the B&#8208;aryl substituents. By using this pathway, an unprecedented boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery could be isolated, and its structure proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Mechanistic studies on the stepwise Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization suggest that the mechanism of the planarization reaction proceeds through extension of the &#960; system. To appraise the doping effect of the boroxadizine unit on the optoelectronic properties of topology&#8208;equivalent molecular graphenes, the all&#8208;carbon and pyrylium PAH analogues, all featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery, were also prepared. As already shown for the borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronene, the replacement of the central benzene ring by its B3N2O congener widens the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and dramatically enhances the fluorescence quantum yield.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Substitution of Aliphatic Alcohols Mediated by Sulfuryl Fluoride</title>
      <dc:description>
A method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is described. This new process is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using N, S, O, and C nucleophiles. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable, which was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification (see scheme).







Abstract
The Mitsunobu reaction is a powerful transformation for the one&#8208;pot activation and substitution of aliphatic alcohols. Significant efforts have focused on modifying the classic conditions to overcome problems associated with purification from phosphine&#8208;based byproducts. Herein, we report a phosphine free method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride. This new method is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using phthalimide, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;iminodicarboxylate, and aromatic thiol nucleophiles in 74&#8201;% average yield. Activated carbon nucleophiles and a deactivated phenol were also effective for this reaction in good yields. Secondary alcohols were also successful substrates using aryl thiols, affording the corresponding sulfides in 56&#8201;% average yield with enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable. This feature was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions enabled further in situ derivatization for the one&#8208;pot conversion of alcohols to amines or sulfones. This method also provides a boarder nucleophile scope compared to existing phosphine&#8208;free methods.

      <title>Efficient Screening for Ternary Molecular Ionic Cocrystals Using a Complementary Mechanosynthesis and Computational Structure Prediction Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot on predictions! The mechanosynthesis of ternary molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) with significantly different physicochemical properties has been achieved in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding. The crystal structures of the ICCs were successfully predicted by using computational methods. The results pave the way for the efficient screening of higher&#8208;order multicomponent crystal forms with functional properties (see figure).







Abstract
The discovery of molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) widens the opportunities for optimizing the physicochemical properties of APIs whilst facilitating the delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. However, ICCs are often observed serendipitously in crystallization screens and the factors dictating their crystallization are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that mechanochemical ball milling is a versatile technique for the reproducible synthesis of ternary molecular ICCs in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding with or without solvent. Computational crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations have been performed on ternary molecular ICCs for the first time and the observed crystal structures of all the ICCs were correctly predicted. Periodic dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that all the ICCs are thermodynamically stable (mean stabilization energy=&#8722;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) relative to the crystallization of a physical mixture of the binary salt and acid. The results suggest that a combined mechanosynthesis and CSP approach could be used to target the synthesis of higher&#8208;order molecular ICCs with functional properties.

      <title>Catalytic Platinum Nanoparticles Decorated with Subnanometer Molybdenum Clusters for Biomass Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
Development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals requires efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. This article demonstrates that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound.







Abstract
The development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals is hindered due to a lack of efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. Here we report that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters can efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound. In contrast with monometallic Mo catalysts that are inactive and monometallic Pt catalysts that have low activities and selectivities, bimetallic Pt&#8211;Mo catalysts exhibit synergistic effects with high activities and selectivities. The maximum activity occurs at a Pt to Mo molar ratio of three. Although Mo atoms themselves are catalytically inactive, they serve as preferential binding anchors for oxygen atoms while a catalytic transformation proceeds on neighboring surface Pt atoms. Beyond biomass processing, Pt&#8211;Mo nanoparticles are promising catalysts for a wide variety of reactions that require a transformation of molecules with an oxygen atom and, more broadly, in other fields of science and technology that require tuning of surface&#8211;oxygen interactions.

      <title>Active Metal Template Synthesis and Characterization of a Nanohoop [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
      <dc:description>Molecules and materials that demonstrate large amplitude responses to minor changes in their local environment play an important role in the development of new forms of nanotechnology. Molecular daisy chains are a type of a mechanically interlocked molecule that are particularly sensitive to such changes where, in the presence of certain stimuli, the molecular linkage enables muscle&#8208;like movement between a reduced&#8208;length contracted form and an increased&#8208;length expanded form.&#160; To date, all reported syntheses of molecular daisy chains are accomplished via passive&#8208;template methods, resulting in a majority of structures being switchable only through the addition of an exogenous stimuli such as metal ions or changes in pH.&#160; Here, we describe a new approach to these structural motifs that exploits a multi&#8208;component active&#8208;metal template synthesis to mechanically interlock two pi&#8208;rich nanohoop macrocycles into a molecular daisy chain which undergoes large conformational changes via thermal energy.</dc:description>

Molecular daisy chains are a type of a mechanically interlocked molecule that are particularly sensitive to such changes where, in the presence of certain stimuli, the molecular linkage enables muscle&#8208;like movement between a reduced&#8208;length contracted form and an increased&#8208;length expanded form.&#160; To date, all reported syntheses of molecular daisy chains are accomplished via passive&#8208;template methods, resulting in a majority of structures being switchable only through the addition of an exogenous stimuli such as metal ions or changes in pH.&#160; Here, we describe a new approach to these structural motifs that exploits a multi&#8208;component active&#8208;metal template synthesis to mechanically interlock two pi&#8208;rich nanohoop macrocycles into a molecular daisy chain which undergoes large conformational changes via thermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Extracellular matrix proteins involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and characterized by cognitive and memory impairments. Emerging evidence suggests that the extracellular matrix (ECM) biomacromolecules in brain plays an important role in etiology of AD. It has been detected that the levels of ECM proteins have been changed in the brains of AD patients and animal models. Some ECM components, e.g., elastin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are considered to promote the upregulation of extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) proteins. In addition, collagen VI and laminin are shown to have interactions with A&#946; peptides, which might lead to clearance of those peptides. Thus, ECM proteins are involved in both amyloidosis and neuroprotection in AD process. However, the molecular mechanism of neuronal ECM proteins on pathophysiology of AD remains elusive. More investigation of ECM proteins with AD pathogenesis is needed, and this may lead to novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for AD.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Diphenanthrioctaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0), an expanded carbaporphyrinoid incorporating two phenanthrenylene moieties, exists as two separate, yet interconvertible, locked stereoisomers.

      <title>Hetero Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with a Dicationic Urea Azine Derived Azo Dienophile and Their Use for the Synthesis of an Electron&#8208;Rich Pentacene</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the first hetero Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions with a stable, dicationic urea azine derived azo dienophile, synthesised by two&#8208;electron oxidation of the neutral urea azine. Several charged DA products were synthesised in good yield and fully characterised. The DA adduct of anthracene is in thermal equilibrium with the reactants at room temperature, and the reaction enthalpy and entropy were determined from the temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium constant. Furthermore, base addition to solutions of the pentacene DA product leads to deprotonation, cleavage of the N&#8208;N bond and formation of an electron&#8208;rich 6,13&#8208;bisguanidinyl&#8208;substituted pentacene. The redox and optical properties of this new pentacene derivative were studied. Furthermore, the dication resulting from its two&#8208;electron oxidation was synthesised and fully characterised.

The highly unusual release of the&#160; tert &#8208;butoxide ligand as &#160;t BuOH in the course of the reaction was observed. The formed alkylidene complexes and&#160;tBuOH are in an equilibrium with the NHC and the dialkyl complexes. Reaction kinetics were monitored by&#160;1H NMR. A correlation between the steric and electronic properties of the NHC and the reaction rates was observed. Kinetics of a deuterium&#8208;labeled complex in comparison to its non&#8208;deuterated counterpart revealed the presence of a strong primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 4.2, indicating that&#160; &#945; &#8208;H elimination is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Electro&#8208;olefination &#8208; a Catalyst Free&#160;Stereoconvergent Strategy for the Functionalization of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional methods carrying out C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) bond formations are typically mediated by transition&#8208;metal based catalysts. Herein, we conceptualize a complementary avenue to access such bonds by exploiting the potential of electrochemistry in combination with organoboron chemistry. We demonstrate a transition metal catalyst&#8208;free electrocoupling between (hetero)aryls and alkenes via readily available alkenyl&#8208;tri(hetero)aryl borate salts (ATBs) in a stereoconvergent fashion. This unprecedented transformation was investigated theoretically and experimentally and led to a library of functionalized alkenes. The concept was then carried further and applied to the synthesis of the natural product pinosylvin and the derivatization of the steroidal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) scaffold.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by Hybrid Streptavidin&#8208;Diiron Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Hybrid protein&#8208;organometallic catalysts are being explored for selective catalysis of a number of reactions, because they utilize the complementary strengths of proteins and of organometallic complex. Here, we present an artificial hydrogenase, StrepH2, built by incorporating a biotinylated [Fe&#8208;Fe] hydrogenase organometallic mimic within streptavidin. This strategy takes advantage of the remarkable strength and specificity of biotin&#8208;streptavidin recognition, which drives quantitative incorporation of the biotinylated diironhexacarbonyl center into streptavidin, as confirmed by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. FTIR spectra of StrepH2 show characteristic peaks at shift values indicative of interactions between the catalyst and the protein scaffold. StrepH2 catalyzes proton reduction to hydrogen in aqueous media during photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Under photocatalytic conditions, the protein&#8208;embedded catalyst shows enhanced efficiency and prolonged activity compared to the isolated catalyst. Transient absorption spectroscopy data suggest a mechanism for the observed increase in activity underpinned by an observed longer lifetime for the catalytic species Fe(I)Fe(0) when incorporated within streptavidin compared to the biotinylated catalyst in solution.</dc:description>

      <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of Internal and Terminal Alkenes via Remote Supramolecular Control</title>
      <dc:description>Regioselective catalytic transformations using supramolecular directing groups are increasingly popular as it allows for control over challenging reactions that may otherwise be impossible. In most examples the reactive group and the directing group are close to each other and/or the linker between the directing group is very rigid. Achieving control over the regioselectivity using a remote directing group with a flexible linker is significantly more challenging due to the large conformational freedom of such substrates. Herein, we report the redesign of a supramolecular Rh&#8208;bisphosphite hydroformylation catalyst containing a neutral carboxylate receptor (DIM pocket) with a larger distance between the phosphite metal binding moieties and the DIM pocket. For the first time regioselective conversion of internal and terminal alkenes containing a remote carboxylate directing group is demonstrated. For carboxylate substrates that possess an internal double bond at the &#916;&#8208;9 position regioselectivity is observed. As such, the catalyst was used to hydroformylate natural monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in a regioselective fashion, forming of an excess of the 10&#8208;formyl product (10&#8208;formyl/9&#8208;formyl product ratio of 2.51), which is the first report of a regioselective hydroformylation reaction of such substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery, synthesis and evaluation of a novel ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched&#8208;chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway, is a potential drug target for bacterial infections including  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  . Here, we have screened the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box against purified  M. tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI and identified two compounds that have K  i  values below 200 nM. In  Mt  cell susceptibility assays one of these compounds exhibited an IC  50  value of 0.8 &#956;M. Co&#8208;crystallization of this compound, 3&#8208;((methylsulfonyl)methyl)&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzo[  b  ][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;one (MMV553002), in complex with  Staphylococcus aureus  KARI, which has 56% identity with  Mt  KARI, NADPH and Mg  2+  yielded a structure to 1.72 &#197; resolution. However, only a hydrolyzed product of the inhibitor (  i.e.  3&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropanic acid, missing the 2&#8208;aminophenol attachment) is observed in the active site. Surprisingly,  Mt  cell susceptibility assays showed that the 2&#8208;aminophenol product is largely responsible for the anti&#8208;TB activity of the parent compound. Thus, we have identified 3&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropanic acid is a potent KARI inhibitor that could be further explored as a potential biocidal agent and we have shown 2&#8208;aminophenol, as an anti&#8208;TB drug lead, especially given it has low toxicity against human cells. The study highlights that careful analysis of broad screening assays is required to correctly interpret cell&#8208;based activity data.</dc:description>

Despite consisting of just 51 amino acids, insulin contains 17 of the proteinogenic amino acids, A&#8208; and B&#8208;chains, three disulfide bridges, and it folds with 3 a&#8208;helices and a short b&#8208;sheet segment. Insulin associates into dimers and further into hexamers with stabilization by Zn2+ and phenolic ligands. Selective chemical modification of proteins is at the forefront of developments in chemical biology and biopharmaceuticals. Insulin&#8217;s structure has made it amenable to organic and inorganic chemical reactions. This review provides a synthetic organic chemistry perspective on this small protein. It gives an overview of key chemical and physico&#8208;chemical aspects of the insulin molecule, with a focus on chemoselective reactions. This includes N&#8208;acylations at the N&#8208;termini or at LysB29 by pH control, introduction of protecting groups on insulin, binding of metal ions, ligands to control the nano&#8208;scale assembly of insulin, and more.</dc:description>

      <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electrochemical Properties and Electrode Kinetics of Na3V2(PO4)2O2F Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density</title>
      <dc:description>The phosphate cathode materials are practical in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high stability and long&#8208;term cycle life. In this work, temperature&#8208;dependent properties of phosphate cathode Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  2  O  2  F (abbr. NVPOF) are studied in a wide temperature range of &#8208;25 ~ 55&#176;C.

      <title>Playing with PtII and ZnII Coordination to Obtain Luminescent Metallomesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature mesomorphism was obtained for PtII and ZnII coordination complexes by playing with the coordination ability of a lipophilic gallate unit. The delicate balance between induction of mesomorphism and luminescence in condensed states is discussed (see figure).







Abstract
Blue&#8211;green luminescent terpyridine&#8208;containing PtII and ZnII complexes are reported. Equipped with lipophilic gallate units, which act as monodentate ancillary coordinating ligands and/or as anions, they display low&#8208;temperature mesomorphic properties (lamello&#8208;columnar and hexagonal mesophases for PtII and ZnII complexes, respectively). The mesomorphic properties were investigated by polarised optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X&#8208;ray scattering of bulk materials and oriented thin films. The model of self&#8208;assembly into the lamello&#8208;columnar phase of the PtII complex has been described in detail. The optical properties of the complexes were investigated in the liquid and condensed liquid crystalline states, highlighting the delicate balance between the role of the metal in determining the type of excited state responsible for the emission, and the role of the ancillary ligand in driving intermolecular interactions for proper mesophase formation.

      <title>Compressing a Non&#8208;Planar Aromatic Heterocyclic [7]Helicene to a Planar Hetero[8]Circulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting compressed: Non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core.







Abstract
This work describes a synthetic approach where a non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core. This [8]circulene consists of four benzene rings and four heterocyclic rings, and it is the first heterocyclic [8]circulene containing three different heteroatoms. The synthetic pathway proceeds via a the flattened dehydro&#8208;hetero[7]helicene, which is partially a helicene and partially a circulene: it is non&#8208;planar and helically chiral as helicenes, and contains a COT motif like [8]circulenes. The antiaromaticity of the COT core is confirmed by nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. The planarization from a helically &#960;&#8208;conjugated [7]helicene to a fully planar heterocyclic [8]circulene significantly alters the spectroscopic properties of the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalization of the [7]helicenes and the [8]circulenes by oxygenation of the thiophene rings to the corresponding thiophene&#8208;sulfones allows an almost complete fluorescence emission coverage of the visible region of the optical spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

Getting cagey: Iridium&#8208;catalyzed alkyne formal hydroboration with cage B(3,6)&#8722;H of o&#8208;carborane has been achieved, leading to the controlled synthesis of 3,6&#8208;trans&#8208;, 3&#8208;cis&#8208;, and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;alkenylated o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio and very good cis&#8211;trans selectivity.







Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal alkyne hydroboration with cage B&#8722;H of o&#8208;carborane has been achieved, leading to the controlled synthesis of a series of 3,6&#8208;[trans&#8208;(AlkCH=CH)]2&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (Alk=alkyl), 3&#8208;cis&#8208;(ArCH=CH)&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (Ar=aryl), and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;(ArCH=CH)&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;(AlkCH=CH)&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and very good cis&#8211;trans selectivity. The most electron&#8208;deficient B(3,6)&#8722;H vertices favor oxidative addition on electron&#8208;rich metal centers, which is responsible for the regioselectivity. On the other hand, the configuration of the resultant olefinic units is dominated by alkyne substituents. Alkyl groups lead to a trans&#8208;configuration whereas bulky aryl substitutions result in cis&#8208;configuration.

      <title>Hollow 3D Frame Structure Modified with NiCo2S4 Nanosheets and Spinous Fe2O3 Nanowires as Electrode Materials for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid construction: A 3D asymmetric supercapacitor system constructed from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and nanospinous Fe2O3 on hollow melamine foam/polypyrrole (MF/PPY) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, is reported. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an extended operation voltage window and good cycling stability (see figure).







Abstract
Supercapacitors have attracted tremendous research interest, since they are expected to achieve battery&#8208;level energy density, while having a long calendar life and short charging time. Herein, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor has been successfully assembled from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and spinous Fe2O3 nanowire modified hollow melamine foam decorated with polypyrrole as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Owing to the well&#8208;designed nanostructure and suitable matching of electrode materials, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibits an extended operation voltage window of 1.6&#8197;V with an energy density of 20.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 159.4&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the ASC shows stable cycling stability, with 81.3&#8201;% retention after 4000&#8197;cycles and a low internal resistance of 1.03&#8197;&#937;. Additionally, a 2.5&#8197;V light&#8208;emitting diode indicator can be lit up by three ASCs connected in series; this provides evidence of the practical application potential of the assembled energy&#8208;storage system. The excellent electrochemical performances should be credited to the significant enhancement of the specific surface area, charge transport, and mechanical stability resulting from the unique 3D morphology.

      <title>A Path to More Sustainable Catalysis: The Critical Role of LiBr in Avoiding Catalyst Death and its Impact on Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst death&#8230;.&#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is the poison, but LiBr is the cure! During the cross&#8208;coupling of alkylzincs to aryl electrophiles, Pd N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination followed by reductive elimination and aryl&#8208;reductive elimination to create the corresponding NHC&#8208;H or NHC&#8208;aryl salts, with the former being kinetically faster. The use of LiBr curtails this form of catalyst death and allows for dramatically higher turnover numbers (see scheme).







Abstract
The role that LiBr plays in the lifetime of Pd&#8208;NHC complexes has been investigated. A bromide ion is proposed to coordinate to Pd thereby preventing beta hydride elimination (BHE) (to form NHC&#8208;H+) of the reductive elimination (RE) intermediate that normally completes with the desired cross&#8208;coupling catalytic cycle. Coordinating groups, such as anilines, are able to bind suitably well to Pd to prevent this pathway from occurring, thus reducing the need for the added salt. The metal hydride formed from BHE is very unstable and RE of the hydride to the NHC ligand occurs very rapidly giving rise to the corresponding hydrido&#8208;NHC (i.e., NHC&#8208;H+). The use of the per deuterated dibutylzinc shows a significant deuterium isotope effect, shutting down catalyst death almost completely. The use of bis&#8208;neopentylzinc, now possessing no hydrides, eliminates catalyst death all together leading to a very long&#8208;lived catalytic cycle and confirming the untoward role of BHE.

      <title>Electronic Consequences of Ligand Substitution at Heterometal Centers in Polyoxovanadium Clusters: Controlling the Redox Properties via Heterometal Coordination Number</title>
      <dc:description>The rational control of the electrochemical properties of polyoxovandate&#8208;alkoxide clusters is dependent on understanding the influence of various synthetic modifications on the overall redox processes of these systems. In this work, we examine the electronic consequences of ligand substitution at the heteroion in a heterometal&#8208;functionalized cluster. The redox properties of [V  5  O  6  (OCH  3  )  12  FeCl] (  1&#8208;[V  5  FeCl]  ) and [V  5  O  6  (OCH  3  )  12  Fe]X (  2&#8208;[V  5  Fe]X  ; X = ClO  4  , OTf), were compared in order to assess the effects of changing the coordination environment around the iron center on the electrochemical properties of the cluster. Coordination of a chloride anion to iron leads to an anodic shift in redox events. Theoretical modelling of the electronic structure of these heterometal&#8208;functionalized clusters reveals, that differences in the redox profiles of  1&#8208;[V  5  FeCl]  and  2&#8208;[V  5  Fe]X  arise from changes in the number of ligands surrounding the iron center (e.g. 6&#8208;coordinate  vs  . 5&#8208;coordinate). Binding of the chloride to the sixth coordination site changes the orbital interaction between the iron and the delocalized electronic structure of the mixed&#8208;valent polyoxovanadate core. Tuning of the heterometal coordination environment can therefore be used to modulate the redox properties of the whole cluster.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Energy&#8208;Transfer Dynamics and Color Tunability of Na4CaSi3O9:Tb3+,Eu3+ for Warm White LEDs</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoluminescence properties of Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped Na4CaSi3O9 (NCSO) materials as well as the involved energy&#8208;transfer processes are systemically investigated, indicating the potential use of those phosphors in future lighting applications.







Abstract
In this work, a latent energy&#8208;transfer process in traditional Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped phosphors is proposed and a new class of Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped Na4CaSi3O9 (NCSO) phosphors is presented which is enabled by luminescence decay dynamics that optimize the electron&#8208;transfer energy process. Relative to other Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped phosphors, the as&#8208;synthesized Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped NCSO phosphors show improved large&#8208;scale tunable emission color from green to red upon UV excitation, controlled by the Tb3+/Eu3+ doping ratio. Detailed spectroscopic measurements in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)/UV/Vis region were used to determine the Eu3+&#8211;O2&#8722; charge&#8208;transfer energy, 4f&#8211;5d transition energies, and the energies of 4f excited multiplets of Eu3+ and Tb3+ with different 4fN electronic configurations. The Tb3+&#8594;Eu3+ energy&#8208;transfer pathway in the co&#8208;doped sample was systematically investigated, by employing luminescence decay dynamics analysis to elucidate the relevant energy&#8208;transfer mechanism in combination with the appropriate model simulation. To demonstrate their application potential, a prototype white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) device was successfully fabricated by using the yellow luminescence NCSO:0.03Tb3+, 0.05Eu3+ phosphor with high thermal stability and a BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor in combination with a near&#8208;UV chip. These findings open up a new avenue to realize and develop multifunctional high&#8208;performance phosphors by manipulating the energy&#8208;transfer process for practical applications.

      <title>Distance Matters: Effect of the Spacer Length on the Photophysical Properties of Multimodular Perylenediimide&#8211;Silicon Phthalocyanine&#8211;Fullerene Triads</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced events: Excited state energy transfer leading to 1SiPc*, and electron transfer leading to PDI.&#8722;&#8208;SiPc.+&#8208;C60 charge separated state, in a newly synthesized covalently linked triad featuring C60 and perylene diimide connected at the opposite ends of axial positions of a SiPc, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor conjugate featuring silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) as the electron donor, and two electron acceptors, namely tetrachloroperylenediimide (PDI) and C60, placed at the opposite ends of the SiPc axial positions, was newly designed and synthesized, and the results were compared to the earlier reported PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. Minimal intramolecular interactions between the entities was observed. Absorption, fluorescence, computational and electrochemical studies were performed to evaluate the excitation energy, geometry and electronic structure, and energy levels of different photoevents. Steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence and excitation spectral studies revealed efficient singlet&#8211;singlet energy transfer from 1PDI* to SiPc in the PDI&#8208;SiPc dyad and the PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. The measured rates for these photochemical events were found to be much higher than those reported earlier for the triad, due to closer proximity between the PDI and SiPc entities. The distance also affected the charge separation path in which involvement of PDI, and not C60, in charge separation in the present triad was witnessed. The present investigation brings out the importance of donor&#8211;acceptor distances in channeling photochemical events in a multimodular system.

      <title>Structural Changes of Hierarchically Nanoporous Organosilica/Silica Hybrid Materials by Pseudomorphic Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report how pseudomorphic transformation of divinylbenzene (DVB)&#8208;bridged organosilica@controlled pore glasses (CPG) offers the possibility to generate hierarchically porous organosilica/silica hybrid materials. CPG is utilized to provide granular shape/size and macroporosity and the macropores of the CPG is impregnated with organosilica phase, forming hybrid system. By subsequent pseudomorphic transformation, an ordered mesopore phase is generated while maintaining the granular shape and macroporosity of the CPG. Surface areas and mesopore sizes in the hierarchical structure are tunable by the choice of the surfactant and transformation time. 2&#8208;dimensional magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that micellar&#8208;templating affects both organosilica and silica phases and pseudomorphic transformation induces phase transition.

      <title>Filling a Gap: The Coordinatively Saturated Group 4 Carbonyl Complexes TM(CO)8 (TM = Zr, Hf) and Ti(CO)7</title>
      <dc:description>Homoleptic group 4 metal&#8722;carbonyl cation and neutral complexes are prepared in the gas phase and/or in solid neon matrix. Infrared spectroscopy studies reveal that both zirconium and hafnium form octa&#8208;coordinate carbonyl neutral and cation complexes. In contrast, titanium forms only the six&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  6  +  and seven&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  7  .

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Homoleptic group 4 metal&#8722;carbonyl cation and neutral complexes are prepared in the gas phase and/or in solid neon matrix. Infrared spectroscopy studies reveal that both zirconium and hafnium form octa&#8208;coordinate carbonyl neutral and cation complexes. In contrast, titanium forms only the six&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  6  +  and seven&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  7  . Titanium octacarbonyl Ti(CO)  8  is unstable due to steric repulsion between the CO ligands.

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes: Progress, Challenges and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
How to prepare heterocycles: Ruthenium(II)&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is discussed, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although RuII centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many RuII&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that RuII centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In this Minireview, an overview of the RuII&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is provided, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

      <title>Photoinitiated Thiol&#8208;ene Reactions of Enoses: A Powerful Tool for Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics with Challenging Glycosidic Linkages</title>
      <dc:description>
UV&#8208;light induced radical&#8208;mediated addition of thiols onto endo&#8208; or exo&#8208;cyclic double bonds of unsaturated sugars offers an easy and stereoselective route to a broad range of stable glycomimetics including 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosides and new types of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
Thioglycosides and C&#8208;glycosides represent pharmacologically useful classes of glycomimetics that possess a high degree of biological stability. One emerging tool for the stereoselective synthesis of thioglycosides is the photoinitiated addition of thiols to unsaturated sugars. Moreover, thiyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions of exo&#8208;glycals and 1&#8208;substituted endo&#8208;glycals offer facile routes to &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosidic structures. This Concept article summarizes the thiol&#8208;ene coupling strategies developed recently by our group and Soms&#225;k's group for the synthesis of several kinds of glycomimetics which are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods. One unusual characteristic of the thiol&#8208;ene reactions of endo&#8208;glycals is that heating inhibits, whereas cooling promotes the reaction. This unique temperature dependence as well as the effects of the enose structures and thiol configurations on the efficacy and stereoselectivity of the reactions are also discussed.

      <title>Solvophobically Driven Complexation of Adamantyl Mannoside with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin in Water and Structured Organic Solvents</title>
      <dc:description>
Favorable guest conditions: The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin are explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract
The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin were explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Efficient binding was observed only in hydrogen&#8208;bonded solvents, which indicated solvophobically driven complexation. The stability of the inclusion complex was considerably higher in aqueous media. A pronounced temperature dependence of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675;, resulting in perfect enthalpy&#8211;entropy compensation, was observed in water. The complexation thermodynamics was in line with classical rationale for the hydrophobic effect at lower temperatures and the nonclassical explanation at higher temperatures. This finding linked cyclodextrin complexation thermodynamics with insights regarding the effect of temperature on the hydration water structure. The complexation enthalpies and entropies were weakly dependent on temperature in organic media. The signs of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675; were in accordance with the nonclassical hydrophobic (solvophobic) effect. The structures of the optimized product corresponded to those deduced spectroscopically, and the calculated and experimentally obtained values of &#916;rG&#9675; were in very good agreement. This investigation clearly demonstrated that solvophobically driven formation of cyclodextrin complexes could be anticipated in structured solvents in general. However, unlike in water, adamantane and the host cavity behaved solely as structure breakers in the organic media explored so far.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Chalcogen Bonds: CSD and DFT Analyses and Biological Implication in Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive influences: Searches in the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Database in combination with theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory) show the importance of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonding interactions in crystal structures and in the inhibition mechanism of sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase.







Abstract
This study reports a combined Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical DFT study of charge assisted chalcogen bonds involving sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium cations. The chalcogen bond has been recently defined by IUPAC as the net attractive interaction between an electrophilic region associated with a chalcogen atom in a molecular entity and a nucleophilic region in another, or the same, molecular entity. Divalent chalcogen atoms typically have up to two &#963;&#8208;holes and forms up to two ChBs; the same holds for tetravalent chalcogens which adopt a seesaw arrangement. In sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium salts chalcogen atoms form three covalent bonds, three &#963;&#8208;holes are located opposite to these bonds, and up to three charge assisted ChBs can be formed between these holes and the counterions. The covalent bond arrangement around these chalcogen atoms is similar to trivalent pnictogen atoms and translates into a similar pattern of noncovalent interactions. We have found and studied this type of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonds in various sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase, for example, salacinol and kotalanol.

      <title>[2+2] Photodimerization of Stilbazoles Promoted by Oxalic Acid in Suspension</title>
      <dc:description>
A very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.







Abstract
In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A very simple technique&lt;/b&gt; to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural Tunability and Diversity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Lead Halide Benzenethiolate</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 (X=I, Br, or Cl), was synthesized and characterized with experimental and computational methods. These materials feature strong absorption, an extremely large Stokes Shift, and long carrier lifetimes. Interestingly, the bandgap can be tuned by choice of halide, with little to no effect on the photoluminescent emission.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials are currently of great interest for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Here, the synthesis and optical properties of a new type of halide&#8208;organothiolate&#8208;mixed 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3, are reported, in which X is a halide (I, Br, or Cl). Different from conventional lead&#8208;based 2D layered materials, these compounds feature unusual five&#8208;coordinated lead centers with a stereochemically active electron lone pair on the lead atoms and four&#8208;coordinated iodine atoms. The Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 materials feature an indirect bandgap, strongly emissive long&#8208;lived self&#8208;trap states, and an extremely large Stokes shift. Interestingly, the optical bandgap of the materials can be tuned through variation of the halides; however, the photoluminescence is less sensitive to the composition and is more likely dominated by lead&#8208;sulfur lattice interactions or the lead lone&#8208;pair electrons. Our results support that a halide&#8211;organothiolate mixed anion hybrid structure offers a unique platform for discovering new exciting 2D electronic materials.

Proton conductor: A Silver&#8211;bipyridine 1D coordination polymer crystallized with free H3PO4, H2PO4&#8722; and H2O molecules in its lattice form an infinitely extended 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that result in high proton conductivity of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity.

Abstract
Phosphate&#8208;based silver&#8211;bipyridine (Ag&#8208;bpy) 1D coordination polymer {[{Ag(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)}2{Ag(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)(H2PO4)}]&#8901;2&#8201;H2PO4&#8901;H3PO4&#8901;5&#8201;H2O}n (1) with free phosphoric acid (H3PO4), its conjugate base (H2PO4&#8722;) and water molecules in its lattice was synthesized by room&#8208;temperature crystallization and the hydrothermal method. An XRD study showed that coordinated H2PO4&#8722;, lattice H2PO4&#8722; anions, free H3PO4 and lattice water molecules are interconnected by H&#8208;bonding interactions, forming an infinitely extended 2D H&#8208;bonded network that facilitates proton transfer. This material exhibits a high proton conductivity of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, synthesis of this material from commercially available starting materials in water can be easily scaled up, and it is highly stable under extreme conditions of conductivity measurements. This report inaugurates the usage and design principle of proton&#8208;conducting frameworks based on crystallized phosphoric acid and phosphate.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>
Straightforward &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis: Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs because of their ubiquity in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams using tBuOOtBu. This method is based on Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky amidation and does not require prefunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds or the installation of a directing group, thereby allowing for the straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams. Our intramolecular functionalization protocol can be extended to diverse benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and shows excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance.

      <title>Atom&#8208;Ratio&#8208;Conducted Tailoring of PdAu Bimetallic Nanocrystals with Distinctive Shapes and Dimensions for Boosting the ORR Performance
</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction: 2D PdAu porous nanosheets (PNSs) demonstrate outstanding oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction performance compare to 1D anisotropic nanowires (NWs), 3D penetrative nanofibers (NFs) and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels.







Abstract
Systematically manipulating the shape, dimension, and surface structure of PdAu nanocrystals is an active subject because it offers a powerful means to regulate and investigate their structure&#8211;activity relationship. Meanwhile, it is still urgent to reduce the use of two&#8208;dimensional precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials. This work demonstrates that PdAu nanocrystals with a variety of shapes/dimensions, including 1D anisotropic nanowires, 2D porous nanosheets, and 3D penetrative nanoflowers, can be systematically synthesized by simply adjusting the atomic ratio or the reaction time in the same protocol. The resultant PdAu nanocrystals with distinctive shapes, but the same building blocks triumphantly avoid the effects of facet and surface properties; this represents an ideal platform for directly comparing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. 2D porous PdAu nanosheets demonstrate superior ORR performance (Eonset = 1.040&#8197;V, E1/2 = 0.932&#8197;V) compared with other&#8208;dimension&#8208;based samples and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels. This work not only paves the way for systematically measuring a series of distinctive PdAu nanocrystals as non&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts, but also sheds light on the study of structures/dimensions in tuning the catalytic properties of bimetallic nanocrystals.

      <title>Sulfinyl&#8208;Mediated Stereoselective Functionalization of Acyclic Conjugated Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rearrangements: A methodology to prepare acyclic unsaturated 1,4&#8208;diol derivatives from conjugated sulfinyl dienes has been developed. A cascade process that entails nucleophilic addition to produce a functionalized allylic sulfoxide, followed by [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and sulfenate cleavage renders the target molecules with high yields and selectivities (see scheme).







Abstract
The chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled functionalization of conjugated sulfinyl dienes in a cascade process that involves a conjugate addition, diastereoselective protonation and a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is reported. Enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;diol and 1,4&#8208;aminoalcohol derivatives are obtained in a very straightforward manner. Further functionalization of these structures, including highly stereoselective epoxidation, dihydroxylation and the stereodivergent synthesis of several polyols in a controlled fashion is described.

      <title>How to Bend a Cumulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend it: [n]Cumulenes are known for the linearity of their carbon chains, but when the terminal groups are N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, this situation changes. The even cumulenes of this family can be bent depending on the &#960; acidity of the carbene terminal group. Poor &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the carbon chain to the terminal group promotes a significant bending in the carbon chain.







Abstract
Allenes (carbodicarbenes) and [3]cumulenes are linear carbon chains that can be bent when the terminal group has a strong carbene nature. This bending can be quite pronounced in allenes but not in [3]cumulenes. In this study, how N&#8208;heterocyclic or cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (NHC and CAAC, respectively) terminal groups can modify the linear structure of [n]cumulenes has been analyzed. A low &#960; acidity of the terminal carbene affects the linearity of [2n]cumulenes. Indeed, it has been found that the NHC [4]cumulene is extremely bent, contrary to classical [4]cumulenes. The predicted NHC [4]cumulene or tricarbodicarbene has two lone pairs and the &#960; electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule. More significantly, DFT calculations have shown that this bent [4]cumulene is very stable, considerably more so than the corresponding [3]cumulene, which has been elusive to synthesize. Remarkably, calculations have shown that all the NHC [2n]cumulenes are more than 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the [2n&#8722;1]cumulenes.

      <title>Bifunctional Catalysts for Reversible Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional oxygen catalysts require multiactive centers to catalyze both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Metal/heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon composites with abundant active centers have been proven to have outstanding performance when replacing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based bifunctional oxygen catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) and reversible fuel cells (RFCs) rely on the bifunctional oxygen catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finding efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts is the ultimate goal and it has attracted a great deal of attention. The dilemma is that a good ORR catalyst is not necessarily efficient for OER, and vice versa. Thus, the development of a new type of bifunctional oxygen catalysts should ensure that the catalysts exhibit high activity for both OER and ORR. Composites with multicomponents for active centers supported on highly conductive matrices could be able to meet the challenges and offering new opportunities. In this Review, the evolution of bifunctional catalysts is summarized and discussed aiming to deliver high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials.

      <title>A Facile Grinding Method for the Synthesis of 3D Ag Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Containing Ag6Mo7O24 for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
The daily grind: Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) compounds are successfully synthesized by a simple grinding method. The resulting {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) has the high specific capacitance of 971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (higher than other compounds), excellent rate ability, and long cycle stability. In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Successful synthesis of three kinds of dynamically stable compounds by a simple grinding method is reported, giving Ag6Mo7O24, Ag&#8208;BTC (Ag&#8208;MOF, BTC=benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid), and {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). According to the electrochemical dynamic analysis, these materials have pseudocapacitor behavior and high capacitance. The unique nanorod structure of {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF provides more active sites, faster ion/electron transfer, and electrolyte diffusion pathways, resulting in excellent specific capacitance (971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) higher than the other compounds. {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) also has an excellent rate ability (60.1&#8201;%) and long cycle stability (98&#8201;% retention after 5000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery (with nickel foam as the current collector) fabricated with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V. These results demonstrate a new simple grinding method to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) for high&#8208;performance materials.

      <title>Are Hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes Aromatic or Not? A DFT Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>
Calculating substitutes: Aromaticity dependence is found in hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes. Specifically, metallazapentalene exhibits comparable aromaticity to that of metallapentalene, whereas lower aromaticity and nonaromaticity are suggested in metallaborapentalene and metalloxapentalene, respectively.







Abstract
Aromaticity is one of the most basic concepts in organic chemistry. The planar M&#246;bius aromatic metallapentalynes and metallapentalenes have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. However, the aromaticity of metallapentalenes containing heteroatoms (such as B, N, and O), termed as hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes, is rarely studied. Herein, the stability and aromaticity of a series of hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes are theoretically investigated. The results reveal lower aromaticity in metallaborapentalene, comparable aromaticity in metallazapentalene, and nonaromaticity in metalloxapentalene relative to that of metallapentalene. Moreover, the effect of Lewis bases on the aromaticity and stability of metallaborapentalene is discussed. These results provide useful information for experimental chemists to realize more hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes.

      <title>Functionalised N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Bimetallic Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic carbene complexes: This minireview covers the use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands in the formation of bimetallic architectures. NHCs are shown to bind one metal through the conventional C2 position and coordinate to another through donor atoms tethered to the NHC, through the N atom itself or through the NHC backbone. These bimetallic species are potentially useful models for decomposition reactions in homogeneous catalysis and organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become immensely successful ligands in coordination chemistry and homogeneous catalysis due to their strong terminal &#963;&#8208;donor properties.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bimetallic carbene complexes&lt;/b&gt;: This minireview covers the use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands in the formation of bimetallic architectures. NHCs are shown to bind one metal through the conventional C2 position and coordinate to another through donor atoms tethered to the NHC, through the N atom itself or through the NHC backbone. These bimetallic species are potentially useful models for decomposition reactions in homogeneous catalysis and organometallic chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become immensely successful ligands in coordination chemistry and homogeneous catalysis due to their strong terminal &#963;&#8208;donor properties. However, by targeting NHC ligands with additional functionalisation, a new area of NHC coordination chemistry has developed that has enabled NHCs to be used to build up bimetallic and multimetallic architectures.

      <title>Strategies for the Controlled Covalent Double Functionalization of Graphene Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Twice is better than once: A double and mild functionalization strategy of graphene oxide is reported based on the combination of a nucleophilic epoxide opening and hydroxyl derivatization by esterification or Williamson reaction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile platform with unique properties that have found broad applications in the biomedical field. Double functionalization is a key aspect in the design of multifunctional GO with combined imaging, targeting, and therapeutic properties. Compared to noncovalent functionalization, covalent strategies lead to GO conjugates with a higher stability in biological fluids. However, only a few double covalent functionalization approaches have been developed so far. The complexity of GO makes the derivatization of the oxygenated groups difficult to control. The combination of a nucleophilic epoxide ring opening with the derivatization of the hydroxyl groups through esterification or Williamson reaction was investigated. The conditions were selective and mild, thus preserving the structure of GO. Our strategy of double functionalization holds great potential for different applications in which the derivatization of GO with different molecules is needed, especially in the biomedical field.

      <title>A Reusable CNT&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of C&#8722;N Bonds
</title>
      <dc:description>
A superior commoner! A reusable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs, prepared from iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been used for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. The catalytic performance superior to those of noble&#8208;metal catalysts such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. This outstanding performance originates from the introduction of Fe&#8208;Nx into the CNTs and the resulting electronic coupling between the iron species and the CNTs.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation is regarded as a very useful and fundamental reaction for the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Noble&#8208;metal and homogeneous catalysts have frequently been used for C&#8722;N bond formation, however, these catalysts have a number of disadvantages, such as high cost, toxicity, and low atom economy. In this work, a low&#8208;toxic and cheap iron complex (iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) has been loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to prepare a heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) named Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs. We employed this SAC in the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds for the first time. It was found that Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs is an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds starting from aromatic amines and ketones. Its catalytic performance was excellent, giving yields of up to 96&#8201;%, six&#8208;fold higher than the yields obtained with noble&#8208;metal catalysts, such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. The catalyst showed efficacy in the reactions of thirteen aromatic amine substrates, without the need for additives, and seventeen enaminones were obtained. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iron species were well dispersed in the Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst as single atoms and that Fe&#8208;Nx might be the catalytic active species. This Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst has potential industrial applications as it could be cycled seven times without any significant loss of activity.

      <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Regiodivergent Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Mupirocin Methyl Ester</title>
      <dc:description>
endo vs. exo: Chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are used for achieving regiocontrol over the endo vs. exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin methyl ester. This approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. The mechanism of these reactions is investigated by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions.







Abstract
This article presents a new strategy for achieving regiocontrol over the endo versus exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing alcohols, which leads to the formation of five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered cyclic ethers. Unlike traditional methods relying on achiral reagents or enzymes, this approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. By using methyl ester of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin as the substrate, it is demonstrated that catalytic chiral phosphoric acids (R)&#8208;TCYP and (S)&#8208;TIPSY could be used to achieve the selective formation of either the six&#8208;membered endo product (95:5 r.r.) or the five&#8208;membered exo product (77:23 r.r.), correspondingly. This cyclization was found to be unselective under the standard conditions involving various achiral acids, bases, or buffers. The subsequent mechanistic studies using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions provided the description of the potential energy surface, which is fully consistent with the experimental observations. Based on these results, highly detailed reaction paths are obtained and a concerted and highly synchronous mechanism is proposed for the formation of both exo and endo products.

      <title>Engineering of Laccase CueO for Improved Electron Transfer in Bioelectrocatalysis by Semi&#8208;Rational Design</title>
      <dc:description>
As a promising cathodic biocatalyst in enzymatic biofuel cells, laccase CueO catalyzes oxygen reduction efficiently thanks to the supplemental Cu binding. Substituting at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu binding site was shown to enable the manipulation of electrocatalytic current, which is more remarkable than substitution at the conventional Cu active sites.







Abstract
Copper efflux oxidase (CueO) from Escherichia coli is a special bacterial laccase due to its fifth copper binding site. Herein, it is discovered that the fifth Cu occupancy plays a crucial and favorable role of electron relay in bioelectrocatalytic oxygen reduction. By substituting the residues at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu, 11 beneficial variants are identified with &#8805;2.5&#8208;fold increased currents at &#8722;250&#8197;mV (up to 6.13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Detailed electrocatalytic characterization suggests the microenvironment of the fifth Cu binding site governs the electrocatalytic current of CueO. Additionally, further electron transfer analysis assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation demonstrates that an increase in localized structural stability and a decrease of distance between the fifth Cu and the T1 Cu are two main factors contributing to the improved kinetics of CueO variants. It may guide a novel way to tailor laccases and perhaps other oxidoreductases for bioelectrocatalytic applications.

      <title>Effect of Axial Ligands on Easy&#8208;Axis Anisotropy and Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Heptacoordinated FeII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic anisotropy in FeII complexes: Three new heptacoordinated FeII complexes of the general formulae [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The magnitude of the easy&#8208;axis anisotropy of complex 3 is larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to weak d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; interactions between the &#960; orbitals of the metal and the axial donor ligands.







Abstract
A rational approach to modulating easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy by varying the axial donor ligand in heptacoordinated FeII complexes has been explored. In this series of complexes with formulae of [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) [H4L=2,2&#8242;&#8208;{pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylbis(ethan&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)}bis(N&#8208;phenylhydrazinecarboxamide)], the axial positions are successively occupied by different nitrogen&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;donor ligands. Detailed dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal the existence of easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy for all of the complexes, with 1 [Ueff=21&#8197;K, &#964;0=1.72&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] and 2 [Ueff=25&#8197;K, &#964;0=2.25&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] showing field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior. However, both experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate the magnitude of the D value of complex 3 to be larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to the axial bond angle being smaller than that for an ideal geometry. Detailed analysis of the field and temperature dependences of relaxation time for 1 and 2 has revealed that multiple relaxation processes (quantum tunneling of magnetization, direct, and Raman) are involved in slow magnetic relaxation for both of these complexes. Magnetic dilution experiments support the role of intermolecular short contacts.

      <title>Combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy Using Polyfunctionalised Nanoparticles Bearing Robust Gadolinium Surface Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhancing contrast: The straightforward synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles combines the robust attachment of gadolinium units for enhanced MRI contrast with photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
A robust dithiocarbamate tether allows novel gadolinium units based on DOTAGA (q=1) to be attached to the surface of gold nanoparticles (2.6&#8211;4.1&#8197;nm diameter) along with functional units offering biocompatibility, targeting and photodynamic therapy. A dramatic increase in relaxivity (r1) per Gd unit from 5.01&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in unbound form to 31.68&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (10&#8197;MHz, 37&#8201;&#176;C) is observed when immobilised on the surface due to restricted rotation and enhanced rigidity of the Gd complex on the nanoparticle surface. The single&#8208;step synthetic route provides a straightforward and versatile way of preparing multifunctional gold nanoparticles, including examples with conjugated zinc&#8211;tetraphenylporphyrin photosensitizers. The lack of toxicity of these materials (MTT assays) is transformed on irradiation of HeLa cells for 30&#8197;minutes (PDT), leading to 75&#8201;% cell death. In addition to passive targeting, the inclusion of units capable of actively targeting overexpressed folate receptors illustrates the potential of these assemblies as targeted theranostic agents.

      <title>Reassessment of an Innovative Insulin Analogue Excludes Protracted Action yet Highlights the Distinction between External and Internal Diselenide Bridges</title>
      <dc:description>
A seleno&#8208;analogue of bovine insulin, Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB], in which the external interchain disulfide bond A7&#8722;B7 was replaced by diselenide, preserves biological activity but does not augment stability, protect from proteolysis or confer protracted action.







Abstract
Long&#8208;acting insulin analogues represent the most prescribed class of therapeutic proteins. An innovative design strategy was recently proposed: diselenide substitution of an external disulfide bridge. This approach exploited the distinctive physicochemical properties of selenocysteine (U). Relative to wild type (WT), Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB] was reported to be protected from proteolysis by insulin&#8208;degrading enzyme (IDE), predicting prolonged activity. Because of this strategy's novelty and potential clinical importance, we sought to validate these findings and test their therapeutic utility in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. Surprisingly, the analogue did not exhibit enhanced stability, and its susceptibility to cleavage by either IDE or a canonical serine protease (glutamyl endopeptidase Glu&#8208;C) was similar to WT. Moreover, the analogue's pharmacodynamic profile in rats was not prolonged relative to a rapid&#8208;acting clinical analogue (insulin lispro). Although [C7UA, C7UB] does not confer protracted action, nonetheless its comparison to internal diselenide bridges promises to provide broad biophysical insight.

      <title>Exploring Opportunities for Platinum Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Porous Liquids as Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous liquids for catalysts: Platinum nanoparticles encapsulated within a Type&#8197;I porous liquid are successfully employed for the first time as hydrogenation catalysts. In addition, this work explores the effect of each component of the corona&#8208;canopy on the catalytic activity.







Abstract
The unusual combination of characteristics observed for porous liquids, which are typically associated with either porous solids or liquids, has led to considerable interest in this new class of materials. However, these porous liquids have so far only been investigated for their ability to separate and store gases. Herein, the catalytic capability of Pt nanoparticles encapsulated within a Type&#8197;I porous liquid (Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2 PL) is explored for the hydrogenation of several alkenes and nitroarenes under mild conditions (T=40&#8201;&#176;C, PH2=1&#8197;atm). The different intermediates in the porous liquid synthesis (i.e., the initial Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2, the organosilane&#8208;functionalized intermediate, and the final porous liquid) are employed as catalysts in order to understand the effect of each component of the porous liquid on the catalysis. For the hydrogenation of 1&#8208;decene, the Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2 PL catalyst in ethanol has the fastest reaction rate if normalized with respect to the concentration of Pt. The reaction rate slows if the reaction is completed in a &#8220;neat&#8221; porous liquid system, probably because of the high viscosity of the system. These systems may find application in cascade reactions, in particular, for those with mutually incompatible catalysts.

      <title>Untapped Opportunities of Resin&#8208;to&#8208;Resin Transfer Reactions (RRTR) for the Convergent Assembly of Multivalent Peptide Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>
Resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions provide a strategic shortcut to convergent peptide assembly, and offer practical advantages with respect to the associated handling issues. Nonetheless, these assets have remained untapped so far and, in this work, this methodology was successfully adopted for the construction of a peptidosteroid adduct. Readily obtained by a fully solid&#8208;phase&#8208;based procedure, our model confirms the synthetic utility and renews the relevance of RRTR to bioconjugate designs.







Abstract
Handling of the individual fragments remains a bottleneck in the convergent assembly of peptides. Overlooked since the emergence of ligation chemistries during the past two decades, so&#8208;called resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions (RRTR) are here reported as a strategic shortcut in this context. Condensation of the involved moieties at an acceptor resin is facilitated by shuttling peptide segments directly from a donor resin in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The straightforward synthesis of a sterically constrained 13&#8208;mer peptidosteroid model illustrates the utility of this approach. The first successful application of the RRTR methodology in the field of multivalent design and bioconjugation is here reported. Relying on established procedures to generate, monitor and isolate intermediates and products, the solid&#8208;phase nature of our entire strategy allows for the fast construction of polypeptide adducts and libraries thereof. As such, a rejuvenated use and new opportunities for RRTR is reported.

Nonetheless, these assets have remained untapped so far and, in this work, this methodology was successfully adopted for the construction of a peptidosteroid adduct. Readily obtained by a fully solid&#8208;phase&#8208;based procedure, our model confirms the synthetic utility and renews the relevance of RRTR to bioconjugate designs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling of the individual fragments remains a bottleneck in the convergent assembly of peptides. Overlooked since the emergence of ligation chemistries during the past two decades, so&#8208;called resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions (RRTR) are here reported as a strategic shortcut in this context. Condensation of the involved moieties at an acceptor resin is facilitated by shuttling peptide segments directly from a donor resin in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The straightforward synthesis of a sterically constrained 13&#8208;mer peptidosteroid model illustrates the utility of this approach. The first successful application of the RRTR methodology in the field of multivalent design and bioconjugation is here reported. Relying on established procedures to generate, monitor and isolate intermediates and products, the solid&#8208;phase nature of our entire strategy allows for the fast construction of polypeptide adducts and libraries thereof. As such, a rejuvenated use and new opportunities for RRTR is reported.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphorene&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Promising electrocatalysts: Phosphorene, ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) with monolayered or few&#8208;layered structure, has emerged as a promising member of the family of 2D materials. As a single&#8208;elemental material, phosphorene has shown its potential as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and other electrocatalytic applications. Its great potential in this emerging field needs to be further explored.







Abstract
Phosphorene, generally defined as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) with monolayered or few&#8208;layered structure, has emerged as a promising member of the family of 2D materials. Since its discovery in 2014, extensive research has been focused on broadening its applications, covering the biological, photoelectric, and electrochemical fields, owing to the unique physicochemical and structural properties. As a single&#8208;elemental material, phosphorene has demonstrated its applicability for the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and other electrocatalytic applications. In this Minireview, a summary of the very recent research progresses of phosphorene in electrocatalysis is offered, with a special focus on the effective synthetic strategies towards performance improvement. In the concluding section, challenges and perspectives are also discussed.
