      <title>Electrochemical C&#8208;H Functionalization of (Hetero)Arenes &#8211; Optimized by DoE</title>
      <dc:description>A novel approach towards the activation of different arenes and purines including caffeine and theophylline is presented. The simple, safe and scalable electrochemical synthesis of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8209;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) aryl ethers was conducted using an easy electrolysis setup with boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. Good yields up to 59% were achieved. Triethylamine was used as a base as it forms a highly conductive media with HFIP, making additional supporting electrolytes superfluous. The synthesis was optimized using Design of Experiment techniques giving a detailed insight to the significance of the reaction parameters. The mechanism was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Subsequent transition metal&#8208;catalyzed as well as metal&#8208;free functionalization led to interesting motifs in excellent yields up to 94%.</dc:description>

Abstract
A maximization of a direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and electrodes can be obtained through the oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. Here, a strategy for obtaining carbon nanotube (CNTs) based electrodes covalently modified with perfectly control&#8208;oriented fungal laccases is presented. Modelizations of the laccase&#8208;CNT interaction and of electron conduction pathways serve as a guide in choosing grafting positions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maximization of a direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and electrodes can be obtained through the oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. Here, a strategy for obtaining carbon nanotube (CNTs) based electrodes covalently modified with perfectly control&#8208;oriented fungal laccases is presented. Modelizations of the laccase&#8208;CNT interaction and of electron conduction pathways serve as a guide in choosing grafting positions. Homogeneous populations of alkyne&#8208;modified laccases are obtained through the reductive amination of a unique surface&#8208;accessible lysine residue selectively engineered near either one or the other of the two copper centers in enzyme variants. Immobilization of the site&#8208;specific alkynated enzymes is achieved by copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction on azido&#8208;modified CNTs. A highly efficient reduction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low overpotential and catalytic current densities over &#8722;3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained by minimizing the distance from the electrode surface to the trinuclear cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stereoselective Formation of Facial Tris&#8208;cyclometalated Pt(IV) Complexes.&#160;Dual Phosphorescence from Heteroleptic Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>A stereoselective synthetic route to homo&#8208; and heteroleptic facial tris&#8208;cyclometalated Pt(IV) complexes is reported, involving the oxidative addition of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208; or 2&#8208;(1&#8208;isoquinolinyl)benzenediazonium salts to  cis  &#8208;[Pt(C^N)  2  ] precursors, with C^N = cyclometalated 2&#8208;(  p  &#8208;tolyl)pyridine (tpy), 2&#8208;phenylquinoline (pq), 2&#8208;(2&#8208;thienyl)pyridine or 1&#8208;phenylsioquinoline (piq), to produce labile diazenide intermediates that undergo photochemical or thermal elimination of N  2  .

      <title>Multimeric Presentation of RGD Peptidomimetics Enhances Integrin Binding and Tumor Cell Uptake</title>

Consequently, the tricationic molecules are reduced&#160; via&#160; a partial electron transfer process from graphene, a process which is accompanied by the loss of counterions.

      <title>Assessing Crystallisation Kinetics of Zr Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Turbidity Measurements to Inform Rapid Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the crystallisation of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), network solids of metal ions or clusters connected by organic ligands, is often hindered by the significant number of synthetic variables inherent to their synthesis. Coordination modulation, the addition of monotopic competing ligands to solvothermal syntheses, can allow tuning of physical properties (particle size, porosity, surface chemistry), enhance crystallinity, and select desired phases, by modifying the kinetics of self&#8208;assembly, but its mechanism(s) are poorly understood. Herein, we use turbidity measurements to assess the effects of modulation on the solvothermal synthesis of the prototypical Zr terephthalate MOF UiO&#8208;66 and apply the knowledge gained to its rapid microwave synthesis. The studied experimental parameters &#8208; temperature, reagent concentration, reagent aging, metal precursor, water content, and modulator addition &#8208; all influence the time taken for onset of nucleation, and subsequently allow microwave synthesis of UiO&#8208;66 in as little as one minute. The simple, low cost turbidity measurements align closely with previously reported  in situ  synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, proving their simplicity and utility for probing the nucleation of complex materials while offering significant insights to the synthetic chemist.</dc:description>

      <title>Developing Wide Bandgap Polymers with Single Benzodithiophene&#8208;Based Unit for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a series of single benzodithiophene&#8208;based wide bandgap polymer donors, namely PBDTT, PBDTS, PBDTF and PBDTCl, were developed for efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) by just varying the heteroatoms into the conjugated side chains. The effects of sulfuration, fluorination and chlorination were also investigated systematically on the overall properties of these BDT&#8208;based polymers. The HOMO levels could be lowered gradually by introducing sulfur, fluorine and chlorine atoms into the side chains, which contributed to the stepwise increased Voc (from 0.78 V to 0.84 V) in the related PSCs using Y6 as the electron acceptor. On the other hand, above side chain engineering strategy could promote the polymer chain interactions and fine&#8208;tune the phase separation of active blends, leading to the enhanced absorption, ordered molecular packing and crystallinity. Among them, the chlorinated PBDTCl exhibited not only high level absorption and crystallinity, but also the most balanced hole/electron charge transport and the most optimized morphology, giving rise to the best PCE of 13.46% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 23.16 mA cm&#8208;2 and an FF of 69.2 %.

      <title>WS2/MoS2 Heterostructures through Thermal Treatment of MoS2 Layers Electrostatically Functionalized with W3S4 Molecular Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Stacked layers: The reported simple and scalable chemical strategy for the preparation of WS2/MoS2 stacked layers gives rise to clean heterostructures with strong interlayer interaction. MoS2 flakes with a negatively charged surface are functionalized with a cationic W cluster, which undergoes a dry thermal decomposition into thin WS2 layers. The quenching of the photoluminescence signal in the prepared heterostructure proves an efficient interlayer coupling.







Abstract
The preparation of 2D stacked layers combining flakes of different nature gives rise to countless numbers of heterostructures where new band alignments, defined at the interfaces, control the electronic properties of the system. Among the large family of 2D/2D heterostructures, the one formed by the combination of the most common semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, WS2/MoS2, has awakened great interest owing to its photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties. Solution as well as dry physical methods have been developed to optimize the synthesis of these heterostructures. Here, a suspension of negatively charged MoS2 flakes is mixed with a methanolic solution of a cationic W3S4&#8208;core cluster, giving rise to a homogeneous distribution of the clusters over the layers. In a second step, a calcination of this molecular/2D heterostructure under N2 leads to the formation of clean WS2/MoS2 heterostructures, where the photoluminescence of both counterparts is quenched, proving an efficient interlayer coupling. Thus, this chemical method combines the advantages of a solution approach (simple, scalable, and low&#8208;cost) with the good quality interfaces reached by using more complicated traditional physical methods.

      <title>Enhanced and Heteromolecular Guest Encapsulation in Nonporous Crystals of a Perfluorinated Triketonato Dinuclear Copper Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Guest encapsulation: A perfluorinated dinuclear complex, comprised of a Cu2O6 core and four pentafluorophenyl groups, was prepared and the crystal encapsulates various benzene derivatives. The number of guest molecules found in the crystal was higher than that in the corresponding mononuclear complex and a new type of heteromolecular guest encapsulation was achieved.







Abstract
The flexible host framework of a perfluorinated mononuclear copper complex, [Cu(L1)2] (1, HL1=3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;propen&#8208;1&#8208;one), with a CuO4 core reversibly encapsulated several organic guest molecules through electrostatic interactions in its crystals. Hence, the corresponding dinuclear complex, [Cu2(L2)2] (2, H2L2=1,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,5&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;pentadien&#8208;3&#8208;one), was prepared to enhance guest recognition and the ability to separate molecular mixtures. Complex 2 comprises a Cu2O6 core and four pentafluorophenyl groups. In crystal 2, cavities are formed on the axial sites of the metal core that are surrounded by pentafluorophenyl groups. The crystal of 2 encapsulates various guest molecules, that is, benzene (3), toluene (4), xylene (5), mesitylene (6), durene (7), and anisole (8). X&#8208;ray crystallographic and thermogravimetric (TG) studies show that three guest molecules are present in the crystal cavities. The number of guest molecules found in complex 2 was higher than that in complex 1, for example, (2)3&#8901;(6)10&gt;1&#8901;(6)2, (2)2&#8901;(7)7&gt;1&#8901;7, or 2&#8901;(8)3&gt;1&#8901;(8)2. Naphthalene (9), was encapsulated in 2 to give 2&#8901;(9)3, but not in 1. In the crystal of complex 2, heteromolecular guest encapsulation was confirmed, designated as 2&#8901;(3)2&#8901;9. TG analysis indicates that the thermal stability of the guest&#8208;included crystals of 2 is higher than that of 1.

      <dc:description>
Electrosynthesis takes the lead: Electrosynthesis enables green and atom&#8208;economic access to 2H&#8208;2&#8208;(aryl)&#8208;benzo[d]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles or their N&#8208;oxides from 2&#8208;nitroazobenzenes. This operationally very simple protocol is conducted in an undivided cell by constant current electrolysis. Optionally, inexpensive NaOH can be used as both a supporting electrolyte and additive.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of 2H&#8208;2&#8208;(aryl)benzo[d]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and their N&#8208;oxides from 2&#8208;nitroazobenzene derivatives is reported. The electrolysis is conducted in a very simple undivided cell under constant current conditions with a leaded bronze cathode and a glassy carbon anode. The product distribution between 2H&#8208;2&#8208;(aryl)benzo[d]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and their N&#8208;oxides can be guided by simply controlling the current density and the amount of the charge applied. The reaction tolerates several sensitive functional groups in reductive electrochemistry. The usefulness and the applicability of the synthetic method is demonstrated by a formal synthesis of an antiviral compound.

The electrolysis is conducted in a very simple undivided cell under constant current conditions with a leaded bronze cathode and a glassy carbon anode. The product distribution between &lt;i&gt;2H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;2&#8208;(aryl)benzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and their N&#8208;oxides can be guided by simply controlling the current density and the amount of the charge applied. The reaction tolerates several sensitive functional groups in reductive electrochemistry. The usefulness and the applicability of the synthetic method is demonstrated by a formal synthesis of an antiviral compound.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Janus Fluorographene Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Janus graphene nanosheets with hydroxyl groups on one side and fluorine atoms on the other were obtained by a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction. When graphene is dispersed in water, the nanosheets simultaneously adopt an arrangement driven by the hydroxyl groups, whereas when dispersed in nonpolar solvents, such as chloroform, the arrangement of layers is governed by the hydrophobic nature of C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Fluorographene, a two&#8208;dimensional derivative of graphene, is an excellent starting material for the synthesis of graphene derivatives. In this work, a one&#8208;step, substrate&#8208;free method for the asymmetric functionalization of fluorographene layers with hydroxyl groups by a facile nucleophilic substitution reaction is reported. Such a chemical modification occurs in a biphasic aqueous&#8211;organic system under mild conditions, leading to Janus graphene nanosheets functionalized by hydroxyl groups on one side and retaining fluorine atoms on the other. The reported experimental route paves the way for two&#8208;dimensional bifacial graphene templates, thus broadening the application potential of graphene materials.

      <title>Insight into the Formation and Transfer Process of the First Intermediate of CO2 Reduction over Ag&#8208;Decorated Dendritic Cu</title>
      <dc:description>
Understanding CO2 electroreduction: Ag is used to decorate dendritic Cu and a high Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 (25&#8201;%) is obtained on a CuAg electrode, which is about five times higher than dendritic Cu. The intermediates are investigated by in situ Raman spectroscopy to understand how the first intermediates of CO2 reduction are formed and converted to multi&#8208;carbon products over Cu&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
It is still poorly understood how the first intermediates of CO2 reduction are formed and converted to multi&#8208;carbon products over Cu&#8208;based electrodes. Herein, Ag is used to decorate dendritic Cu and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H4 (25&#8201;%) is obtained on a CuAg electrode, which is about five times higher than dendritic Cu. The intermediates including *CO2&#8722;, OH groups, Cu&#8208;CO, C&#8208;O rotation, and CHx species are investigated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. This work provides spectroscopic evidence that the first intermediate of CO2 reduction on Ag&#8208;decorated Cu is carboxylate anion *CO2&#8722; bonded with the catalyst surface through the C and O atom. The formation and evolution process of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate over the applied potential are investigated in depth as well. This research contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of CO2 reduction and multi&#8208;carbon product formation pathways over Ag&#8208;decorated Cu.

      <title>Hollow PtFe Alloy Nanoparticles Derived from Pt&#8208;Fe3O4 Dimers through a Silica&#8208;Protection Reduction Strategy as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple synthetic route towards supported hollow PtFe alloy catalysts is described. A SiO2 protection reduction strategy enabled Pt and Fe alloying at 900&#8201;&#176;C whilst preventing metal nanoparticle aggregation. Acid etching removed the SiO2 shell and some of the Fe in the nanoparticles. The ORR activity and stability of the resulting hollow PtFe alloy catalysts were outstanding (see figure).







Abstract
The development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for the large&#8208;scale production of fuel cells. Platinum (Pt) nanoparticle catalysts show excellent performance for ORR, though the high cost of Pt is a limiting factor that directly impacts fuel cell production costs. Alloying Pt with other transition metals is an effective strategy to reduce Pt utilization whilst maintaining good ORR performance. In this work, novel hollow PtFe alloy catalysts were successfully synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of SiO2&#8208;coated Pt&#8208;Fe3O4 nanoparticle dimers supported on carbon at 900&#8201;&#176;C, followed by SiO2 shell removal and partial dealloying of the PtFe nanoparticles formed using HF. The obtained hollow PtFe nanoparticle catalysts (denoted herein as PtFe&#8208;900) showed a 2.3&#8208;fold enhancement in ORR mass activity compared to PtFe nanoparticles synthesized without SiO2 protection, and a remarkable 7.8&#8208;fold enhancement relative to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Further, after 10&#8201;000&#8197;potential cycles, the ORR mass activity of PtFe&#8208;900 remained very high (90.9&#8201;% of the initial mass activity). The outstanding ORR performance of PtFe&#8208;900 can be attributed to the modification of Pt lattice and electronic structure by alloying with Fe at high temperature under the protection of the SiO2 coating. This work guides the development of improved, highly dispersed Pt&#8208;based alloy nanoparticle catalysts for ORR and fuel cell applications.

      <title>Bottom&#8208;up Design of Bimetallic Cobalt&#8211;Molybdenum Carbides/Oxides for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
A rational bottom&#8208;up design method gives access to bimetallic metal carbide/oxide nanoparticles deposited on N,P&#8208;doped carbon matrices. The resulting composites show outstanding electrochemical reactivity for oxygen and hydrogen evolution and allow the assembly of an overall water&#8208;splitting device (see figure).







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting are critical for sustainable energy schemes. In this work, we use a rational design method for the synthesis of ultrasmall and highly dispersed bimetallic CoMo carbide/oxide particles deposited on graphene oxide. Thermal conversion of the molecular precursors [H3PMo12O40], Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O and melamine in the presence of graphene oxide gives the mixed carbide/oxide (Co6Mo6C2/Co2Mo3O8) nanoparticle composite deposited on highly dispersed, N,P&#8208;doped carbon. The resulting composite shows outstanding electrocatalytic water&#8208;splitting activity for both the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction, and superior performance to reference samples including commercial 20&#8201;% Pt/C &amp; IrO2. Electrochemical and other materials analyses indicate that Co6Mo6C2 is the main active phase in the composite, and the N,P&#8208;doping of the carbon matrix increases the catalytic activity. The facile design could in principle be extended to multiple bimetallic catalyst classes by tuning of the molecular metal oxide precursor.

&lt;p&gt;Earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting are critical for sustainable energy schemes. In this work, we use a rational design method for the synthesis of ultrasmall and highly dispersed bimetallic CoMo carbide/oxide particles deposited on graphene oxide. Thermal conversion of the molecular precursors [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PMo&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;], Co(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;4&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and melamine in the presence of graphene oxide gives the mixed carbide/oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticle composite deposited on highly dispersed, N,P&#8208;doped carbon. The resulting composite shows outstanding electrocatalytic water&#8208;splitting activity for both the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction, and superior performance to reference samples including commercial 20&#8201;% Pt/C &amp; IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Electrochemical and other materials analyses indicate that Co&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the main active phase in the composite, and the N,P&#8208;doping of the carbon matrix increases the catalytic activity. The facile design could in principle be extended to multiple bimetallic catalyst classes by tuning of the molecular metal oxide precursor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Situ Transformation of Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Carbide Nanocubes by Water Oxidation: Applications for Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoelectrocatalysis: A bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe PBA&#8208;derived O,N&#8208;codoped Ni&#8211;Fe carbide, can be well tuned to optimize the structure and OER performance. It is in situ transformed to the real active species of NiFeOxHy on the surface during OER measurement (see figure). Furthermore, this is then successfully applied to highly efficient Zn&#8211;air batteries and photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation.







Abstract
Using bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a precursor is effective for preparing electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); however, the role of these PBA&#8208;derived catalysts in the OER is still ambiguous. Herein, by simply controlling synthesis temperature, a bimetallic PBA&#8208;derived O,N&#8208;codoped Ni&#8211;Fe carbide, can be well tuned to optimize structure and OER performance. Importantly, by a series of ex situ and in situ investigations, real active species of NiFeOxHy are in situ formed on the surface during the OER, which reveals a &#8220;pre&#8208;catalyst&#8221; role of O,N&#8208;codoped Ni&#8211;Fe carbides. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to highly efficient Zn&#8211;air batteries and outplays its RuO2 counterpart. When applied to photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation as the co&#8208;catalyst, it improves the performance of the BiVO4 photoanode by enhancing hole collecting and transporting ability. We believe this research not only provides a highly efficient and low&#8208;cost electrocatalyst for the OER, but also unveils the &#8220;pre&#8208;catalyst&#8221; role of PBA&#8208;derived materials in energy&#8208;storage and conversion devices.

      <dc:description>
A combined effort: A series of multi&#8208;component X/W2C@X,N&#8208;C hybrid catalysts have been prepared from polyoxometalates (POMs) and dicyandiamide (DCA) to systematically investigate the electrocatalytic activity of triiodide reduction in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Different components in the catalysts promote photovoltaic performance by a synergistic effect. The electronegativity of the dopants can directly influence the catalytic activity of the catalysts.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component tungsten carbide&#8208;based hybrid materials featuring different heteroatom dopants coated with X,N dual&#8208;doped carbon layers (X/W2C@X,N&#8208;C, XWXNC) were prepared by selecting Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) (NH4)n[XW12O40] (X=Co, Si, Ge, B, and P) and dicyandiamide (DCA) as precursors. The electrocatalytic activity of these nanocomposites as counter electrode (CE) catalysts for dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was systematically investigated. Structure characterizations show that X,N heteroatoms were successfully introduced into the W2C and carbon frameworks. The obtained X,N dual&#8208;doped carbon layers were modified and loaded with W2C nanoparticles, promoting the improvement of catalytic performance by a synergistic effect. The consequence of photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is CoWCoNC (6.68&#8201;%)&gt;SiWSiNC (6.56&#8201;%)&gt;GeWGeNC (6.49&#8201;%)&gt;BWBNC (6.45&#8201;%)&gt;PWPNC (6.20&#8201;%)&gt;WNC (6.05&#8201;%). With the increase in electronegativity of the dopants, the photovoltaic performance decreases in a reverse order. This work provides a shortcut to the rational design of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for DSSCs.

      <title>3D Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Encapsulated Metallic Nickel&#8211;Iron Alloy Nanoparticles for Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Ni3Fe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in 3D porous N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel with appropriate nitrogen content was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal assembly followed by a calcination process. The strong electronic interactions between Ni3Fe and N&#8208;doped graphene induces the redistribution of charge on the interface and simultaneously modulates the electronic structure, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER and ORR.







Abstract
It is extremely desirable to explore high&#8208;efficient, affordable and robust oxygen electrocatalysts toward rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). A 3D porous nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene encapsulated metallic Ni3Fe alloy nanoparticles aerogel (Ni3Fe&#8208;GA1) was constructed through a facile hydrothermal assembly and calcination process. Benefiting from 3D porous configuration with great accessibility, high electrical conductivity, abundant active sites, optimal nitrogen content and strong electronic interactions at the Ni3Fe/N&#8208;doped graphene heterointerface, the obtained aerogel showed outstanding catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, it exhibited an overpotential of 239&#8197;mV to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER, simultaneously providing a positive onset potential of 0.93&#8197;V within a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.8&#8197;V for ORR. Accordingly, when employed in the aqueous ZABs, Ni3Fe&#8208;GA1 achieved higher power density and superior reversibility than Pt/C&#8722;IrO2 catalyst, making it a potential candidate for rechargeable ZABs.

      <title>Integrated Ultrafine Co0.85Se in Carbon Nanofibers: An Efficient and Robust Bifunctional Catalyst for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Teamwork! Ultrafine Co0.85Se nanoparticles encapsulated into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), Co0.85Se@CNFs, are reported as an excellent bifunctional catalyst with superior catalytic activity (see figure; E=measured potential, i=current, R=ohmic resistance from electrochemical impedance spectra, RHE=reversible hydrogen electrode). This study opens a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient and robust nonprecious transition&#8208;metal selenides for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal selenides are emerging as alternative bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); however, their activity and stability are still less than desirable. Herein, ultrafine Co0.85Se nanoparticles encapsulated into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), Co0.85Se@CNFs, is reported as an integrated bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. This catalyst exhibits a low OER potential of 1.58&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (EJ=10,&#8201;OER) to achieve a current density (J) of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high ORR potential of 0.84&#8197;V vs. RHE (EJ=&#8722;1,&#8201;ORR) to reach &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Thus, the potential between EJ=10,&#8201;OER and EJ=&#8722;1,&#8201;ORR is only 0.74&#8197;V, indicating considerable bifunctional activity. The excellent bifunctionality can be attributed to high electronic conduction, abundant electrochemically active sites, and the synergistic effect of Co0.85Se and CNFs. Furthermore, this Co0.85Se@CNFs catalyst displays good cycling stability for both OER and ORR. This study paves a new way for the rational design of hybrid catalysts composed of transition&#8208;metal selenides and carbon materials for efficiently catalyzing OER and ORR.

Ultrafine Co&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Se nanoparticles encapsulated into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), Co&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Se@CNFs, are reported as an excellent bifunctional catalyst with superior catalytic activity (see figure; &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;=measured potential, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;=current, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;=ohmic resistance from electrochemical impedance spectra, RHE=reversible hydrogen electrode). This study opens a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient and robust nonprecious transition&#8208;metal selenides for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition&#8208;metal selenides are emerging as alternative bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); however, their activity and stability are still less than desirable. Herein, ultrafine Co&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Se nanoparticles encapsulated into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), Co&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Se@CNFs, is reported as an integrated bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. This catalyst exhibits a low OER potential of 1.58&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;=10,&#8201;OER&lt;/sub&gt;) to achieve a current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;) of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a high ORR potential of 0.84&#8197;V vs. RHE (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;=&#8722;1,&#8201;ORR&lt;/sub&gt;) to reach &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, the potential between &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;=10,&#8201;OER&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;=&#8722;1,&#8201;ORR&lt;/sub&gt; is only 0.74&#8197;V, indicating considerable bifunctional activity. The excellent bifunctionality can be attributed to high electronic conduction, abundant electrochemically active sites, and the synergistic effect of Co&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Se and CNFs. Furthermore, this Co&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Se@CNFs catalyst displays good cycling stability for both OER and ORR. This study paves a new way for the rational design of hybrid catalysts composed of transition&#8208;metal selenides and carbon materials for efficiently catalyzing OER and ORR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Co&#8208;based nanoalloys: A strategy is proposed to design efficient Co&#8208;M (M=Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, Ir, and Rh) nanoalloys as the oxygen reduction reaction catalysts by using density functional theory calculations. Through the Sabatier analysis, the overpotential as a function of &#916;GOH* is identified as a quantitative descriptor for analyzing the effect of dopants and atomic structures on the activity of the Co&#8208;based nanoalloys.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based nanoalloys show potential applications as nanocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but improving their activity is still a great challenge. In this paper, a strategy is proposed to design efficient Co&#8208;M (M=Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, Ir, and Rh) nanoalloys as ORR catalysts by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Through the Sabatier analysis, the overpotential as a function of &#916;GOH* is identified as a quantitative descriptor for analyzing the effect of dopants and atomic structures on the activity of the Co&#8208;based nanoalloys. By adopting the suitable dopants and atomic structures, &#916;GOH* accompanied by overpotential could be adjusted to the optimal range to enhance the activity of the Co&#8208;based nanoalloys. With this strategy, the core&#8211;shell structured Ag42Co13 nanoalloy is predicted to have the highest catalytic activity for ORR among these Co&#8208;based nanoalloys. To give a deeper insight into the properties of Ag&#8208;Co nanoalloys, the structure, thermal stability, and reaction mechanism of Ag&#8208;Co nanoalloys with different compositions are also studied by using molecular simulations and DFT calculations. It is found that core&#8211;shell Ag42Co13 exhibits the highest structural and thermal stability among these Ag&#8208;Co nanoalloys. In addition, the core&#8211;shell Ag42Co13 shows the lowest ORR reaction energy barriers among these Ag&#8208;Co nanoalloys. It is expected that this kind of strategy could provide a viable way to design highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts in extensive applications.

      <title>A Facile Route for Constructing Effective Cu&#8722;Nx Active Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction electrocatalyst: In a quest to identify viable copper/nitrogen&#8208;based electrocatalysts, distinct Cu+&#8722;N2 and Cu2+&#8722;N4 sites have been obtained by etching of a pristine Cu&#8722;N/C precursor with sulfuric acid or nitric acid, respectively. The Cu+&#8722;N2 site is shown to be more active for oxygen reduction.







Abstract
The coordination number between copper and nitrogen in copper/nitrogen&#8208;based electrocatalysts is important for boosting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it is difficult to control unsaturated copper/nitrogen constructions as well as to compare their ORR performances in similar carbon matrices in a simple yet efficient manner. In this study, we have easily attained two types of Cu+&#8722;N2 and Cu2+&#8722;N4 constructions simply by etching pyrolyzed Cu&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework nanoleaves (Cu&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L) with sulfuric acid or nitric acid, respectively. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were recorded to further confirm the different copper/nitrogen constructions after the different acid treatments. Electrochemical studies have demonstrated that Cu+&#8722;N2 sites are more active in boosting the ORR performance than Cu2+&#8722;N4 sites. Furthermore, Cu&#8722;N/C&#8722;H2SO4, used as an air cathode in a zinc&#8208;air battery, exhibited excellent performance and stability.

      <title>Hollow Nanotube Ru/Cu2+1O Supported on Copper Foam as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Overall water splitting: Ru&#8208;doped Cu2+1O vertically arranged nanotube arrays in situ grown on Cu foam (Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF) are reported and further investigated for their catalytic properties for overall water splitting. The Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF presents ultrahigh catalytic activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions, and it exhibits a small overpotential of 32&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the HER, and only needs 210&#8197;mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the OER.







Abstract
Hydrogen energy is considered as one of the ideal clean energies for solving the energy shortage and environmental issues, and developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting to produce hydrogen is still a huge challenge.

Importantly, the alkaline electrolyzer using Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst only needs 1.53&#8197;V voltage to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is much lower than the benchmark of IrO2(+)/Pt(&#8722;) counterpart (1.64&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The excellent performance of the Ru/Cu2+1O NT/CuF catalyst is attributed to its high conductive substrate and special Ru&#8208;doped nanotube structure, which provides a high electrochemical active surface area and 3D gas diffusion channel.

      <title>Interfacial Engineering FeOOH/CoO Nanoneedle Array for Efficient Overall Water Splitting Driven by Solar Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Soak up the sun: A vertically aligned FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle array with a clear synergistic interface for solar energy&#8208;driven water splitting was engineered by a simple impregnation method.







Abstract
Interface engineering has been applied as an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance because of the strong coupling and synergistic effects between individual components. Here, we engineered vertically aligned FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle array with a synergistic interface between FeOOH and CoO on Ni foam (NF) by a simple impregnation method. The synthesized FeOOH/CoO exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. For the overall water splitting, the bifunctional FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle catalyst requires only a cell voltage of 1.58&#8197;V to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is much lower than that required for IrO2//Pt/C (1.68&#8197;V). The FeOOH/CoO catalyst has been successfully applied for solar cell&#8208;driven water electrolysis, revealing its great potential for commercial hydrogen production and solar energy storage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interface engineering has been applied as an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance because of the strong coupling and synergistic effects between individual components. Here, we engineered vertically aligned FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle array with a synergistic interface between FeOOH and CoO on Ni foam (NF) by a simple impregnation method. The synthesized FeOOH/CoO exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. For the overall water splitting, the bifunctional FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle catalyst requires only a cell voltage of 1.58&#8197;V to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much lower than that required for IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//Pt/C (1.68&#8197;V). The FeOOH/CoO catalyst has been successfully applied for solar cell&#8208;driven water electrolysis, revealing its great potential for commercial hydrogen production and solar energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D Carbon Foam Supported Edge&#8208;Rich N&#8208;Doped MoS2 Nanoflakes for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
More active sites! An edge&#8208;rich 3D MoS2&#8208;CF (CF=carbon foam) composite was successfully fabricated, and it exhibited high electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential (&#951;10(basic)=92, &#951;10(acidic)=155&#8197;mV) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both alkaline and acidic media.







Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is one of the most promising alternatives to the Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, its performance is currently limited by insufficient active edge sites and poor electron transport. Hence, enormous efforts have been devoted to constructing more active edge sites and improving conductivity to obtain enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Herein, the 3D carbon foam (denoted as CF) supported edge&#8208;rich N&#8208;doped MoS2 nanoflakes were successfully fabricated by using the commercially available polyurethane foam (PU) as the 3D substrate and PMo12O403&#8722; clusters (denoted as PMo12) as the Mo source through redox polymerization, followed by sulfurization. Owing to the uniform distribution of nanoscale Mo sources and 3D carbon foam substrate, the as&#8208;prepared MoS2&#8208;CF composite possessed well&#8208;exposed active edge sites and enhanced electrical conductivity. Systematic investigation demonstrated that the MoS2&#8208;CF composite showed high HER performance with a low overpotential of 92&#8197;mV in 1.0&#8201;m KOH and 155&#8197;mV in 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work offers a new pathway for the rational design of MoS2&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts.

      <title>Controlled Synthesis of Ni&#8208;Doped MoS2 Hybrid Electrode for Synergistically Enhanced Water&#8208;Splitting Process</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional water&#8208;splitting catalyst: A novel one&#8208;step hydrothermal strategy is developed for the synthesis of Ni&#8208;modified MoS2 hybrid catalysts grown on carbon cloth. These exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties for overall water splitting owing to their remarkable conductivity, abundant active sites, and synergistic effect of Ni doping.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, and earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts for overall water splitting remains a challenge. In this work, Ni&#8208;modified MoS2 hybrid catalysts are grown on carbon cloth (Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;S@CC) through a one&#8208;step hydrothermal treatment. The optimized Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;S@CC catalyst shows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a low overpotential of 168&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8201;m KOH, which is lower than those of Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;S@CC (1:1), Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;S@CC (3:1), and pure MoS2. Significantly, the Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;S@CC hybrid catalyst also displays outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low overpotential of 320&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and remarkable long&#8208;term stability for 30&#8197;h at a constant current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental results and theoretical analysis based on density functional theory demonstrate that the excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed mainly to the remarkable conductivity, abundant active sites, and synergistic effect of the Ni&#8208;doped MoS2. This work sheds light on a unique strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance and stable electrocatalysts for water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.

      <title>Self&#8208;Supported Nanoporous Au3Cu Electrode with Enriched Gold on Surface for Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanoporous alloys: A self&#8208;supported surface&#8208;rich gold nanoporous Au3Cu electrode is subjected to electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, showing a Faradaic efficiency of 98.12&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) toward CO.







Abstract
The key to the electrochemical conversion of CO2 lies in the development of efficient electrocatalysts with ease of operation, good conductivity, and rich active sites that fulfil the desired reaction direction and selectivity. Herein, an oxidative etching of Au20Cu80 alloy is used for the synthesis of a nanoporous Au3Cu alloy, representing a facile strategy for tuning the surface electronic properties and altering the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. HRTEM, XPS, and EXAFS results reveal that the curved surface of the synthesized nanoporous Au3Cu is rich in gold with unsaturated coordination conditions. It can be used directly as a self&#8208;supported electrode for CO2 reduction, and exhibits high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.12&#8201;% toward CO at a potential of &#8722;0.7&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The FE is 1.47 times that over the as&#8208;made single nanoporous Au. Density functional theory reveals that *CO has a relatively long distance on the surface of nanoporous Au3Cu, making desorption of CO easier and avoiding CO poisoning. The Hirshfeld charge distribution shows that the Au atoms have a negative charge and the Cu atoms exhibit a positive charge, which separately bond to the C atom and O atom in the *COOH intermediate through a bidentate mode. This affords the lowest *COOH adsorption free energy and low desorption energy for CO molecules.

      <title>Platinum Oxide Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution: Influence of Platinum Valence State</title>
      <dc:description>
Valence importance: Platinum oxide nanoparticles deposited on carbon nitride nanosheets outperform Pt/C toward the hydrogen evolution reaction in acid. The PtIV species was found to be far more active than PtII.







Abstract
Electrochemical hydrogen generation is a rising prospect for future renewable energy storage and conversion. Platinum remains a leading choice of catalyst, but because of its high cost and low natural abundance, it is critical to optimize its use. In the present study, platinum oxide nanoparticles of approximately 2&#8197;nm in diameter are deposited on carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets by thermal refluxing of C3N4 and PtCl2 or PtCl4 in water. These nanoparticles exhibit apparent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. Interestingly, the HER activity increases with increasing Pt4+ concentration in the nanoparticles, and the optimized catalyst even outperforms commercial Pt/C, exhibiting an overpotential of only &#8722;7.7&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of &#8722;26.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The results from this study suggest that the future design of platinum oxide catalysts should strive to maximize the Pt4+ sites and minimize the formation of the less active Pt2+ species.

In the present study, platinum oxide nanoparticles of approximately 2&#8197;nm in diameter are deposited on carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets by thermal refluxing of C3N4 and PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or PtCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in water. These nanoparticles exhibit apparent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. Interestingly, the HER activity increases with increasing Pt&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the nanoparticles, and the optimized catalyst even outperforms commercial Pt/C, exhibiting an overpotential of only &#8722;7.7&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a Tafel slope of &#8722;26.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The results from this study suggest that the future design of platinum oxide catalysts should strive to maximize the Pt&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and minimize the formation of the less active Pt&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species.&lt;/p&gt;

Sustainability: Electrocatalysis will play a key role in a proposed man&#8208;made, sustainable future. An energy infrastructure without using fossil fuels is a blue map. It can be a hydrogen&#8208;based energy system, involving the hydrogen production from solar&#8208;driven water electrolysis and the hydrogen fuel cell, or it can be a closed carbon cycle using carbon dioxide electrolysis techniques. Zero&#8208;carbon emission cannot be achieved without electrocatalysis.

      <title>Frontispiece: Bifunctional Catalysts for Reversible Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxygen catalysts are notorious for their high overpotential and sluggish kinetics. Both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) consist of four proton&#8208;coupled/decoupled electron&#8208;transfer steps with a bond&#8208;breaking (ORR) or of a bond&#8208;forming (OER) step. The rate&#8208;determining steps and intermediates for OER and ORR are different, and the binding energy between the active sites and intermediates are not identical; thus, it is tough to achieve identical oxygen binding energies of the intermediates close to the theoretical equilibrium potential. A good bifunctional oxygen catalyst should have multiple redox centers that could be responsible for OER and ORR. Composites with multiactive centers and conductive supports could offer new opportunities for bifunctional air electrode. For more details see the Review by S. Wang, Y. Cheng et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;3906&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Nonmetal Doping as a Robust Route for Boosting the Hydrogen Evolution of Metal&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) undergoes large overpotentials for achieving preferable efficiency due to its sluggish dynamics. As such, highly active electrocatalysts are often needed for its acceleration. Despite the significant progress achieved on the synthesis of transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts, their activity is still far from their Pt&#8208;based counterparts. In their Minireview article on page&#8197;3930&#8197;ff., C. He et&#8197;al. describe current methods used for doping nonmetals into transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;based nanomaterials and their performances in the HER. Doping nonmetals can efficiently tune the electronic structures of the TM and, therefore, optimize the Gibbs free energy of the TM for adsorption of H* intermediates, in turn boosting the HER of the TM.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The increasingly serious energy crisis&lt;/b&gt; has inspired researchers to pursue new methods towards renewable energy. Of the clean and sustainable energy generation technologies, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) stand out owing to their high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency, high volumetric power density, and zero carbon footprint. In their Minireview on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201904233page&#8197;3973&#8197;ff.&lt;/a&gt;, H. Chen, Z. Wei et&#8197;al. describe the latest strategies for enhancing the activity in PEMFCs. In addition, with special emphasis on devastating catalyst poisoning, up&#8208;to&#8208;data tactics for elevating the stability and poison&#8208;tolerance are introduced.

      <title>Bifunctional Catalysts for Reversible Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional oxygen catalysts require multiactive centers to catalyze both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Metal/heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon composites with abundant active centers have been proven to have outstanding performance when replacing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based bifunctional oxygen catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) and reversible fuel cells (RFCs) rely on the bifunctional oxygen catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finding efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts is the ultimate goal and it has attracted a great deal of attention. The dilemma is that a good ORR catalyst is not necessarily efficient for OER, and vice versa. Thus, the development of a new type of bifunctional oxygen catalysts should ensure that the catalysts exhibit high activity for both OER and ORR. Composites with multicomponents for active centers supported on highly conductive matrices could be able to meet the challenges and offering new opportunities. In this Review, the evolution of bifunctional catalysts is summarized and discussed aiming to deliver high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials.

      <title>Nonmetal Doping as a Robust Route for Boosting the Hydrogen Evolution of Metal&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Go electro! The current methods used for doping nonmetals into transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;based nanomaterials and their performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been summarized. Doping nonmetals can efficiently tune the electronic structures of the TM and, therefore, optimize the Gibbs free energy of the TM for adsorption of H* intermediates, in turn boosting the HER of the TM (see figure).







Abstract
Recently, nonmetal doping has exhibited its great potential for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts. To this end, this work overviews the recent achievements made on the design and development of the nonmetal&#8208;doped TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and their performance for the HER. It is also shown that by rationally doping nonmetal elements, the electronic structures of TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts can be effectively tuned and in turn the Gibbs free energy of the TM for adsorption of H* intermediates (&#916;GH*) optimized, consequently enhancing the intrinsic activity of TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Notably, we highlight that concurrently doping two nonmetal elements can continuously and precisely regulate the electronic structures of the TM, thereby maximizing the activity for HER. Moreover, nonmetal doping also accounts for enhancing the physical properties of the TM (i.e. surface area). Therefore, nonmetal doping is a robust strategy for simultaneous regulation of the chemical and physical features of the TM.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, nonmetal doping has exhibited its great potential for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts. To this end, this work overviews the recent achievements made on the design and development of the nonmetal&#8208;doped TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and their performance for the HER. It is also shown that by rationally doping nonmetal elements, the electronic structures of TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts can be effectively tuned and in turn the Gibbs free energy of the TM for adsorption of H* intermediates (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H*&lt;/sub&gt;) optimized, consequently enhancing the intrinsic activity of TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Notably, we highlight that concurrently doping two nonmetal elements can continuously and precisely regulate the electronic structures of the TM, thereby maximizing the activity for HER. Moreover, nonmetal doping also accounts for enhancing the physical properties of the TM (i.e. surface area). Therefore, nonmetal doping is a robust strategy for simultaneous regulation of the chemical and physical features of the TM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amorphous Oxide Nanostructures for Advanced Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Amorphous vs. crystalline: With unique structural and electronic properties, such as disordered ordering, more dangling bonds, and oxygen vacancies, and abundant surface defects, amorphous oxides have found wide electrocatalytic applications ranging from the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, the oxygen reduction reaction, to the CO2 and nitrogen reduction reactions. In this minireview, the preparation methods, research progress, and perspectives for amorphous oxide nanostructures are demonstrated.







Abstract
Amorphous oxides have attracted special attention as advanced electrocatalysts owing to their unique local structural flexibility and attractive electrocatalytic properties. With abundant randomly oriented bonds and surface&#8208;exposed defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) as active catalytic sites, the adsorption/desorption of reactants can be optimized, leading to superior catalytic activities. Amorphous oxide materials have found wide electrocatalytic applications ranging from hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution to oxygen reduction, CO2 electroreduction and nitrogen electroreduction. The amorphous oxide electrocatalysts even outperform their crystalline counterparts in terms of electrocatalytic activity and stability. Despite of the merits and achievements for amorphous oxide electrocatalysts, there are still issues and challenges existing for amorphous oxide electrocatalysts. There are rarely reviews specifically focusing on amorphous oxide electrocatalysts and therefore it is imperative to have a comprehensive overview of the research progress and to better understand the achievements and issues with amorphous oxide electrocatalysts. In this minireview, several general preparation methods for amorphous oxides are first introduced. Then, the achievements in amorphous oxides for several important electrocatalytic reactions are summarized. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of amorphous oxide electrocatalysts are outlined.

      <title>Solid&#8208;State Conversion Synthesis of Advanced Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>

Solid&#8208;state conversion synthesis is reviewed to realize the precise manipulation of electronic structure and synergistic manipulation of electronic and micro&#8208;/nanostructures. This Minireview also aims to help the understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationships and construct efficient water splitting electrocatalysts (see figure).







Abstract
Electrolytic water technology is promising for sustainable energy utilization, but the lack of efficient electrocatalysts retards its application. The intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts is determined by its electronic structure, whereas the apparent activity can be further optimized by reasonable design on micro&#8208;/nanostructures of electrocatalysts. The core goal of electrocatalytic research is to reveal the relationship between the structure and performance of electrocatalysts, which is also the basis of reasonable design and construction of efficient electrocatalysts. Traditional synthetic methods, namely bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down routes, usually induce the change of different structural parameters at the same time. The solid&#8208;state conversion strategy, which is converts solid precursors into target materials through chemical reactions, has been widely adopted to produce materials with precisely controllable structures. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in the solid&#8208;state conversion synthesis of water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts. First, the basis of solid&#8208;state conversion chemistry is introduced. Then, the specific methods of precise control of electronic structure by solid&#8208;state conversion and the relationship between electronic structure and performance are summarized. Based on the understanding of the electronic structure&#8211;performance relationship, synergistic regulation of electronic structure and micro&#8208;/nanostructures by solid&#8208;state conversion to achieve the copromotion of intrinsic activity and apparent activity are described. Finally, the remaining challenges in this field are discussed, and future research directions are proposed as well.

      <title>Recent Progress in Precious Metal&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Materials towards the Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Activity, Stability, and Anti&#8208;Poisoning</title>
      <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;free electrocatalysts: High stability and poison&#8208;tolerance are often in contradiction for electrocatalysts activity. Therefore, a trade&#8208;off should be made for developing cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials for ORR catalysis in commercial polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).







Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) depends heavily on the development of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts to replace the traditional Pt&#8208;based materials. Among the numerous candidates of ORR electrocatalysts, precious metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials have received ever&#8208;increasing attention for their unique electronic features, tunable nanostructures, and robustness. Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to raising the intrinsic properties of precious metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials, there exists a lot of room for them to be improved in activity, stability, and poison&#8208;tolerance. In this Minireview, the latest strategies for enhancing activity by increasing the accessible active sites and promoting the intrinsic activity have been summarized. In addition, with special emphasis on devastating catalyst poisoning, up&#8208;to&#8208;data tactics for elevating the stability and poison&#8208;tolerance are introduced. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are also presented.

      <title>Stoichiometry&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Nanoparticulate Mixed&#8208;Metal Oxyhydroxide Oxygen Evolving Catalysts by Electrochemistry in Aqueous Nanodroplets</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrode materials: Stoichiometry&#8208;controlled nanoparticulate mixed&#8208;metal (Co, Fe, Ni) oxyhydroxides were prepared electrochemically by electrolysis of aqueous nanodroplets (AnDs), each containing 10&#8197;s of attoliters of fluid. The prepared particles exhibited homogeneous distribution of component metals without phase segregation, and demonstrated superior catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction compared to the thin film counterparts of the same composition (see figure).







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;metal oxyhydroxides&#8212;especially those of Ni and Fe&#8212;are one of the most active classes of materials known for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, nanoparticulate mixed metal oxyhydroxides (of Ni, Fe, and Co) were prepared on an electrode surface by electrochemical reaction of a precursor solution encapsulated in aqueous nanodroplets (AnDs), with each of the droplets containing 10&#8197;s of attoliters of fluid. Electrode reactions and synthesis can be monitored in situ by electrochemistry as single AnD stochastically lands and interacts with the working electrode. Resultant metal oxyhydroxide nanoparticles can be size and composition controlled precisely by modulating the precursor solution stored in the AnD. Nanoparticulate metal oxyhydroxides were implemented as catalysts for the OER and exhibited superior catalysis compared to their thin&#8208;film counterparts, demonstrating a hundred&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold enhancement in atom efficiency at comparable turnover rates.

      <title>Atomically Dispersed Pt on Screw&#8208;like Pd/Au Core&#8208;shell Nanowires for Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanowires: Atomically dispersed Pt on screw&#8208;like Pd/Au core&#8211;shell nanowires exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activities towards acidic HER and alkaline ORR, even comparable to commercial Pt/C (see figure).







Abstract
Engineering noble metal nanostructures at the atomic level can significantly optimize their electrocatalytic performance and remarkably reduce their usage. We report the synthesis of atomically dispersed Pt on screw&#8208;like Pd/Au nanowires by using ultrafine Pd nanowires as seeds. Au can selectively grow on the surface of Pd nanowires by an island growth pattern to fabricate surface defect sites to load atomically dispersed Pt, which can be confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements and aberration corrected HRTEM images. The nanowires with 2.74&#8197;at&#8201;% Pt exhibit superior HER properties in acidic solution with an overpotential of 20.6&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and enhanced alkaline ORR performance with a mass activity over 15&#8197;times greater than the commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) catalysts.

We report the synthesis of atomically dispersed Pt on screw&#8208;like Pd/Au nanowires by using ultrafine Pd nanowires as seeds. Au can selectively grow on the surface of Pd nanowires by an island growth pattern to fabricate surface defect sites to load atomically dispersed Pt, which can be confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements and aberration corrected HRTEM images. The nanowires with 2.74&#8197;at&#8201;% Pt exhibit superior HER properties in acidic solution with an overpotential of 20.6&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and enhanced alkaline ORR performance with a mass activity over 15&#8197;times greater than the commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated Bismuth Oxide Ultrathin Nanosheets/Carbon Foam Electrode for Highly Selective and Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to HCOOH</title>
      <dc:description>
Another dimension! An integrated 3D bismuth oxide ultrathin nanosheets/carbon foam electrode with a unique array foam architecture for highly efficient mass transfer and optimized exposed active sites has been designed by a sponge effect and N&#8208;atom anchor for energy&#8208;efficient, long&#8208;term durable, and selective electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to HCOOH (see figure).







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into formic acid (HCOOH) is of particular interest as a hydrogen carrier and chemical feedstock. However, its conversion is limited by a high overpotential and low stability due to undesirable catalysts and electrode design. Herein, an integrated 3D bismuth oxide ultrathin nanosheets/carbon foam electrode is designed by a sponge effect and N&#8208;atom anchor for energy&#8208;efficient and selective electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to HCOOH for the first time. Benefitting from the unique 3D array foam architecture for highly efficient mass transfer, and optimized exposed active sites, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations, the integrated electrode achieves high electrocatalytic performance, including superior partial current density and faradaic efficiency (up to 94.1&#8201;%) at a moderate overpotential as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of 60.3&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability.

      <title>Nanobundles of Iron Phosphide Fabricated by Direct Phosphorization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as an Efficient Hydrogen&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
MOFs: Nanobundles of iron phosphide composites constructed by quasi&#8208;paralleled 1D nanorods are obtained by the direct phosphorization of an iron&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework. The hierarchical porous structure and rich directional channels can benefit the mass transport and hydrogen gas release, thus promoting the electrochemical processes in hydrogen evolution reaction (see graphic).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphides (TMPs) have been considered as attractive electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their earth&#8208;abundance and remarkable catalytic activity. As a representative type of precursors, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide ideal plateaus for the design of nanostructured TMPs. In this work, the hierarchically structured iron phosphide nanobundles (FeP&#8208;500) were fabricated by one&#8208;step phosphorization of an iron&#8208;based MOF (MET(Fe)) precursor. The derived FeP&#8208;500 nanobundles were constructed by quasi&#8208;paralleled one&#8208;dimensional nanorods with uneven surface, which provided channels for electrolyte penetration, mass transport, and effective exposure of active sites during the water&#8208;splitting process. With the addition of conductive Super P, the obtained FeP&#8208;500&#8208;S exhibited a good electrocatalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte (1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH). Furthermore, to investigate the influence of secondary metal doping, a series of isoreticular MOF precursors and bimetallic TMPs were fabricated. The results indicated that the catalytic performance is structure dominated.

      <title>Interfacial Engineering in PtNiCo/NiCoS Nanowires for Enhanced Electrocatalysis and Electroanalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Multicomponent active sites have been fabricated by creating a sulfide structure on 1D PtNiCo trimetallic nanowires (NWs), to give a PtNiCo/NiCoS interface NWs (IFNWs). Owing to the presence of sulfide interfaces, the PtNiCo/NiCoS IFNWs enable an impressive methanol/ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR/EOR) performance and excellent anti&#8208;CO poisoning tolerance.







Abstract
Searching for new anti&#8208;poisoning Pt&#8208;based catalysts with enhanced activity for alcohol oxidation is the key in direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). However, in the traditional strategy for designing bimetallic or multimetallic alloy is still difficult to achieve a satisfactory heterogeneous electrocatalyst because the activity often depends on only the surface atoms. Herein, we fabricate the multicomponent active sites by creating a sulfide structure on 1D PtNiCo trimetallic nanowires (NWs), to give a PtNiCo/NiCoS interface NWs (IFNWs). Owing to the presence of sulfide interfaces, the PtNiCo/NiCoS IFNWs enable an impressive methanol/ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR/EOR) performance and excellent anti&#8208;CO poisoning tolerance. They have the MOR and EOR mass activities of 2.25&#8197;Amg&#8208;1Pt and 1.62&#8197;Amg&#8208;1Pt, around 1.26, 3.21 and 1.46, 2.96&#8197;times higher than those of PtNiCo NWs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. CO&#8208;stripping and XPS measurements further demonstrate that the new interfacial structure and optimal bonding of Pt&#8722;CO can result in accelerating the removal of surface adsorbed carbonaceous intermediates. Moreover, such a unique structure has also demonstrated a much&#8208;improved ability for the electrochemical detection of some important molecules (H2O2 and NH2NH2).

      <title>Ultrafine PtRu Dilute Alloy Nanodendrites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation</title>

Trace Ru atoms evenly dispersed in ultrafine Pt nanodendrites were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot method. For the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction, the PtRu dilute alloy nanodendrites exhibited higher forward peak current density and better stability than pure&#8208;Pt nanodendrites, commercial PtRu/C and commercial Pt/C catalysts (see scheme).







Abstract
Dilute alloy nanostructures have been demonstrated to possess distinct catalytic properties. Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;induced reduction is one effective synthesis strategy to construct dilute alloys and modify the catalytic performance of the host metal. Herein, we report the synthesis of ultrafine PtRu dilute alloy nanodendrites (PtRu NDs, molar ratio Ru/Pt is 1:199) by the reduction of RuIII ions induced by Pt metal. For the methanol oxidation reaction, PtRu NDs showed the highest forward peak current density (2.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1.14 A/mgPt) and the best stability compared to those of pure&#8208;Pt nanodendrites (pure&#8208;Pt NDs), commercial PtRu/C and commercial Pt/C catalysts.

      <title>Underevaluated Solvent Effects in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by FeIII Chloride Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin</title>
      <dc:description>
The simple Fe chloride tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin displays a large electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity difference in acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, and benzonitrile. Several solvent effects were considered, but none of these effects alone can explain the large activity difference. This result highlights the significant but underevaluated solvent effects in the CO2 reduction (see figure).







Abstract
FeIII chloride tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (1) is known to have poor electrocatalytic activity for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in dimethylformamide. In this work, we re&#8208;examined Fe porphyrin 1 as a CO2 reduction catalyst in various solvents. Our results show that 1 displays fairly high electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity in acetonitrile with a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4.2&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1. On the other hand, 1 shows a modest activity in propylene carbonate, and is inefficient to catalyze CO2 reduction in benzonitrile, dimethylformamide, and tetrahydrofuran. Several solvent effects were considered, but none of these effects alone can explain the observed large activity difference of 1 for CO2 reduction in these solvents. Based on the results, it is suggested that more care should be paid when comparing different CO2 reduction catalysts because solvent effects are significant and are underevaluated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The simple Fe chloride&lt;/b&gt; tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin displays a large electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity difference in acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, and benzonitrile. Several solvent effects were considered, but none of these effects alone can explain the large activity difference. This result highlights the significant but underevaluated solvent effects in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (see figure).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; chloride tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is known to have poor electrocatalytic activity for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in dimethylformamide. In this work, we re&#8208;examined Fe porphyrin &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; as a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalyst in various solvents. Our results show that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displays fairly high electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity in acetonitrile with a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a modest activity in propylene carbonate, and is inefficient to catalyze CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in benzonitrile, dimethylformamide, and tetrahydrofuran. Several solvent effects were considered, but none of these effects alone can explain the observed large activity difference of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in these solvents. Based on the results, it is suggested that more care should be paid when comparing different CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalysts because solvent effects are significant and are underevaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Competitive Reactivity of Tautomers in the Degradation of Organophosphates by Imidazole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Making pesticides safer: The harmful impact of pesticides on human health and the environment necessitates the development of efficient degradation processes. Both inductive effects and hydrogen bonding by the substituents on imidazole derivatives are shown to influence barriers and reaction mechanisms of these catalyst scaffolds for the detoxification of organophosphates.







Abstract
The harmful impact caused by pesticides on human health and the environment necessitates the development of efficient degradation processes and control of prohibited stocks of such substances. Organophosphates (OPs) are among the most used agrochemicals in the world and their degradation can proceed through several possible pathways. Investigating the reactivity of OPs with nucleophilic species allows one to propose new and efficient catalyst scaffolds for use in detoxification. In light of the remarkable catalytic activity of imidazole (IMZ) at promoting dephosphorylation processes of OPs, the reactivity of 4(5)&#8208;hydroxymethylimidazole (HMZ) with diethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrophenylphosphate (DEDNPP) and Paraoxon are evaluated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. It is observed that HMZ is an efficient and regiospecific catalyst with reactivity modulated by competing tautomers. To propose an optimal IMZ&#8208;based catalyst, quantum chemical calculations were performed for monosubstituted 4(5)IMZ derivatives that might cleave DEDNPP. Both inductive effects and hydrogen bonding by the substituents are shown to influence barriers and mechanisms.

      <title>Elucidating the Structural Chemistry of a Hysteretic Iron(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Compound From its Copper(II) and Zinc(II) Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>
In a spin: Structurally different [ML2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (L=2,6&#8208;bis[5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]&#8208;pyridine; M=Fe, Cu or Zn) form the same anhydrous phase on annealing, which transforms to one of two new phases near room temperature. [ZnL2][BF4]2 shows unusual structural changes between 285&#8211;150&#8197;K, which are duplicated in its iron analogue by powder diffraction. This will contribute to the previously reported 65&#8197;K thermal hysteresis in the spin&#8208;transition shown by [FeL2][BF4]2.







Abstract
Annealing [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (L=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]pyridine) affords an anhydrous material, which undergoes a spin transition at T1/2=205&#8197;K with a 65&#8197;K thermal hysteresis loop. This occurs through a sequence of phase changes, which were monitored by powder diffraction in an earlier study. [CuL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O and [ZnL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O are not perfectly isostructural but, unlike the iron compound, they undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal dehydration upon annealing. All the annealed compounds initially adopt the same tetragonal phase but undergo a phase change near room temperature upon re&#8208;cooling. The low&#8208;temperature phase of [CuL2][BF4]2 involves ordering of its Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, to a monoclinic lattice with three unique cation sites. The zinc compound adopts a different, triclinic low&#8208;temperature phase with significant twisting of its coordination sphere, which unexpectedly becomes more pronounced as the crystal is cooled. Synchrotron powder diffraction data confirm that the structural changes in the anhydrous zinc complex are reproduced in the high&#8208;spin iron compound, before the onset of spin&#8208;crossover. This will contribute to the wide hysteresis in the spin transition of the iron complex. EPR spectra of copper&#8208;doped [Fe0.97Cu0.03L2][BF4]2 imply its low&#8208;spin phase contains two distinct cation environments in a 2:1 ratio.

      <title>Stepwise Oxidations in a Cofacial Copper(II) Porphyrin Dimer: Through Space Spin Coupling and Interplay between Metal and Radical spins</title>
      <dc:description>Cis and trans&#8208;copper(II) porphyrin dimers have been synthesized in which two Cu(II) porphyrin macrocycles are bridged through a rigid ethene&#8208;linker for possible through&#8208;space and through&#8208;bond spin&#8208;couplings between the paramagnetic Cu(II) centers.

Detailed investigations are performed here on the interactions between the two porphyrin macrocycles, between two unpaired spins of closely&#8208;spaced Cu(II) centers and also between the unpaired spins of metal and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. Spectroscopic investigations along with X&#8208;ray structure of the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex displayed strong electronic communications through the bridge between two porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals.

      <title>Cooperative and Independent Effect of Modular Functionalization on Mesomorphic Performances and Microphase Separation of Well&#8208;Designed Liquid Crystalline Diblock Copolymers</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid crystalline block copolymers (LCBCPs) are promising for developing functional materials owing to assembly of better functionality. Taking advantage of difference in reactivity between alkynyl and vinyl over temperature during hydrosilylation, a series of LCBCPs with modular functionalization of block copolymers (BCPs) are reported by independently and site&#8208;selectively attaching azobenzene moieties containing alkynyl (LC1) and Si&#8208;H (LC2) terminals into well&#8208;designed poly(styrene)&#8208;block&#8208;polybutadienes (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PBs) and poly(4&#8208;vinylphenyldimethylsilane)&#8208;block&#8208;polybutadienes (PVPDMS&#8208;b&#8208;PBs) produced from living anionic polymerization (LAP). By the principle of modular functionalization, it is demonstrated that mono&#8208;functionalized (PVPDMS&#8208;g&#8208;LC1)&#8208;b&#8208;PB and PS&#8208;b&#8208;(PB&#8208;g&#8208;LC2) not only maintain independence but also have cooperative contributions to bi&#8208;functionalized (PVPDMS&#8208;g&#8208;LC1)&#8208;b&#8208;(PB&#8208;g&#8208;LC2) in terms of mesomorphic performances and microphase separation, which is evident from DSC and POM and identified by powder X&#8208;ray diffractions. With the application of new principle of modular functionalization, local&#8208;crosslinked liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) with controlled functionality are successfully synthesized, which show well&#8208;controlled phase behaviors over molecular compositions.</dc:description>

      <title>Extraction of graphene nanostructures from Colocasia esculenta and Nelumbo nucifera leaves and surface functionalization with tin oxide: Evaluation of their antibacterial properties</title>
      <dc:description>Expeditious evolution of antimicrobial resistance in recent years has been identified as a growing concern by various health organizations around the world. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign production of highly antibacterial carbonaceous nanomaterials from  Colocasia esculenta  and  Nelumbo nucifera  leaves for the first time. After carbonization and oxidative treatment, smaller graphene domains are formed in  Colocasia esculenta  derivatives whereas larger sheet&#8208;like structures are spotted in the case of  Nelumbo nucifera  . Smaller particle size makes quantum confinement effects more prominent as evident in fine tuning of photoluminescence emission after each stage of treatment. We also demonstrate the influence of precursor materials in dictating the antibacterial properties of nano&#8208;systems. When microbicidal activity was tested against model bacteria  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  , nanocomposite derived from  Colocasia esculenta  leaves displayed higher activity than the antibiotic drug Clarithromycin (control) with a measured zone of inhibition of 40 &#177; 0.5 mm. This is one of the highest values reported in comparison with other plant&#8208;based carbon&#8208;silver nano&#8208;systems. From quantitative analysis, it is discerned that nanocomposite obtained from  Colocasia esculenta  leaves has antimicrobial efficacy equivalent to commercial antibiotic drugs and is able to eradicate bacteria at much lower concentrations when compared to those from  Nelumbo nucifera  leaves.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free, NIS&#8208;Induced Regioselective Iodophosphoryloxylation of Alkenes with P(O)&#8208;OH bonds</title>
      <dc:description>A simple and efficient method for the regioselective iodophosphoryloxylation of alkenes with P(O)&#8208;OH bonds has been established by using NIS (N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) as the iodination reagent under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The present protocol is compatible with different functional groups, and suitable for various alkenes and P(O)&#8208;OH compounds. A variety of functionalized &#946;&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;ethyl phosphinic/phosphoric acid esters are obtained in good to excellent yields, which could be further transformed to diversified building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals and functional materials .</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A simple and efficient method for the regioselective iodophosphoryloxylation of alkenes with P(O)&#8208;OH bonds has been established by using NIS (N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) as the iodination reagent under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The present protocol is compatible with different functional groups, and suitable for various alkenes and P(O)&#8208;OH compounds. A variety of functionalized &#946;&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;ethyl phosphinic/phosphoric acid esters are obtained in good to excellent yields, which could be further transformed to diversified building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals and functional materials .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Optically Triggered Control of the Charge Carrier Density in Chemically Functionalized Graphene Field Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Optically switchable graphene FET: Via van der Waals assembly of an approximately 1&#8197;nm thick azobenzene functionalized molecular nanosheets with single layer graphene, optically responsive field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated. The electrical carrier density of these devices can be modulated using optical stimuli, 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules. The azobenzene molecules were incorporated to the GFET channel by building a van der Waals heterostructure with a carbon nanomembrane (CNM), which is used as a molecular interposer to attach the azobenzene molecules. Under exposure with 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light, azobenzene molecules transition between cis and trans molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment. Thus, the effective electric field acting on the GFET channel is tuned by optical stimulation and the carrier density is modulated.

      <title>Towards atomically precise supported catalysts from monolayer&#8208;protected clusters: the critical role of the support</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the size and uniformity of metal clusters with atomic precision is essential for fine&#8208;tuning their catalytic properties, however for clusters deposited on supports such control is challenging. Here, by combining X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that supports play a crucial role in the evolution of monolayer&#8208;protected clusters into catalysts. Based on the acidic nature of the support, cluster&#8208;support interactions lead either to fragmentation of the cluster into isolated Au&#8208;ligand species or ligand&#8208;free metallic Au0 clusters. On Lewis acidic supports that bind metals strongly, the latter transformation occurs while preserving the original size of the metal cluster, as demonstrated for various Au n  sizes. These findings underline the role of the support in the design of supported catalysts, and represent an important step toward the synthesis of atomically precise supported nanomaterials with tailored physico&#8208;chemical properties.</dc:description>

      <title>BaP6N10NH:Eu2+ as a Case Study&#8211;An Imidonitridophosphate Showing Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 4&#8197;GPa and 1150&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was determined from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Doping of the title compound with Eu2+ leads to unprecedented observation of luminescence from a Eu2+&#8208;doped imidonitridophosphate.







Abstract
Barium imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized at 5&#8197;GPa and 1000&#8201;&#176;C with a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique. Ba(N3)2, P3N5 and NH4Cl were used as starting materials, applying a combination of azide and mineralizer routes. The structure elucidation of BaP6N10NH (P63, a=7.5633(11), c=8.512(2)&#8197;&#197;, Z=2) was performed by a combination of transmission electron microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Phase purity was verified by Rietveld refinement. 1H and 31P solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy are consistent with the structure model. The chemical composition was confirmed by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and CHNS analyses. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of BaP6N10NH show blue emission upon excitation with UV to blue light (&#955;em=460&#8197;nm, fwhm=2423&#8197;cm&#8722;1) representing unprecedented Eu2+&#8208;luminescence of an imidonitride.

      <title>Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;Azaproline Creates Conformationally Adaptable Proline Derivatives for pH&#8208;Responsive Collagen Triple Helices</title>
      <dc:description>
Swings both ways: Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;azaproline creates pH&#8208;responsive amino acids that change their conformation in different chemical environments through the invertibility of nitrogen. Incorporation into collagen triple helices highlighted the conformational flexibility of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline and demonstrated its potential as a novel apparatus for the functionalization of peptides and proteins.







Abstract
C&#947;&#8208;substituted proline derivatives are valuable tools for developing functionalized collagen peptides for biological and materials investigations, yet the stereochemistry at C&#947; can produce undesired steric or stereoelectronic constraints. Alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline (&#947;&#8208;azPro) derivatives are proline mimetics that lack a stereogenic center at the &#947;&#8208;position of the ring and can thus utilize the invertibility of nitrogen to adapt their conformation. NMR spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations highlighted how alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro derivatives are conformationally dynamic and adopt conformational preferences through ring pucker flip along with nitrogen inversion. Lastly, incorporation of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro into collagen peptides produced functionalized pH&#8208;responsive triple helices with similar thermal stabilities, regardless of their placement in the Xaa or Yaa position within the characteristic Xaa&#8208;Yaa&#8208;Gly repeating unit of collagen peptides.

Abstract
A facile approach to the synthesis of diaryl&#8208; and dialkyl&#8208;substituted monophosphino&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes by rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed phosphine&#8208;directed B3,6&#8722;H activation has been developed for the first time. Upon switching rhodium(I) to palladium(II), C&#8208;arylated and B6&#8208;halogenated products were obtained by using tBuOLi and Li2CO3 as base, respectively. These discoveries provide some simple and efficient approaches to the modification of monophosphino&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes.

      <title>A Maltol&#8208;Containing Ruthenium Polypyridyl Complex as a Potential Anticancer Agent
</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium versus platinum: The synthesis and characterisation of the potential chemotherapeutic agent [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) (DIP=4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline, mal=maltol) is described. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that the compound has higher activity than cisplatin. It is efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affects the mitochondrial metabolism.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Chemotherapy, despite its severe side effects, is to date one of the leading strategies against cancer. Metal&#8208;based drugs present several potential advantages when compared to organic compounds and they have gained trust from the scientific community after the approval on the market of the drug cisplatin. Recently, we reported the ruthenium complex ([Ru(DIP)2(sq)](PF6) (where DIP is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline and sq is semiquinonate) with a remarkable potential as chemotherapeutic agent against cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we analyse a structurally similar compound, namely [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), carrying the flavour&#8208;enhancing agent approved by the FDA, maltol (mal). To possess an FDA approved ligand is crucial for a complex, whose mechanism of action might include ligand exchange. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), its stability in solutions and under conditions that resemble the physiological ones, and its in&#8208;depth biological investigation. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines in 2D model and on HeLa MultiCellular Tumour Spheroids (MCTS) demonstrated that our compound has higher activity than cisplatin, inspiring further tests. [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) was efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affected the mitochondrial metabolism.

      <title>Multi&#8208;color fluorescent carbon dots: Non&#8208;size effect dominate graphitized sp2 conjugated domain and surface state energy level co&#8208;modulate band&#8208;gap</title>
      <dc:description>Four types of carbon dots with various color (blue, green, yellow and red) emissions have been synthesized under solvent&#8208;free condition from citric acid and different nitrogen sources (DMF, urea, ethanamide and formamide). By detailed characterization and comparion, it is comfimed that the graphitized sp2  conjugated domain and surface functional groups such as C&#8208;O and C=N play synergitic roles in adujusting fluorescence properties. Notable, the size effect is not the dominant mechanism to achieve multi&#8208;color fluorescence emissions in our work. The structural configuration of carbon dots further influences the energy band structure, as demonstrated in simplified energy level diagrams. An absorption peak ~560nm appears in visible light area for red&#8208;emitting f&#8208;CDs, assigned to n&#8594;&#960;* transition of aromatic structure, thus introducing a new surface state energy level, resulting in reducing the energy of electron transition and the expanding visible region in UV&#8208;vis spectrum. Taking advantage of diverse absorption and emission properties, different CDs/TiO2  binary composites are obtained for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes, and it is found that absorption range in visible light and the band&#8208;gap of carbon dots make a difference with the photocatalytic performance of the composites.</dc:description>

      <title>Yldiide Ligands as Building Blocks for Polynuclear Coinage Metal Complexes: Metal Squares, Triangles and Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Yldiides have unique electronic properties and donor abilities, but as ligands in transition metal complexes they are scarcely represented in the literature. Here, the controlled synthesis of a series of polynuclear gold yldiide complexes derived from triphenyl(cyanomethyl)phosphonium bromide, [Ph 3  PCH 2  CN]Br, under mild conditions is described. Anionic dinuclear NBu4  [(AuX) 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] (X = Cl, C 6  F 5  ) or trinuclear derivatives NBu 4  [Au 3  X 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] bearing terminal chloride or pentafluorophenyl groups and bridging yldiide ligands have been prepared. These compounds evolve in solution giving rise to the formation of an unprecedented tetrameric gold cluster, [Au 4  {C(CN)PPh 3  } 4  ], by the loss of the gold complex NBu 4  [AuX 2  ]. This gold cluster can also be prepared in high yield by a transmetallation reaction from the analogous tetrameric silver cluster, and two geometric isomers have been characterised, their formation dependent on the synthetic route. The  ligand has also been used to build different dinuclear and trinuclear cationic complexes bearing phosphine or diphosphine ancillary ligands and bridging yldiide moieties. Further coordination through the cyano group of the yldiide ligand gives heterometallic trinuclear or pentanuclear derivatives. Structural characterisation of many of these compounds reveals the presence of complex molecular systems stabilised by gold&#183;&#183;&#183;gold interactions and bridging yldiide ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly methyl methacrylate&#8208;assisted exfoliation of graphite and its use in acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites</title>
      <dc:description>One of the applications of graphene in which its scalable production is of utmost importance is the development of polymer composites. Among the techniques used to produce graphene flakes, the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite stands out due to its versatility and scalability. However, the solvents suitable for the LPE process are generally toxic and have a high boiling point, making the processing challenging. The use of low boiling point solvents could be convenient for the processing, due to the easiness of their removal.
In this study, we propose the use of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a stabilizing agent for the production of graphene flakes in a low boiling point solvent,  i.e.,  acetone. The graphene dispersions produced in the mixture acetone&#8208;PMMA increases the concentration by +175&#160;%, and contain a higher percentage of few&#8209;layer graphene flakes (&lt;&#160;5&#160;layers)  , e.g.,  +60&#160;%, compared to the dispersions prepared in acetone. The as&#8208;produced graphene dispersions are used to develop graphene/acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites. The mechanical properties of the pristine polymer are improved,  i.e  ., +&#160;22&#160;% in the Young&#8217;s modulus, by adding 0.01&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes. Moreover, a decrease of ~&#160;20&#160;% in the oxygen permeability is obtained using 0.1&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes filler, compared to the unloaded matrix.</dc:description>

The structural properties and DFT&#8208;D3 calculations of the new &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;like peptoids, as well as catalytic and spectroscopic studies on designed pyrrolidine&#8208;based helical peptoids, suggest that the &#946;&#8208;turn structure plays a key role in the stereoselectivity of the catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfonated Pyrene as a Photoregulator for Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Looping</title>
      <dc:description>
Loop&#8208;control system: The water&#8208;soluble sulfonated pyrene derivative SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator for the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). By observing the formation rate of the SPy dimer radical cation after photoionization, the looping kinetics of doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNA was revealed. Reducing the SPy dimer radical cation makes it possible to realize controlled unlooping.







Abstract
Controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules through photoregulators holds great promise as a spatiotemporally controllable tool for disease control. In addition, introducing photoregulators into biomolecules has also found applications in constructing smart nanomaterials. In spite of the astonishing advances that have been made in the past few years, realizing highly controllable and efficient regulation over the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions is still challenging. Herein, sulfonated pyrene SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator to control the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in aqueous solution. Due to its water solubility, SPy merits use in the study of biomolecules in aqueous solution. The looping of the doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNAs is stimulated by irradiation and regulated by SPy. Photoionization generates the radical cation of SPy (SPy.+). The association of SPy.+ with its neutral counterpart, SPy, gives rise to the dimer radical cation of SPy (SPy2.+). During the association process, the stabilization energy released to form SPy2.+ provides a driving force for the looping of ssDNAs. Conversely, the formed loop conformations were trapped by the formation of SPy2.+, and this allowed the looping dynamics to be investigated. The results reported herein suggest potential of SPy as a photoregulator for controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing with an Aptamer&#8208;Containing DNA Primer</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosensors: We demonstrate the ability to detect protein targets in solution and on paper&#8208;based sensors using a target&#8208;binding aptamer as a primer for rolling circle amplification (RCA). Binding of the target protein to the aptamer prevents the aptamer from binding a circular templet, inhibiting the initiation of the RCA process, which can be followed using a simple fluorescence assay (see figure).







Abstract
We report a method to detect proteins via suppression of rolling circle amplification (RCA) by using an appropriate aptamer as the linear primer (denoted as an aptaprimer) to initiate RCA. In the absence of a protein target, the aptaprimer is free to initiate RCA, which can produce long DNA products that are detected via binding of a fluorescent intercalating dye. Introduction of a target causes the primer region within the aptamer to become unavailable for binding to the circular template, inhibiting RCA. Using SYBR Gold or QuantiFluor dyes as fluorescent probes to bind to the RCA reaction product, it is possible to produce a generic protein&#8208;modulated RCA assay system that does not require fluorophore&#8208; or biotin&#8208;modified DNA species, substantially reducing complexity and cost of reagents. Based on this modulation of RCA, we demonstrate the ability to produce both solution and paper&#8208;based assays for rapid and quantitative detection of proteins including platelet derived growth factor and thrombin.

      <title>A Gold(I) Complex Containing an Oleanolic Acid Derivative as a Potential Anti&#8208;Ovarian&#8208;Cancer Agent by Inhibiting TrxR and Activating ROS&#8208;Mediated ERS
</title>
      <dc:description>
Au versus OC: A gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer (OC) cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzyme activity to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediates ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, it inhibits xenograft OC tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.







Abstract
Many cancer cells critically rely on antioxidant systems for cell survival and are vulnerable to further oxidative impairment triggered by agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the classical design and development of inhibitors that target antioxidant defense enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) can be a promising anticancer strategy. Herein, it is shown that a gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative (4&#8201;b) induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer A2780 cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It can inhibit TrxR enzyme activity to elevate ROS, mediate ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, this complex inhibits A2780 xenograft tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.

      <title>Solid&#8208;State Dynamics and High&#8208;Pressure Studies of a Supramolecular Spiral Gear</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular gears: The solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature and pressure by a combination of non&#8208;ambient XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The structures and solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the general formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (where DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature (from 100 to 360&#8197;K) and pressure (up to 3.4&#8197;GPa), through the combination of variable&#8208;temperature and variable&#8208;pressure XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The two salts are isomorphous and crystallize in the enantiomeric space groups P3221 and P3121. All building blocks composing the supramolecular complex display dynamic processes at ambient temperature and pressure. It has been demonstrated that the motion of the crown ethers is maintained on lowering the temperature (down to 100&#8197;K) or on increasing the pressure (up to 1.5&#8197;GPa) thanks to the correlation between neighboring molecules, which mesh and rotate in a concerted manner similar to spiral gears. Above 1.55&#8197;GPa, a collapse&#8208;type transition to a lower&#8208;symmetry ordered structure, not attainable at a temperature of 100&#8197;K, takes place, proving, thus, that the pressure acts as the means to couple and decouple the gears. The relationship between temperature and pressure effects on molecular motion in the solid state has also been discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The structures and solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the general formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;DABCOH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](X)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) have been investigated as a function of temperature (from 100 to 360&#8197;K) and pressure (up to 3.4&#8197;GPa), through the combination of variable&#8208;temperature and variable&#8208;pressure XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The two salts are isomorphous and crystallize in the enantiomeric space groups &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. All building blocks composing the supramolecular complex display dynamic processes at ambient temperature and pressure. It has been demonstrated that the motion of the crown ethers is maintained on lowering the temperature (down to 100&#8197;K) or on increasing the pressure (up to 1.5&#8197;GPa) thanks to the correlation between neighboring molecules, which mesh and rotate in a concerted manner similar to spiral gears. Above 1.55&#8197;GPa, a collapse&#8208;type transition to a lower&#8208;symmetry ordered structure, not attainable at a temperature of 100&#8197;K, takes place, proving, thus, that the pressure acts as the means to couple and decouple the gears. The relationship between temperature and pressure effects on molecular motion in the solid state has also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards the Sarpagine&#8208;Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Family of Indole Alkaloids: Enantioselective Synthesis of an N&#8208;Demethyl Alstolactone Diastereomer</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic methods: Transannular cyclization is a key step for the formation of azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a common structural motif found in the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of natural products (see scheme).







Abstract
the strategy involving the use of functionalized tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;cycloocta[b]indol&#8208;6&#8208;one is reported as a key intermediate for synthesis of members of the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The desired tricycle was synthesized through the following key steps: 1)&#8197;Evans&#8217; syn&#8208;selective aldolization; 2)&#8197;Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl cross&#8208;coupling using the phenylthiol ester of 3&#8208;chloropropanoic acid as a surrogate of acrylic thioester for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles; and 3)&#8197;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) for the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring. An N&#8208;allylation followed by intramolecular 1,4&#8208;addition was planned for synthesis of the vobasine class of natural products. However, attempted cyclizations under a diverse set of conditions involving anionic, radical, and organopalladium/organonickel species failed to produce the bridged ring system. On the other hand, esterification of the pendant primary alcohol function with acetoacetic acid, followed by intramolecular Michael addition, afforded the desired tetracycle with excellent diastereoselectivity. Subsequent functional group manipulation and transannular cyclization of the amino alcohol afforded the N(1)&#8208;demethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;alstolactone. We believe that the same synthetic route would afford the alstolactone should the amino alcohol with appropriate stereochemistry be used as the starting material.

      <title>Defluoroalkylation of sp3 C&#8722;F Bonds of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it simple! A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones (see scheme).







Abstract
A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones. The reaction sequence allows construction of a new C&#8722;C bond in a highly selective manner from a single sp3 C&#8722;F bond of a CF3 group in the presence of sp2 C&#8722;F bonds. The scope incorporates industrially relevant fluorocarbons including HFO&#8208;1234yf and HFO&#8208;1234ze. No catalyst, additives or transition metals are required, rather the methodology relies on a recently developed boron reagent. Remarkably, the boron site of this reagent plays a dual role in the reaction sequence, being nucleophilic at boron in the C&#8722;F cleavage step (SN2&#8217;) but electrophilic at boron en route to the carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming step (SE2&#8217;). The duplicitous behaviour is underpinned by a hydrogen atom migration from boron to the carbon atom of a carbene ligand.

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the barrel: The formation of H&#8208;aggregates for an 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI)&#8208;containing organogelator enhances the fluorescence quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, a new record for HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system.







Abstract
To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI), in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f=2.9 vs. 0.02&#8201;%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Structural Elucidation of Silver(I) Amides and Their Application as Catalysts in the Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Carbonyls</title>
      <dc:description>
The allure of silver: Utilizing monomeric silver(I) amides as molecular defined pre&#8208;catalysts, the first silver&#8208;mediated hydroboration of a range of aldehydes and ketones has been achieved. Catalytic hydrosilylation of carbonyls has also shown success employing Ph2SiH2. Both mechanisms are proposed to proceed via a &#8216;AgH&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
This study details the isolation and characterisation of three novel silver(I) amides in solution and solid&#8208;state, [Ag(Cy3P)(HMDS)] 2, [Ag(Cy3P){N(TMS)(Dipp)}] 3 and [Ag(Cy3P)2(NPh2)] 4. Their catalytic abilities have proved successful in hydroboration and hydrosilylation reactions with a full investigation performed with complex&#8197;2. Both protocols proceed under mild conditions, displaying exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance and chemoselectivity, in excellent conversions at competitive reaction times. This work reveals the first catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones performed by a silver(I) catalyst.

      <title>Highly Polarized Coumarin Derivatives Revisited: Solvent&#8208;controlled Competition Between Proton Coupled Electron Transfer and Twisted Intramolecular Electron Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Linking a polarized coumarin unit with an aromatic substituent via an amide bridge results in weak electronic coupling affecting the intramolecular electron transfer (ET) process. As a result of this, interesting solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical properties can be observed. In polar solvents, electron transfer in coumarin derivatives of this type induces a mutual twist of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting molecular units (TICT process) that opens radiationless decay processes (internal conversion). In the dyad with the strongest intramolecular hydrogen bond, the planar form is stabilized so twisting can only occur in highly polar solvents, whereas fast proton coupled electron transfer (PCET process) occurs in non&#8208;polar n&#8208;alkanes. The kPCET rate constant decreases linearly with the fluorescence maximum energy in different solvents. This observation is explained in terms of competition between electron and proton transfer from a highly polarized (~15 D) and fluorescent locally&#8208;excited (1LE) state to a much less polarized (~4 D) charge&#8208;transfer (1CT) state, a unique occurrence. Photophysical measurements performed for a family of related coumarin dyads together with results of quantum&#8208;chemical computations give insight into the mechanism of the ET process which is followed by either a TICT or PCET process. Our results reveal that dielectric solvation of the excited state slows down the PCET process, even in non&#8208;polar solvents.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Divergent Catalysis Using a Bench&#8208;Stable Cobalt(I) Hydride Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Night and day: A rare example of switching product outcome depending on light&#8208;dark is reported. Using a cobalt(I) hydride complex, hydroborated products are obtained under visible&#8208;light irradiation whereas, in contrast, alkene isomerisation occurs in the dark. This dual&#8208;function catalysis results from alteration of the coordination sphere surrounding the metal centre.







Abstract
While the use of visible light in conjunction with transition metal catalysis offers powerful opportunities to switch between on/&#8208;off states of catalytic activity, the next frontier would be the ability to switch the actual function of the catalyst and resulting products. Here we report such an example of multi&#8208;dimensional catalysis. Featuring an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable cobalt(I) hydride complex in conjunction with pinacolborane, we can switch the reaction outcome between two widely employed transformations, olefin migration and hydroboration, with visible light as the trigger.

      <title>Room Temperature Coupling of Aryldiazoacetates with Boronic Acids Enhanced by Blue Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Lights on! A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Mechanistic studies including control experiments, DFT calculations and reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring; as well as synthetic applications have been performed showcasing a rich panorama of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photochemical protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Except for a few cases, the room temperature coupling in the dark (thermal process) generally does not work. When it does, it is likely to also involve free carbenes as key intermediates. Alternatively, photochemical reactions show a broad scope, can be performed under air and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups. Reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring, DFT calculations and control experiments have been used to evaluate the main aspects of this intricate mechanistic scenario. Biologically active molecules Adiphenine, Benactyzine and Aprophen have been prepared as examples of synthetic applications.

      <title>Efficient Fused Ring Extension of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type Nonfullerene Acceptors via Symmetric Replicating Core Unit Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Extension of a fused aromatic ring core is beneficial for enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer and effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation in A&#8208;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). In this work, a novel strategy involving extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetrically replicating core unit was developed, and a novel symmetric fused&#8208;12&#8208;ring NFA, LC81 was synthesized. When paired with the wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PBT1&#8208;C, the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs) showed a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.71%, much higher than that of the device based on reference NFA, TPTT&#8208;4F. Moreover, the LC81&#8208;based OSC displayed a lower energy loss and a better ambient stability than the TPTT&#8208;4F&#8208;based device. Our results indicate that the extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetric replicating core unit is an effective strategy for promoting photovoltaic characteristics of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The increasing demand of high&#8208;performance crystalline oxide nanomaterials for applications in current and emergent technologies is pushing research on alternative and sustainable synthesis processes, ideally complying with the principles of Green Chemistry. In this framework, wet&#8208;chemistry approaches are particularly promising, since they are typically based on soft synthesis processes, in terms of temperature and pressure, or use water and/or non&#8208;toxic alcohols as solvents. Solution methods are low&#8208;cost and simple approaches to the synthesis of nanomaterials but, to achieve sustainable, environmentally friendly and competitive manufacturing, they should address an additional target, i.e.  the reduction of process energy consumption. This is one of the paradigms of Green Chemistry, where low temperatures and mild conditions of synthesis are specifically pursued. Using low temperatures for the preparation of a nanomaterial or of a nanostructured thin film does not necessarily imply sacrificing crystallinity and compositional purity of the obtained sample. Indeed, low temperatures actually afford tighter control on size and size distribution of the obtained nanostructures and of the microstructure and heterostructure of the resulting films.

In this context, the present progress report provides a brief overview of low&#8208;temperature solution methods reported in the literature to attain crystalline oxide nanostructures and thin films.

      <title>Hydroboration of alkenes catalysed by a nickel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex: reaction and mechanistic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The pentamethylcyclopentadienyl N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel complex [Ni(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Cl(IMes)] (IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) efficiently catalyses the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes with catecholborane in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide, and joins the very exclusive club of nickel catalysts for this important transformation. Interestingly, the regioselectivity can be reversed in some cases by using pinacolborane instead of catecholborane. Mechanistic investigations involving control experiments,  1  H and  11  B NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, piezometric measurements and DFT calculations suggest an initial reduction of the Ni(II) precursor to a Ni(I) active species with the concomitant release of H  2  . The crucial role of the alkoxo&#8208;catecholato&#8208;borohydride species resulting from the reaction of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide with catecholborane in the formation of an intermediate nickel&#8208;hydride species that would then be reduced a Ni(I) active species, is highlighted.</dc:description>

The crucial role of the alkoxo&#8208;catecholato&#8208;borohydride species resulting from the reaction of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide with catecholborane in the formation of an intermediate nickel&#8208;hydride species that would then be reduced a Ni(I) active species, is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Manipulation of the Coordination Geometry along the C4 Rotation Axis in a Dinuclear Tb3+ Triple&#8208;Decker Complex via a Supramolecular Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Switchable SMMs: The magnetic relaxation behavior of a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) could be controlled by selectively changing the coordination environment in the neutral state using a supramolecular approach. By controlling the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 axis in the Tb&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes, switchable SMMs are possible.







Abstract
A supramolecular complex (1&#8901;C60) was prepared by assembling (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) with the dinuclear Tb3+ triple&#8208;decker complex [(TPP)Tb(Pc)Tb(TPP)] (1: Tb3+=trivalent terbium ion, Pc2&#8722;=phthalocyaninato, TPP2&#8722;=tetraphenylporphyrinato) with quasi&#8208;D4h symmetry to investigate the relationship between the coordination symmetry and single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) properties. Tb3+&#8208;Pc triple&#8208;decker complexes (Tb2Pc3) have an important advantage over Tb3+&#8208;Pc double&#8208;decker complexes (TbPc2) since the magnetic relaxation processes correspond to the Zeeman splitting when there are two 4f spin systems. The two Tb3+ sites of 1 are equivalent, and the twist angle (&#966;) was determined to be 3.62&#176;. On the other hand, the two Tb3+ sites of 1&#8901;C60 are not equivalent. The &#966; values for sites Tb1 and Tb2 were determined to be 3.67&#176; and 33.8&#176;, respectively, due to a change in the coordination symmetry of 1 upon association with C60. At 1.8&#8197;K, 1 and 1&#8901;C60 undergo different magnetic relaxations, and the changes in the ground state affect the spin dynamics. Although 1 and 1&#8901;C60 relax via QTM in a zero applied magnetic field (H), H dependencies of the magnetic relaxation times (&#964;) for H&gt;1500&#8197;Oe are similar. On the other hand, for H&lt;1500&#8197;Oe, the &#964; values have different behaviors since the off&#8208;diagonal terms (
) affect the magnetic relaxation mechanism. From temperature (T) and H dependences of &#964;, spin&#8208;phonon interactions along with direct and Raman mechanisms explain the spin dynamics. We believe that a supramolecular method can be used to control the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 rotation axis and the spin dynamic properties in dinuclear Ln3+&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes.

      <title>Boosting visible&#8208;light photocatalytic redox reaction by charge separation in SnO2/ZnSe(N2H4)0.5 heterojunction nanocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report environmental photocatalysts with attractive catalytic properties prepared by introducing SnO  2  quantum dots (QDs) directly attached onto ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  substrates to induce advantageous charge separation. The SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  nanocomposites could be easily synthesized  via  a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal process.

Moreover, the addition of a specified amount of SnO  2  boosted the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity; however, the presence of excess SnO  2  QDs in the substrate resulted in aggregation and deteriorated the performance. The spectroscopic data revealed that the SnO  2  QDs act as a photocatalytic mediator and enhance the charge separation within the type&#8208;II band alignment system of the SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  heterojunction photocatalysts.

      <title>Collective Effects of Electron Affinity and Steric Hindrance of Trifluoromethyl on the &#960;&#8208;Bridge in Designing Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>To explore the correlation of the electron affinity of acceptor and the molecular conformation to the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) feature, a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules were designed and synthesized with triazine (Trz) as acceptor (A) and carbazole (Cz) or tert&#8208;butylcarbazole (BuCz) as donor (D). On the phenylene bridge between D and A, methyl or trifluoromethyl was incorporated close either to D or to A to tune the molecular conformation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor. Both the twist angles and the singlet and triplet energy difference (&#916;  E  ST  ) were observed strongly dependent on the type and position of the substituent on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. Only those molecules with trifluoromethyl locating close to the D side, namely TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  , exhibit TADF feature, verifying that both sufficient electron affinity of the A unit and large dihedral angle between D and the &#960;&#8208;bridge are necessary to ensure the occurance of TADF. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  achieved external quantum efficiencies of 9.40% and 14.22% with CIE coordinates of (0.19, 0.23) and (0.18, 0.29) respectively. This study provides practical design strategy for blue TADF materials particularly when planar and less crowded group is used as donor.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To explore the correlation of the electron affinity of acceptor and the molecular conformation to the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) feature, a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules were designed and synthesized with triazine (Trz) as acceptor (A) and carbazole (Cz) or tert&#8208;butylcarbazole (BuCz) as donor (D). On the phenylene bridge between D and A, methyl or trifluoromethyl was incorporated close either to D or to A to tune the molecular conformation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor. Both the twist angles and the singlet and triplet energy difference (&#916;  E  ST  ) were observed strongly dependent on the type and position of the substituent on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. Only those molecules with trifluoromethyl locating close to the D side, namely TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  , exhibit TADF feature, verifying that both sufficient electron affinity of the A unit and large dihedral angle between D and the &#960;&#8208;bridge are necessary to ensure the occurance of TADF. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  achieved external quantum efficiencies of 9.40% and 14.22% with CIE coordinates of (0.19, 0.23) and (0.18, 0.29) respectively. This study provides practical design strategy for blue TADF materials particularly when planar and less crowded group is used as donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The CH&#8208;&#960; interaction in protein &#8211; carbohydrate binding: Bioinformatics and in vitro quantification</title>
      <dc:description>The molecular recognition of carbohydrates by proteins plays a key role in many biological processes including immune response, pathogen entry into a cell and cell&#8208;cell adhesion (e.g., in cancer metastasis). Carbohydrates interact with proteins mainly through hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated interaction and non&#8208;polar dispersion interactions. The role of dispersion&#8208;driven CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (stacking) in protein&#8208;carbohydrate recognition has been underestimated for a long time considering&#160;&#160;the polar interactions to be the main forces for saccharide interactions.&#160;&#160;However, over the last few years it turns out that non&#8208;polar interactions are equally important. In this study we analyzed the CH&#8208;&#960; interactions employing bioinformatics (data mining, structural analysis), several experimental (ITC, X&#8208;ray crystallography) and computational techniques. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been used as a source of structural data.

Unusual spin&#8208;crossover features of [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]+: The series of compounds [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=a halogen substituent) exhibit 50&#8201;% spin crossover with a broad [HS&#8208;LS] plateau, a magnetic profile hitherto not crystallographically elucidated within the FeIII&#8208;salRen family (R=alkyl group).

Abstract
X&#8208;ray structures of the halo&#8208;substituted complexes [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) [salMeen=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)salicylaldiminate]at RT have revealed the presence of two discrete HS complex cations in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with two perchlorate counter ions linking them by N&#8722;Hamine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Operchlorate interactions. At 90&#8197;K, the two complex cations are distinctly HS and LS, a rare crystallographic observation of this coexistence in the FeIII&#8208;salRen (R=alkyl) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) system. At both temperatures, crystal packing shows dimerization through C&#8722;Himine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ophenolate interactions, a key feature for SCO cooperativity. Moreover, there are noncovalent contacts between the complex cations through type&#8208;II halogen&#8208;halogen bonds, which are novel in this system. The magnetic profiles and M&#246;ssbauer spectra concur with the structural analyses and reveal 50&#8201;% SCO of the type [HS&#8208;HS]&#8596;[HS&#8208;LS] with a broad plateau. In contrast, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]BPh4&#8901;2MeOH is LS and exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition, exemplifying the influence of lattice solvents and counter ions on SCO.

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Olefination of Sterically Demanding Benzamides: Application to the Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzamides</title>
      <dc:description>
An unsubstituted CpRhIII complex is a highly effective catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral benzamides (see scheme).







Abstract
It has been established that an unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRhIII) complex is a highly active catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of sterically demanding ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. This catalysis was successfully applied to the diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamides. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamide derivatives with high ee values.

      <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid catalyzed protocol has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted furan and thiophene derivatives from enaminones and enaminothiones. The [4+1] annulation allows for broad substrate scopes, high efficiency, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.







Abstract
Concise construction of furan and thiophene units has played an important role in the synthesis of potentially bioactive compounds and functional materials. Herein, an efficient Lewis acid ZnCl2 catalyzed [4+1] annulation of alkylthio&#8208;substituted enaminones is reported, that is, &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals with sulfur ylides to afford 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;aminofuran derivatives. In a similar fashion, [4+1] annulation of the corresponding enaminothiones, that is, &#945;&#8208;thioxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals, with sulfur ylides efficiently proceeded to give multisubstituted 3&#8208;aminothiophenes. This method features wide substrate scopes as well as broad functional group tolerance, offering a concise route to highly functionalized furans and thiophenes.

      <title>Molecular Engineering of Isomeric Benzofurocarbazole Donors for Photophysical Management of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning delayed fluorescence: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.







Abstract
Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, only 5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (34BFCz) has been reported and, to the best of our knowledge, no other benzofurocarbazole derivatives have been covered in the literature. In the present study, two further benzofurocarbazole moieties, 12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (12BFCz) and 7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (23BFCz), have been synthesized to investigate the effect of the donor structure on the photophysics and device parameters of TADF emitters. Two benzofurocarbazole&#8208;derived TADF emitters, 12&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (o12BFCzTrz) and 7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (o23BFCzTrz), have been compared with 5&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (oBFCzTrz). The benzofurocarbazole donor structure governs the TADF characteristics, such as charge&#8208;transfer property and emission color. The 12BFCz donor has proved to be effective in blue&#8208;shifting the emission color, and 34BFCz has proven useful for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The 12BFCz&#8208;derived o12BFCzTrz showed blue&#8208;shifted color coordinates of (0.159, 0.288), compared to (0.178, 0388) for o23BFCzTrz and (0.169, 0.341) for oBFCzTrz. The 34BFCz&#8208;derived oBFCzTrz exhibited an EQE of 22.9&#8201;%, compared to 19.2&#8201;% for o12BFCzTrz and 21.1&#8201;% for o23BFCzTrz.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuning delayed fluorescence&lt;/b&gt;: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.

Abstract
In pursuit of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities, porous LiFe0.4Mn0.6PO4/CNF free&#8208;standing electrodes have been successfully prepared through a facile ionic liquid (IL) assisted electrospinning method. Owing to the hierarchical porosity and N&#8208;doped carbon layer derived from the ionic liquid, the resulting electrodes exhibited superior electrochemical performances with an improvement of conductivity and pseudocapacitive contribution, delivering a discharge capability of 162.7, 133.5, 114.5, and 102.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current rates of 0.1, 1, 5, and 10&#8197;C, respectively. It is highly expected that this facile IL&#8208;assisted electrospinning method will lead to further developments for other phosphate&#8208;based free&#8208;standing electrodes, which offers a new route in designing polyanionic cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Metallacarboranes as Photoredox Catalysts in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst and photosensitizer: Cobaltabisdicarbollide [3,3&#8217;&#8208;Co(1,2&#8208;C2B9H11)2]&#8722; and its chloro derivatives are both efficient catalysts and photosensitizers for the photooxidation of alcohols in water through single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. This behavior is due to their high solubility in water, lack of photoluminescence, easy modification of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and high oxidizing power for the Co4+/3+ couple, among others. High performance is achieved with a catalyst loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metallacarboranes with the shape of the Greek letter &#952;, such as [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;, were tested, for the first time, as efficient photoredox catalysts in the oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols in water. Their efficiency is linked to their high solubility in water, their high oxidizing power (Co4+/3+), and their absence of fluorescence on excitation, among others. In most of the studied examples, using a catalyst load of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;% gave high yields of 90&#8211;95&#8201;% with selectivity greater than 99&#8201;%. By reducing the catalyst load to 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, quantitative conversion of reactants to products was achieved, in some cases with greater than 99&#8201;% yield, high catalyst efficiency reaching a turnover number of 10&#8201;000, and a higher yield with a 45 times lower concentration of catalyst. The metallacarboranes can be recovered easily by precipitation on addition of [NMe4]Cl. A pathway for the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of alcohols is proposed.

      <title>Evidence for Genuine Bimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Activation of Dihydrogen with Gold(I)/Platinum(0) Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Balance of power: A family of AuI/Pt0 systems activate H2 by a genuine frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, as demonstrated by a joint experimental/computational effort. These studies evinced that balancing the degree of frustration versus M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction has a strong impact on activation capacity, whereas subtle modifications on ligand sterics result in drastic changes in activity and product distribution.







Abstract
A joint experimental/computational effort to elucidate the mechanism of dihydrogen activation by a gold(I)/platinum(0) metal&#8208;only frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) is described herein. The drastic effects on H2 activation derived from subtle ligand modifications have also been investigated. The importance of the balance between bimetallic adduct formation and complete frustration has been interrogated, providing for the first time evidence for genuine metal&#8208;only FLP reactivity in solution. The origin of a strong inverse kinetic isotopic effect has also been clarified, offering further support for the proposed bimetallic FLP&#8208;type cleavage of dihydrogen.

      <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal Complexes in Selective Bond Formations Through Radical Pathways</title>

Mainly main group: Remarkable progress has been made in the synthesis and investigation of main&#8208;group metal complexes for radical reactions. This contribution highlights applications of such compounds for selective bond forming events in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions through radical pathways.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in radical reactions involving main&#8208;group metal complexes. This includes the isolation and detailed characterization of main&#8208;group metal radical compounds, but also the generation of highly reactive persistent or transient radical species. A rich arsenal of methods has been established that allows control over and exploitation of their unusual reactivity patterns. Thus, main&#8208;group metal compounds have entered the field of selective bond formations in controlled radical reactions. Transformations that used to be the domain of late transition&#8208;metal compounds have been realized, and unusual selectivities, high activities, as well as remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerances have been reported. Recent findings demonstrate the potential of main&#8208;group metal compounds to become standard tools of synthetic chemistry, catalysis, and materials science, when operating through radical pathways.

      <title>Boron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes: A Synthetic Tale from Borazine Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanographene doping: The preparation of borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines led to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation. A new boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery was isolated. Mechanistic studies on the reaction and evaluation of the doping effect on the optoelectronic properties are also reported.







Abstract
In this work, a comprehensive account of the authors&#8217; synthetic efforts to prepare borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines, bearing an ortho fluoride leaving group on each of the N&#8208; and B&#8208;aryl rings, was shown to lead to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation, giving higher yields of borazinocoronenes than those obtained with borazine precursors bearing fluoride leaving groups at the ortho positions of the B&#8208;aryl substituents. By using this pathway, an unprecedented boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery could be isolated, and its structure proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Mechanistic studies on the stepwise Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization suggest that the mechanism of the planarization reaction proceeds through extension of the &#960; system. To appraise the doping effect of the boroxadizine unit on the optoelectronic properties of topology&#8208;equivalent molecular graphenes, the all&#8208;carbon and pyrylium PAH analogues, all featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery, were also prepared. As already shown for the borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronene, the replacement of the central benzene ring by its B3N2O congener widens the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and dramatically enhances the fluorescence quantum yield.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Substitution of Aliphatic Alcohols Mediated by Sulfuryl Fluoride</title>
      <dc:description>
A method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is described. This new process is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using N, S, O, and C nucleophiles. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable, which was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification (see scheme).







Abstract
The Mitsunobu reaction is a powerful transformation for the one&#8208;pot activation and substitution of aliphatic alcohols. Significant efforts have focused on modifying the classic conditions to overcome problems associated with purification from phosphine&#8208;based byproducts. Herein, we report a phosphine free method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride. This new method is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using phthalimide, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;iminodicarboxylate, and aromatic thiol nucleophiles in 74&#8201;% average yield. Activated carbon nucleophiles and a deactivated phenol were also effective for this reaction in good yields. Secondary alcohols were also successful substrates using aryl thiols, affording the corresponding sulfides in 56&#8201;% average yield with enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable. This feature was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions enabled further in situ derivatization for the one&#8208;pot conversion of alcohols to amines or sulfones. This method also provides a boarder nucleophile scope compared to existing phosphine&#8208;free methods.

      <title>Efficient Screening for Ternary Molecular Ionic Cocrystals Using a Complementary Mechanosynthesis and Computational Structure Prediction Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot on predictions! The mechanosynthesis of ternary molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) with significantly different physicochemical properties has been achieved in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding. The crystal structures of the ICCs were successfully predicted by using computational methods. The results pave the way for the efficient screening of higher&#8208;order multicomponent crystal forms with functional properties (see figure).







Abstract
The discovery of molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) widens the opportunities for optimizing the physicochemical properties of APIs whilst facilitating the delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. However, ICCs are often observed serendipitously in crystallization screens and the factors dictating their crystallization are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that mechanochemical ball milling is a versatile technique for the reproducible synthesis of ternary molecular ICCs in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding with or without solvent. Computational crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations have been performed on ternary molecular ICCs for the first time and the observed crystal structures of all the ICCs were correctly predicted. Periodic dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that all the ICCs are thermodynamically stable (mean stabilization energy=&#8722;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) relative to the crystallization of a physical mixture of the binary salt and acid. The results suggest that a combined mechanosynthesis and CSP approach could be used to target the synthesis of higher&#8208;order molecular ICCs with functional properties.

      <title>Catalytic Platinum Nanoparticles Decorated with Subnanometer Molybdenum Clusters for Biomass Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
Development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals requires efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. This article demonstrates that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound.







Abstract
The development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals is hindered due to a lack of efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. Here we report that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters can efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound. In contrast with monometallic Mo catalysts that are inactive and monometallic Pt catalysts that have low activities and selectivities, bimetallic Pt&#8211;Mo catalysts exhibit synergistic effects with high activities and selectivities. The maximum activity occurs at a Pt to Mo molar ratio of three. Although Mo atoms themselves are catalytically inactive, they serve as preferential binding anchors for oxygen atoms while a catalytic transformation proceeds on neighboring surface Pt atoms. Beyond biomass processing, Pt&#8211;Mo nanoparticles are promising catalysts for a wide variety of reactions that require a transformation of molecules with an oxygen atom and, more broadly, in other fields of science and technology that require tuning of surface&#8211;oxygen interactions.

      <title>Active Metal Template Synthesis and Characterization of a Nanohoop [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
      <dc:description>Molecules and materials that demonstrate large amplitude responses to minor changes in their local environment play an important role in the development of new forms of nanotechnology. Molecular daisy chains are a type of a mechanically interlocked molecule that are particularly sensitive to such changes where, in the presence of certain stimuli, the molecular linkage enables muscle&#8208;like movement between a reduced&#8208;length contracted form and an increased&#8208;length expanded form.&#160; To date, all reported syntheses of molecular daisy chains are accomplished via passive&#8208;template methods, resulting in a majority of structures being switchable only through the addition of an exogenous stimuli such as metal ions or changes in pH.&#160; Here, we describe a new approach to these structural motifs that exploits a multi&#8208;component active&#8208;metal template synthesis to mechanically interlock two pi&#8208;rich nanohoop macrocycles into a molecular daisy chain which undergoes large conformational changes via thermal energy.</dc:description>

Molecular daisy chains are a type of a mechanically interlocked molecule that are particularly sensitive to such changes where, in the presence of certain stimuli, the molecular linkage enables muscle&#8208;like movement between a reduced&#8208;length contracted form and an increased&#8208;length expanded form.&#160; To date, all reported syntheses of molecular daisy chains are accomplished via passive&#8208;template methods, resulting in a majority of structures being switchable only through the addition of an exogenous stimuli such as metal ions or changes in pH.&#160; Here, we describe a new approach to these structural motifs that exploits a multi&#8208;component active&#8208;metal template synthesis to mechanically interlock two pi&#8208;rich nanohoop macrocycles into a molecular daisy chain which undergoes large conformational changes via thermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Extracellular matrix proteins involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and characterized by cognitive and memory impairments. Emerging evidence suggests that the extracellular matrix (ECM) biomacromolecules in brain plays an important role in etiology of AD. It has been detected that the levels of ECM proteins have been changed in the brains of AD patients and animal models. Some ECM components, e.g., elastin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are considered to promote the upregulation of extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) proteins. In addition, collagen VI and laminin are shown to have interactions with A&#946; peptides, which might lead to clearance of those peptides. Thus, ECM proteins are involved in both amyloidosis and neuroprotection in AD process. However, the molecular mechanism of neuronal ECM proteins on pathophysiology of AD remains elusive. More investigation of ECM proteins with AD pathogenesis is needed, and this may lead to novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for AD.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Diphenanthrioctaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0), an expanded carbaporphyrinoid incorporating two phenanthrenylene moieties, exists as two separate, yet interconvertible, locked stereoisomers.

      <title>Hetero Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with a Dicationic Urea Azine Derived Azo Dienophile and Their Use for the Synthesis of an Electron&#8208;Rich Pentacene</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the first hetero Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions with a stable, dicationic urea azine derived azo dienophile, synthesised by two&#8208;electron oxidation of the neutral urea azine. Several charged DA products were synthesised in good yield and fully characterised. The DA adduct of anthracene is in thermal equilibrium with the reactants at room temperature, and the reaction enthalpy and entropy were determined from the temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium constant. Furthermore, base addition to solutions of the pentacene DA product leads to deprotonation, cleavage of the N&#8208;N bond and formation of an electron&#8208;rich 6,13&#8208;bisguanidinyl&#8208;substituted pentacene. The redox and optical properties of this new pentacene derivative were studied. Furthermore, the dication resulting from its two&#8208;electron oxidation was synthesised and fully characterised. The results disclose a novel elegant route to electron&#8208;rich pentacene derivatives.</dc:description>

The highly unusual release of the&#160; tert &#8208;butoxide ligand as &#160;t BuOH in the course of the reaction was observed. The formed alkylidene complexes and&#160;tBuOH are in an equilibrium with the NHC and the dialkyl complexes. Reaction kinetics were monitored by&#160;1H NMR.

      <title>Playing with PtII and ZnII Coordination to Obtain Luminescent Metallomesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature mesomorphism was obtained for PtII and ZnII coordination complexes by playing with the coordination ability of a lipophilic gallate unit. The delicate balance between induction of mesomorphism and luminescence in condensed states is discussed (see figure).







Abstract
Blue&#8211;green luminescent terpyridine&#8208;containing PtII and ZnII complexes are reported. Equipped with lipophilic gallate units, which act as monodentate ancillary coordinating ligands and/or as anions, they display low&#8208;temperature mesomorphic properties (lamello&#8208;columnar and hexagonal mesophases for PtII and ZnII complexes, respectively). The mesomorphic properties were investigated by polarised optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X&#8208;ray scattering of bulk materials and oriented thin films. The model of self&#8208;assembly into the lamello&#8208;columnar phase of the PtII complex has been described in detail. The optical properties of the complexes were investigated in the liquid and condensed liquid crystalline states, highlighting the delicate balance between the role of the metal in determining the type of excited state responsible for the emission, and the role of the ancillary ligand in driving intermolecular interactions for proper mesophase formation.

      <title>Compressing a Non&#8208;Planar Aromatic Heterocyclic [7]Helicene to a Planar Hetero[8]Circulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting compressed: Non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core.







Abstract
This work describes a synthetic approach where a non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core. This [8]circulene consists of four benzene rings and four heterocyclic rings, and it is the first heterocyclic [8]circulene containing three different heteroatoms. The synthetic pathway proceeds via a the flattened dehydro&#8208;hetero[7]helicene, which is partially a helicene and partially a circulene: it is non&#8208;planar and helically chiral as helicenes, and contains a COT motif like [8]circulenes. The antiaromaticity of the COT core is confirmed by nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. The planarization from a helically &#960;&#8208;conjugated [7]helicene to a fully planar heterocyclic [8]circulene significantly alters the spectroscopic properties of the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalization of the [7]helicenes and the [8]circulenes by oxygenation of the thiophene rings to the corresponding thiophene&#8208;sulfones allows an almost complete fluorescence emission coverage of the visible region of the optical spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal alkyne hydroboration with cage B&#8722;H of o&#8208;carborane has been achieved, leading to the controlled synthesis of a series of 3,6&#8208;[trans&#8208;(AlkCH=CH)]2&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (Alk=alkyl), 3&#8208;cis&#8208;(ArCH=CH)&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (Ar=aryl), and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;(ArCH=CH)&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;(AlkCH=CH)&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and very good cis&#8211;trans selectivity. The most electron&#8208;deficient B(3,6)&#8722;H vertices favor oxidative addition on electron&#8208;rich metal centers, which is responsible for the regioselectivity. On the other hand, the configuration of the resultant olefinic units is dominated by alkyne substituents. Alkyl groups lead to a trans&#8208;configuration whereas bulky aryl substitutions result in cis&#8208;configuration.

      <dc:description>
Solid construction: A 3D asymmetric supercapacitor system constructed from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and nanospinous Fe2O3 on hollow melamine foam/polypyrrole (MF/PPY) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, is reported. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an extended operation voltage window and good cycling stability (see figure).







Abstract
Supercapacitors have attracted tremendous research interest, since they are expected to achieve battery&#8208;level energy density, while having a long calendar life and short charging time. Herein, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor has been successfully assembled from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and spinous Fe2O3 nanowire modified hollow melamine foam decorated with polypyrrole as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Owing to the well&#8208;designed nanostructure and suitable matching of electrode materials, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibits an extended operation voltage window of 1.6&#8197;V with an energy density of 20.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 159.4&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the ASC shows stable cycling stability, with 81.3&#8201;% retention after 4000&#8197;cycles and a low internal resistance of 1.03&#8197;&#937;. Additionally, a 2.5&#8197;V light&#8208;emitting diode indicator can be lit up by three ASCs connected in series; this provides evidence of the practical application potential of the assembled energy&#8208;storage system. The excellent electrochemical performances should be credited to the significant enhancement of the specific surface area, charge transport, and mechanical stability resulting from the unique 3D morphology.

      <title>A Path to More Sustainable Catalysis: The Critical Role of LiBr in Avoiding Catalyst Death and its Impact on Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst death&#8230;.&#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is the poison, but LiBr is the cure! During the cross&#8208;coupling of alkylzincs to aryl electrophiles, Pd N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination followed by reductive elimination and aryl&#8208;reductive elimination to create the corresponding NHC&#8208;H or NHC&#8208;aryl salts, with the former being kinetically faster. The use of LiBr curtails this form of catalyst death and allows for dramatically higher turnover numbers (see scheme).







Abstract
The role that LiBr plays in the lifetime of Pd&#8208;NHC complexes has been investigated. A bromide ion is proposed to coordinate to Pd thereby preventing beta hydride elimination (BHE) (to form NHC&#8208;H+) of the reductive elimination (RE) intermediate that normally completes with the desired cross&#8208;coupling catalytic cycle. Coordinating groups, such as anilines, are able to bind suitably well to Pd to prevent this pathway from occurring, thus reducing the need for the added salt. The metal hydride formed from BHE is very unstable and RE of the hydride to the NHC ligand occurs very rapidly giving rise to the corresponding hydrido&#8208;NHC (i.e., NHC&#8208;H+). The use of the per deuterated dibutylzinc shows a significant deuterium isotope effect, shutting down catalyst death almost completely. The use of bis&#8208;neopentylzinc, now possessing no hydrides, eliminates catalyst death all together leading to a very long&#8208;lived catalytic cycle and confirming the untoward role of BHE.

The use of LiBr curtails this form of catalyst death and allows for dramatically higher turnover numbers (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role that LiBr plays in the lifetime of Pd&#8208;NHC complexes has been investigated. A bromide ion is proposed to coordinate to Pd thereby preventing beta hydride elimination (BHE) (to form NHC&#8208;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of the reductive elimination (RE) intermediate that normally completes with the desired cross&#8208;coupling catalytic cycle. Coordinating groups, such as anilines, are able to bind suitably well to Pd to prevent this pathway from occurring, thus reducing the need for the added salt. The metal hydride formed from BHE is very unstable and RE of the hydride to the NHC ligand occurs very rapidly giving rise to the corresponding hydrido&#8208;NHC (i.e., NHC&#8208;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The use of the per deuterated dibutylzinc shows a significant deuterium isotope effect, shutting down catalyst death almost completely. The use of bis&#8208;neopentylzinc, now possessing no hydrides, eliminates catalyst death all together leading to a very long&#8208;lived catalytic cycle and confirming the untoward role of BHE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Energy&#8208;Transfer Dynamics and Color Tunability of Na4CaSi3O9:Tb3+,Eu3+ for Warm White LEDs</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoluminescence properties of Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped Na4CaSi3O9 (NCSO) materials as well as the involved energy&#8208;transfer processes are systemically investigated, indicating the potential use of those phosphors in future lighting applications.







Abstract
In this work, a latent energy&#8208;transfer process in traditional Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped phosphors is proposed and a new class of Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped Na4CaSi3O9 (NCSO) phosphors is presented which is enabled by luminescence decay dynamics that optimize the electron&#8208;transfer energy process. Relative to other Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped phosphors, the as&#8208;synthesized Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped NCSO phosphors show improved large&#8208;scale tunable emission color from green to red upon UV excitation, controlled by the Tb3+/Eu3+ doping ratio. Detailed spectroscopic measurements in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)/UV/Vis region were used to determine the Eu3+&#8211;O2&#8722; charge&#8208;transfer energy, 4f&#8211;5d transition energies, and the energies of 4f excited multiplets of Eu3+ and Tb3+ with different 4fN electronic configurations. The Tb3+&#8594;Eu3+ energy&#8208;transfer pathway in the co&#8208;doped sample was systematically investigated, by employing luminescence decay dynamics analysis to elucidate the relevant energy&#8208;transfer mechanism in combination with the appropriate model simulation. To demonstrate their application potential, a prototype white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) device was successfully fabricated by using the yellow luminescence NCSO:0.03Tb3+, 0.05Eu3+ phosphor with high thermal stability and a BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor in combination with a near&#8208;UV chip. These findings open up a new avenue to realize and develop multifunctional high&#8208;performance phosphors by manipulating the energy&#8208;transfer process for practical applications.

      <title>Distance Matters: Effect of the Spacer Length on the Photophysical Properties of Multimodular Perylenediimide&#8211;Silicon Phthalocyanine&#8211;Fullerene Triads</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced events: Excited state energy transfer leading to 1SiPc*, and electron transfer leading to PDI.&#8722;&#8208;SiPc.+&#8208;C60 charge separated state, in a newly synthesized covalently linked triad featuring C60 and perylene diimide connected at the opposite ends of axial positions of a SiPc, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor conjugate featuring silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) as the electron donor, and two electron acceptors, namely tetrachloroperylenediimide (PDI) and C60, placed at the opposite ends of the SiPc axial positions, was newly designed and synthesized, and the results were compared to the earlier reported PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. Minimal intramolecular interactions between the entities was observed. Absorption, fluorescence, computational and electrochemical studies were performed to evaluate the excitation energy, geometry and electronic structure, and energy levels of different photoevents. Steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence and excitation spectral studies revealed efficient singlet&#8211;singlet energy transfer from 1PDI* to SiPc in the PDI&#8208;SiPc dyad and the PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. The measured rates for these photochemical events were found to be much higher than those reported earlier for the triad, due to closer proximity between the PDI and SiPc entities. The distance also affected the charge separation path in which involvement of PDI, and not C60, in charge separation in the present triad was witnessed. The present investigation brings out the importance of donor&#8211;acceptor distances in channeling photochemical events in a multimodular system.

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes: Progress, Challenges and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
How to prepare heterocycles: Ruthenium(II)&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is discussed, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although RuII centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many RuII&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that RuII centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In this Minireview, an overview of the RuII&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is provided, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

      <title>Photoinitiated Thiol&#8208;ene Reactions of Enoses: A Powerful Tool for Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics with Challenging Glycosidic Linkages</title>
      <dc:description>
UV&#8208;light induced radical&#8208;mediated addition of thiols onto endo&#8208; or exo&#8208;cyclic double bonds of unsaturated sugars offers an easy and stereoselective route to a broad range of stable glycomimetics including 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosides and new types of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
Thioglycosides and C&#8208;glycosides represent pharmacologically useful classes of glycomimetics that possess a high degree of biological stability. One emerging tool for the stereoselective synthesis of thioglycosides is the photoinitiated addition of thiols to unsaturated sugars. Moreover, thiyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions of exo&#8208;glycals and 1&#8208;substituted endo&#8208;glycals offer facile routes to &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosidic structures. This Concept article summarizes the thiol&#8208;ene coupling strategies developed recently by our group and Soms&#225;k's group for the synthesis of several kinds of glycomimetics which are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods. One unusual characteristic of the thiol&#8208;ene reactions of endo&#8208;glycals is that heating inhibits, whereas cooling promotes the reaction. This unique temperature dependence as well as the effects of the enose structures and thiol configurations on the efficacy and stereoselectivity of the reactions are also discussed.

The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin were explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Efficient binding was observed only in hydrogen&#8208;bonded solvents, which indicated solvophobically driven complexation. The stability of the inclusion complex was considerably higher in aqueous media. A pronounced temperature dependence of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675;, resulting in perfect enthalpy&#8211;entropy compensation, was observed in water. The complexation thermodynamics was in line with classical rationale for the hydrophobic effect at lower temperatures and the nonclassical explanation at higher temperatures. This finding linked cyclodextrin complexation thermodynamics with insights regarding the effect of temperature on the hydration water structure. The complexation enthalpies and entropies were weakly dependent on temperature in organic media. The signs of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675; were in accordance with the nonclassical hydrophobic (solvophobic) effect. The structures of the optimized product corresponded to those deduced spectroscopically, and the calculated and experimentally obtained values of &#916;rG&#9675; were in very good agreement. This investigation clearly demonstrated that solvophobically driven formation of cyclodextrin complexes could be anticipated in structured solvents in general. However, unlike in water, adamantane and the host cavity behaved solely as structure breakers in the organic media explored so far.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Chalcogen Bonds: CSD and DFT Analyses and Biological Implication in Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive influences: Searches in the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Database in combination with theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory) show the importance of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonding interactions in crystal structures and in the inhibition mechanism of sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase.







Abstract
This study reports a combined Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical DFT study of charge assisted chalcogen bonds involving sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium cations. The chalcogen bond has been recently defined by IUPAC as the net attractive interaction between an electrophilic region associated with a chalcogen atom in a molecular entity and a nucleophilic region in another, or the same, molecular entity. Divalent chalcogen atoms typically have up to two &#963;&#8208;holes and forms up to two ChBs; the same holds for tetravalent chalcogens which adopt a seesaw arrangement. In sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium salts chalcogen atoms form three covalent bonds, three &#963;&#8208;holes are located opposite to these bonds, and up to three charge assisted ChBs can be formed between these holes and the counterions. The covalent bond arrangement around these chalcogen atoms is similar to trivalent pnictogen atoms and translates into a similar pattern of noncovalent interactions. We have found and studied this type of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonds in various sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase, for example, salacinol and kotalanol.

      <title>[2+2] Photodimerization of Stilbazoles Promoted by Oxalic Acid in Suspension</title>
      <dc:description>
A very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.







Abstract
In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.

      <title>Structural Tunability and Diversity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Lead Halide Benzenethiolate</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 (X=I, Br, or Cl), was synthesized and characterized with experimental and computational methods. These materials feature strong absorption, an extremely large Stokes Shift, and long carrier lifetimes. Interestingly, the bandgap can be tuned by choice of halide, with little to no effect on the photoluminescent emission.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials are currently of great interest for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Here, the synthesis and optical properties of a new type of halide&#8208;organothiolate&#8208;mixed 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3, are reported, in which X is a halide (I, Br, or Cl). Different from conventional lead&#8208;based 2D layered materials, these compounds feature unusual five&#8208;coordinated lead centers with a stereochemically active electron lone pair on the lead atoms and four&#8208;coordinated iodine atoms. The Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 materials feature an indirect bandgap, strongly emissive long&#8208;lived self&#8208;trap states, and an extremely large Stokes shift. Interestingly, the optical bandgap of the materials can be tuned through variation of the halides; however, the photoluminescence is less sensitive to the composition and is more likely dominated by lead&#8208;sulfur lattice interactions or the lead lone&#8208;pair electrons. Our results support that a halide&#8211;organothiolate mixed anion hybrid structure offers a unique platform for discovering new exciting 2D electronic materials.

Proton conductor: A Silver&#8211;bipyridine 1D coordination polymer crystallized with free H3PO4, H2PO4&#8722; and H2O molecules in its lattice form an infinitely extended 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that result in high proton conductivity of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity.

Abstract
Phosphate&#8208;based silver&#8211;bipyridine (Ag&#8208;bpy) 1D coordination polymer {[{Ag(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)}2{Ag(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)(H2PO4)}]&#8901;2&#8201;H2PO4&#8901;H3PO4&#8901;5&#8201;H2O}n (1) with free phosphoric acid (H3PO4), its conjugate base (H2PO4&#8722;) and water molecules in its lattice was synthesized by room&#8208;temperature crystallization and the hydrothermal method. An XRD study showed that coordinated H2PO4&#8722;, lattice H2PO4&#8722; anions, free H3PO4 and lattice water molecules are interconnected by H&#8208;bonding interactions, forming an infinitely extended 2D H&#8208;bonded network that facilitates proton transfer. This material exhibits a high proton conductivity of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, synthesis of this material from commercially available starting materials in water can be easily scaled up, and it is highly stable under extreme conditions of conductivity measurements. This report inaugurates the usage and design principle of proton&#8208;conducting frameworks based on crystallized phosphoric acid and phosphate.

This material exhibits a high proton conductivity of 3.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, synthesis of this material from commercially available starting materials in water can be easily scaled up, and it is highly stable under extreme conditions of conductivity measurements. This report inaugurates the usage and design principle of proton&#8208;conducting frameworks based on crystallized phosphoric acid and phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>
Straightforward &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis: Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed. This reaction proceeds through an intramolecular Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation in the presence of a first&#8208;row transition metal, Cu catalyst, and no DG installation is needed (see scheme).







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs because of their ubiquity in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams using tBuOOtBu. This method is based on Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky amidation and does not require prefunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds or the installation of a directing group, thereby allowing for the straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams. Our intramolecular functionalization protocol can be extended to diverse benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and shows excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance.

      <title>Atom&#8208;Ratio&#8208;Conducted Tailoring of PdAu Bimetallic Nanocrystals with Distinctive Shapes and Dimensions for Boosting the ORR Performance
</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction: 2D PdAu porous nanosheets (PNSs) demonstrate outstanding oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction performance compare to 1D anisotropic nanowires (NWs), 3D penetrative nanofibers (NFs) and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels.







Abstract
Systematically manipulating the shape, dimension, and surface structure of PdAu nanocrystals is an active subject because it offers a powerful means to regulate and investigate their structure&#8211;activity relationship. Meanwhile, it is still urgent to reduce the use of two&#8208;dimensional precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials. This work demonstrates that PdAu nanocrystals with a variety of shapes/dimensions, including 1D anisotropic nanowires, 2D porous nanosheets, and 3D penetrative nanoflowers, can be systematically synthesized by simply adjusting the atomic ratio or the reaction time in the same protocol. The resultant PdAu nanocrystals with distinctive shapes, but the same building blocks triumphantly avoid the effects of facet and surface properties; this represents an ideal platform for directly comparing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. 2D porous PdAu nanosheets demonstrate superior ORR performance (Eonset = 1.040&#8197;V, E1/2 = 0.932&#8197;V) compared with other&#8208;dimension&#8208;based samples and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels. This work not only paves the way for systematically measuring a series of distinctive PdAu nanocrystals as non&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts, but also sheds light on the study of structures/dimensions in tuning the catalytic properties of bimetallic nanocrystals.

      <title>How to Bend a Cumulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend it: [n]Cumulenes are known for the linearity of their carbon chains, but when the terminal groups are N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, this situation changes. The even cumulenes of this family can be bent depending on the &#960; acidity of the carbene terminal group. Poor &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the carbon chain to the terminal group promotes a significant bending in the carbon chain.







Abstract
Allenes (carbodicarbenes) and [3]cumulenes are linear carbon chains that can be bent when the terminal group has a strong carbene nature. This bending can be quite pronounced in allenes but not in [3]cumulenes. In this study, how N&#8208;heterocyclic or cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (NHC and CAAC, respectively) terminal groups can modify the linear structure of [n]cumulenes has been analyzed. A low &#960; acidity of the terminal carbene affects the linearity of [2n]cumulenes. Indeed, it has been found that the NHC [4]cumulene is extremely bent, contrary to classical [4]cumulenes. The predicted NHC [4]cumulene or tricarbodicarbene has two lone pairs and the &#960; electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule. More significantly, DFT calculations have shown that this bent [4]cumulene is very stable, considerably more so than the corresponding [3]cumulene, which has been elusive to synthesize. Remarkably, calculations have shown that all the NHC [2n]cumulenes are more than 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the [2n&#8722;1]cumulenes.

      <title>A Facile Grinding Method for the Synthesis of 3D Ag Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Containing Ag6Mo7O24 for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
The daily grind: Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) compounds are successfully synthesized by a simple grinding method. The resulting {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) has the high specific capacitance of 971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (higher than other compounds), excellent rate ability, and long cycle stability. In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Successful synthesis of three kinds of dynamically stable compounds by a simple grinding method is reported, giving Ag6Mo7O24, Ag&#8208;BTC (Ag&#8208;MOF, BTC=benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid), and {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). According to the electrochemical dynamic analysis, these materials have pseudocapacitor behavior and high capacitance. The unique nanorod structure of {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF provides more active sites, faster ion/electron transfer, and electrolyte diffusion pathways, resulting in excellent specific capacitance (971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) higher than the other compounds. {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) also has an excellent rate ability (60.1&#8201;%) and long cycle stability (98&#8201;% retention after 5000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery (with nickel foam as the current collector) fabricated with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V. These results demonstrate a new simple grinding method to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) for high&#8208;performance materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful synthesis of three kinds of dynamically stable compounds by a simple grinding method is reported, giving Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, Ag&#8208;BTC (Ag&#8208;MOF, BTC=benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid), and {Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}@Ag&#8208;MOF metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). According to the electrochemical dynamic analysis, these materials have pseudocapacitor behavior and high capacitance. The unique nanorod structure of {Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}@Ag&#8208;MOF provides more active sites, faster ion/electron transfer, and electrolyte diffusion pathways, resulting in excellent specific capacitance (971&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) higher than the other compounds. {Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) also has an excellent rate ability (60.1&#8201;%) and long cycle stability (98&#8201;% retention after 5000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery (with nickel foam as the current collector) fabricated with {Ag&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V. These results demonstrate a new simple grinding method to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) for high&#8208;performance materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes Aromatic or Not? A DFT Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>
Calculating substitutes: Aromaticity dependence is found in hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes. Specifically, metallazapentalene exhibits comparable aromaticity to that of metallapentalene, whereas lower aromaticity and nonaromaticity are suggested in metallaborapentalene and metalloxapentalene, respectively.







Abstract
Aromaticity is one of the most basic concepts in organic chemistry. The planar M&#246;bius aromatic metallapentalynes and metallapentalenes have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. However, the aromaticity of metallapentalenes containing heteroatoms (such as B, N, and O), termed as hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes, is rarely studied. Herein, the stability and aromaticity of a series of hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes are theoretically investigated. The results reveal lower aromaticity in metallaborapentalene, comparable aromaticity in metallazapentalene, and nonaromaticity in metalloxapentalene relative to that of metallapentalene. Moreover, the effect of Lewis bases on the aromaticity and stability of metallaborapentalene is discussed. These results provide useful information for experimental chemists to realize more hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes.

      <title>Functionalised N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Bimetallic Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic carbene complexes: This minireview covers the use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands in the formation of bimetallic architectures. NHCs are shown to bind one metal through the conventional C2 position and coordinate to another through donor atoms tethered to the NHC, through the N atom itself or through the NHC backbone. These bimetallic species are potentially useful models for decomposition reactions in homogeneous catalysis and organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become immensely successful ligands in coordination chemistry and homogeneous catalysis due to their strong terminal &#963;&#8208;donor properties. However, by targeting NHC ligands with additional functionalisation, a new area of NHC coordination chemistry has developed that has enabled NHCs to be used to build up bimetallic and multimetallic architectures. This minireview covers the development of functionalised NHC ligands that incorporate additional donor sites in order to coordinate two or more metal atoms. This can be through the N&#8208;atom of the NHC ring, through a donor group attached to the N&#8208;atom or the carbon backbone, coordination of the &#960;&#8208;bond or an annulated &#960;&#8208;donor on the backbone, or through direct metalation of the backbone.

      <title>Strategies for the Controlled Covalent Double Functionalization of Graphene Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Twice is better than once: A double and mild functionalization strategy of graphene oxide is reported based on the combination of a nucleophilic epoxide opening and hydroxyl derivatization by esterification or Williamson reaction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile platform with unique properties that have found broad applications in the biomedical field. Double functionalization is a key aspect in the design of multifunctional GO with combined imaging, targeting, and therapeutic properties. Compared to noncovalent functionalization, covalent strategies lead to GO conjugates with a higher stability in biological fluids. However, only a few double covalent functionalization approaches have been developed so far. The complexity of GO makes the derivatization of the oxygenated groups difficult to control. The combination of a nucleophilic epoxide ring opening with the derivatization of the hydroxyl groups through esterification or Williamson reaction was investigated. The conditions were selective and mild, thus preserving the structure of GO. Our strategy of double functionalization holds great potential for different applications in which the derivatization of GO with different molecules is needed, especially in the biomedical field.

      <title>A Reusable CNT&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of C&#8722;N Bonds
</title>
      <dc:description>
A superior commoner! A reusable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs, prepared from iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been used for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. The catalytic performance superior to those of noble&#8208;metal catalysts such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. This outstanding performance originates from the introduction of Fe&#8208;Nx into the CNTs and the resulting electronic coupling between the iron species and the CNTs.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation is regarded as a very useful and fundamental reaction for the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Noble&#8208;metal and homogeneous catalysts have frequently been used for C&#8722;N bond formation, however, these catalysts have a number of disadvantages, such as high cost, toxicity, and low atom economy. In this work, a low&#8208;toxic and cheap iron complex (iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) has been loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to prepare a heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) named Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs. We employed this SAC in the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds for the first time. It was found that Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs is an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds starting from aromatic amines and ketones. Its catalytic performance was excellent, giving yields of up to 96&#8201;%, six&#8208;fold higher than the yields obtained with noble&#8208;metal catalysts, such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. The catalyst showed efficacy in the reactions of thirteen aromatic amine substrates, without the need for additives, and seventeen enaminones were obtained. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iron species were well dispersed in the Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst as single atoms and that Fe&#8208;Nx might be the catalytic active species. This Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst has potential industrial applications as it could be cycled seven times without any significant loss of activity.

      <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Regiodivergent Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Mupirocin Methyl Ester</title>
      <dc:description>
endo vs. exo: Chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are used for achieving regiocontrol over the endo vs. exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin methyl ester. This approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. The mechanism of these reactions is investigated by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions.







Abstract
This article presents a new strategy for achieving regiocontrol over the endo versus exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing alcohols, which leads to the formation of five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered cyclic ethers. Unlike traditional methods relying on achiral reagents or enzymes, this approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. By using methyl ester of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin as the substrate, it is demonstrated that catalytic chiral phosphoric acids (R)&#8208;TCYP and (S)&#8208;TIPSY could be used to achieve the selective formation of either the six&#8208;membered endo product (95:5 r.r.) or the five&#8208;membered exo product (77:23 r.r.), correspondingly. This cyclization was found to be unselective under the standard conditions involving various achiral acids, bases, or buffers. The subsequent mechanistic studies using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions provided the description of the potential energy surface, which is fully consistent with the experimental observations. Based on these results, highly detailed reaction paths are obtained and a concerted and highly synchronous mechanism is proposed for the formation of both exo and endo products.

&lt;/i&gt;: Chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are used for achieving regiocontrol over the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin methyl ester. This approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. The mechanism of these reactions is investigated by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents a new strategy for achieving regiocontrol over the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing alcohols, which leads to the formation of five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered cyclic ethers. Unlike traditional methods relying on achiral reagents or enzymes, this approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. By using methyl ester of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin as the substrate, it is demonstrated that catalytic chiral phosphoric acids (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;TCYP and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;TIPSY could be used to achieve the selective formation of either the six&#8208;membered &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; product (95:5 r.r.) or the five&#8208;membered &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; product (77:23 r.r.), correspondingly. This cyclization was found to be unselective under the standard conditions involving various achiral acids, bases, or buffers. The subsequent mechanistic studies using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions provided the description of the potential energy surface, which is fully consistent with the experimental observations. Based on these results, highly detailed reaction paths are obtained and a concerted and highly synchronous mechanism is proposed for the formation of both &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; products.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Engineering of Laccase CueO for Improved Electron Transfer in Bioelectrocatalysis by Semi&#8208;Rational Design</title>
      <dc:description>
As a promising cathodic biocatalyst in enzymatic biofuel cells, laccase CueO catalyzes oxygen reduction efficiently thanks to the supplemental Cu binding. Substituting at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu binding site was shown to enable the manipulation of electrocatalytic current, which is more remarkable than substitution at the conventional Cu active sites.







Abstract
Copper efflux oxidase (CueO) from Escherichia coli is a special bacterial laccase due to its fifth copper binding site. Herein, it is discovered that the fifth Cu occupancy plays a crucial and favorable role of electron relay in bioelectrocatalytic oxygen reduction. By substituting the residues at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu, 11 beneficial variants are identified with &#8805;2.5&#8208;fold increased currents at &#8722;250&#8197;mV (up to 6.13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Detailed electrocatalytic characterization suggests the microenvironment of the fifth Cu binding site governs the electrocatalytic current of CueO. Additionally, further electron transfer analysis assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation demonstrates that an increase in localized structural stability and a decrease of distance between the fifth Cu and the T1 Cu are two main factors contributing to the improved kinetics of CueO variants. It may guide a novel way to tailor laccases and perhaps other oxidoreductases for bioelectrocatalytic applications.
