      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Boron Complexes with a Carbazoyl Schiff Base</title>
      <dc:description>A variety of carbazolyl&#8208;appended Schiff bases were readily synthesized from 1&#8208;formylcarbazoles and aniline derivatives. Boron complexation of the resulting ligands allowed facile preparations of new carbazole&#8208;based BODIPY analogues showing solid&#8208;state fluorescence.

      <title>Better Together: Functional Heterobimetallic Macrocyclic and Cage&#8208;like Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Metallosupramolecular chemistry has attracted the interest of generations of researches due to the versatile properties and functionalities of oligonuclear coordination complexes. Quite a number of different discrete cages were investigated, mostly consi&#8208;sting of only one type of ligand and one type of metal cation. Looking for ever more complex structures, heterobimetallic complexes became more and more attractive, as they give access to new structural motifs and functions. In the last years substantial success has been made in the design and synthesis of cages consisting of more than one type of metal cations, and a rapidly growing number of functional materials has appeared in the literature. This minireview describes recent developments in the field of discrete heterometallic macrocycles and cages focusing on functional materials that have been used as host&#8208;systems or as magnetic, photo&#8208;active, redox&#8208;active, and even catalytically active materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium Nanoparticles as a Novel Photosensitizing Agent in Photodynamic Therapy against Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy is a promising alternative treatment for different types of cancer due to its high selectivity, which prevents healthy tissues from being damaged. The use of nanomaterials in photodynamic therapy has several advantages over classical photosensitizing agents, due to their unique properties and their ability to be functionalized. Especially interesting is the use of metallic nanoparticles, capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation to either transfer this energy to oxygen molecules for the generation of ROS or dissipate it as heat. Although previous reports have demonstrated the capacity of Rh derivatives as anti&#8208;tumour drugs, there are no studies on the potential of small&#8208;sized Rh nanoparticles as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. In this study, 5 nm Rh nanoparticles has been synthesized and their potential in photodynamic therapy has been evaluated.

      <dc:description>Electroactive organic molecules have received a lot of attention in the field of electronics because of their fascinating electronic properties, easy functionalization and potential low cost towards their implementation in electronic devices. In recent years, electroactive organic molecules have also emerged as promising building blocks for the design and construction of crystalline porous frameworks such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks (COFs) for application in electronics. Such porous materials present certain additional advantages such as, for example, an immense structural and functional versatility, combination of porosity with multiple electronic properties and the possibility of tuning their physical properties by post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In this review, we summarize the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials (MOFs &amp; COFs) for electronics with special emphasis on their electronic structure and functionality relationships. The different building blocks have been classified based on the electronic nature and main function of the resulting porous frameworks. The design and synthesis of novel electroactive organic molecules is encouraged towards the construction of functional porous frameworks exhibiting new functionalities and applications in electronics.</dc:description>

In particular, combinations of electrocatalysts in carbon&#160;have&#160;shown promising activity. A method to derive functional carbon materials is from pyrolysis of metallopolymers.

The characterization of the polymers and the derived ceramics are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Heavy Atom Tunneling in Semibullvalenes: How Driving Force, Substituents, and Environment Influence the Tunneling Rates</title>
      <dc:description>The Cope rearrangement of selectively deuterated isotopomers of 1,5&#8208;dimethylsemibullvalene 2a and 3,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#173;semibullvalene 2b were studied in cryogenic matrices. In both semibullvalenes the Cope rearrangement is governed by heavy atom tunneling (HAT). The driving force for the rearrangements is the small difference in the zero&#8208;point vibrational energies of the isotopomers. To evaluate the effect of the driving force on the tunneling probability in 2a and 2b, two different pairs of isotopomers were studied for each of the semibullvalenes. The reaction rates for the rearrangement of 2b in cryogenic matrices were found to be smaller than the ones of 2a under similar conditions, whereas differences in the driving force do not influence the rates. Small curvature tunneling (SCT) calculations suggest that the reduced tunneling rate of 2b compared to that of 2a results from a change in the shape of the potential energy barrier. The tunneling probability of the semibullvalenes strongly depends on the matrix environment, however, for 2a in a qualitatively different way than for 2b.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanism and Origin of MAD&#8208;Induced Ni/N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective C&#8722;H Cyclization of Pyridines with Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
DFT calculations show a new mechanism, in which a unique H&#8208;migration assisted oxidation metalation (HMAOM) step is identified as the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The newly proposed mechanism can well rationalize the regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H cyclization of pyridines with alkenes and also unveil the reasons that the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand and the MAD additive can facilitate the reaction (see figure).







Abstract
This work presents a DFT&#8208;based computational study on the regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines with alkenes at the relatively unreactive C4&#8208;position, which was successfully achieved by Shi et&#8197;al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 5628&#8211;5634] using Ni0/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under the assistance of an aluminum&#8208;based Lewis acid additive (2,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;C6H2O)2AlMe (MAD). The calculations indicate that the selective functionalization involves a three&#8208;step mechanism in which a unique H&#8208;migration assisted oxidation metalation (HMAOM) step is identified as the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The newly proposed mechanism can well rationalize the experimental observation that the preferred product is the endo&#8208;type (vs. exo&#8208;type), R&#8208;configuration (vs. S&#8208;configuration) product at the C4 (vs. C2) position, and also unveil the reasons that the NHC ligand and the MAD additive can facilitate the reaction.

      <title>Stability, Structure and Reconstruction of 1H&#8208;Edges in MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
A complete density functional study of S&#8208;terminated edges in 1H&#8208;MoS2 finds new potential entropically favored structures for Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges, and proposes a Peierls&#8217; distortion model explaining the stability of triply periodic Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges.







Abstract
Density functional studies of the edges of single&#8208;layer 1H&#8208;MoS2 are presented. This phase presents a rich variability of edges that can influence the morphology and properties of MoS2 nano&#8208;objects, play an important role in industrial chemical processes, and find future applications in energy storage, electronics and spintronics. The so&#8208;called Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges vertical S&#8208;dimers were confirmed to be stable, however the authors also identified a family of metastable edges combining Mo atoms linked by two&#8208;electron donor symmetrical disulfide ligands and four&#8208;electron donor unsymmetrical disulfide ligands. These may be entropically favored, potentially stabilizing them at high temperatures as a &#8220;liquid edge&#8221; phase. For Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges, S&#8208;bridge structures with 3&#215; periodicity along the edge are the most stable, compatible with a Peierls&#8217; distortion arising from the d&#8208;bands of the edge Mo atoms. An additional explanation for this periodicity is proposed through the formation of 3&#8208;center bonds.

      <title>Exploring the Biocatalytic Potential of Fe/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate halogenases are turning into valuable tools for the stereoselective incorporation of halogen atoms into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. To date, halogenases which selectively derivatize free amino acids or indole alkaloids have been discovered. While first enzyme engineering examples highlight that the substrate scope can be expanded, structural and biochemical characterizations continue to inform about the enzymes&#8217; catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Freestanding Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the installation of halogen atoms into unactivated sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon centers with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Since their discovery in 2014, a small number of indole alkaloid and amino acid halogenases have been identified and characterized. First enzyme engineering examples suggest that the accessible substrate range of these enzymes may be expanded through the use of rational enzyme design and directed evolution. Structural investigations of non&#8208;heme iron halogenases acting on freestanding as well as tethered substrates are beginning to inform about the principles of the underlying halogenation mechanism.

Radical chemistry! The use of gem&#8208;bis&#8208;metalated&#8208;alkenes, that is, vinyl gem&#8208;diboron&#8208;compounds, as radical&#8208;labile substrates is explored.

This methodology can serve as the late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules and simple organic molecules in which it drives the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylalkanes (see scheme).







Abstract
The use of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes as radical&#8208;reactive groups is explored for the first time. These reactions provide an efficient and general method for the photochemical conversion of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to rapidly access 1,1&#8208;bisborylalkanes. This method exploits a novel photoredox decarboxylative radical addition to gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to afford &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;diboryl carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which benefit from additional stability by virtue of an interaction with the empty p&#8208;orbitals on borons. The reaction offers a highly modular and regioselective approach to &#947;&#8208;amino gem&#8208;diborylalkanes. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have provided insight into the radical mechanism underlying the photochemistry reaction and the stability of the bis&#8208;metalated radicals, respectively.

      <title>C&#8722;F Arylation of Polyfluorophenols by Means of Sigmatropic Dearomatization/Defluorination Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence: interrupted Pummerer reaction, [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization, and Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The utility of the strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost (see scheme).







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence. This sequence consists of three processes: 1)&#8197;interrupted Pummerer reaction to form S&#8722;O&#8208;tethered sulfonium salt; 2)&#8197;C&#8722;C&#8208;forming [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization; and 3)&#8197;Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The present biaryl construction provides a facile access to polyfluorinated biaryls that is difficult to synthesize by other methods. The synthetic utility of the strategy is clearly demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost, a potassium channel modulator.

      <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Carbon&#8208;Bound Boron Difluoride Hydrazone Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron difluoride hydrazone dimers exhibit structurally tunable and sometimes unexpected absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. These findings are rationalized using DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments (see figure).







Abstract
The creation of dimeric boron difluoride complexes of chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is a proven strategy for the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of fluorescent dyes. We report dimers based on the boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) framework, which offer unique and sometimes unexpected substituent&#8208;dependent absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. BODIHY dimers have low&#8208;energy absorption bands (&#955;max=421 to 479&#8197;nm, &#1013;=17&#8201;200 to 39&#8201;900&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) that are red&#8208;shifted relative to monomeric analogues. THF solutions of these dimers exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon addition of water, with emission enhancement factors ranging from 5 to 18. Thin films of BODIHY dimers are weakly emissive as a result of the inner&#8208;filter effect, attributed to intermolecular &#960;&#8208;type interactions. BODIHY dimers are redox&#8208;active and display two one&#8208;electron oxidation and two one&#8208;electron reduction waves that strongly depend on the N&#8208;aryl substituents. These properties are rationalized using density&#8208;functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments.

      <title>Synthesis of 3D IrRuMn Sphere as a Superior Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Acidic Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Spherical electrocatalyst: A spherical IrRuMn catalyst is synthesized through a wet chemical approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional performance for the OER, with an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic media.







Abstract
The design of a three&#8208;dimensional structure for an Ir&#8208;based catalyst offers a great opportunity to improve the electrocatalytic performance and maximize the use of the precious metal. Herein, a novel wet chemical strategy is reported for the synthesis of an IrRuMn catalyst with a sphere structure and porous features. In the synthetic process, the combined use of citric acid and formamide is requisite for the formation of the sphere structure. This method leads to a favorable 3D IrRuMn sphere structure with many fully exposed active sites. Furthermore, an alloying noble metal, such as Ir or Ru, with the transition metal leads to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The doping of a transition metal, such as Mn, is an interesting example, because it exhibits stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline media. For the OER, the IrRuMn sphere catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic 0.1&#8201;m HClO4, which is superior to that of a commercial IrO2/C catalyst. This approach provides a novel way to synthesize an Ir&#8208;based multimetallic spherical electrocatalyst, which exhibits exceptional efficiency for the acidic OER. It will pave the way for new approaches to the practical utilization of PEM electrolyzers.

      <title>FeIII&#8211;Salen&#8208;Based Probes for the Selective and Sensitive Detection of E450 in Foodstuff</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective brightness: A selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe that fluorometrically detects pyrophosphate (alias E450) in baking powder by a disassembly approach is described.







Abstract
Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is considered as a diagnostic marker for various diseases such as cancer and vascular calcification. PPi also plays an important preservative role as an additive E450 in foodstuff. In this work, a selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe for PPi is described; this probe disassembles in the presence of the target analyte into its molecular blocks, 1,2&#8208;propanediamine and 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. The latter signaling unit leads to a fluorometric response. Compared with a related prototype, the new complex shows a 2.3&#8208;times stronger emission at 500&#8197;nm and a 155&#8208;times better selectivity of PPi over adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Importantly, the new probe was successfully applied for detecting E450 in foodstuff.

      <title>Samarium(II) Monoalkyl Complex Supported by a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato&#8208;Based Tetradentate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
A five&#8208;coordinate samarium(II) monoalkyl complex is synthesized and structurally characterized. This complex shows high catalytic activity and high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydrosilylation of various aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes under mild conditions (see scheme).







Abstract
The synthesis and catalytic applications of trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes have been well developed, but the chemistry of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes lagged much behind. Herein, we report the synthesis, structure, and catalytic applications of a samarium(II) monoalkyl complex supported by a &#946;&#8208;diketiminato&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, [LSmCH(SiMe3)2] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(Me)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3). This complex is synthesized by the salt metathesis reaction of samarium iodide [LSm(&#956;&#8208;I)]2 and KCH(SiMe3)2 in 63&#8201;% yield. Its structure is characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing a distorted square&#8208;pyramid coordination geometry. This samarium(II) monoalkyl complex exhibits high catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes, selectively providing the &#945;&#8208;(E) products in high yields.

     alt="Samarium(II) Monoalkyl Complex Supported by a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato&#8208;Based Tetradentate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A five&#8208;coordinate&lt;/b&gt; samarium(II) monoalkyl complex is synthesized and structurally characterized. This complex shows high catalytic activity and high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydrosilylation of various aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes under mild conditions (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and catalytic applications of trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes have been well developed, but the chemistry of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes lagged much behind. Herein, we report the synthesis, structure, and catalytic applications of a samarium(II) monoalkyl complex supported by a &#946;&#8208;diketiminato&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, [LSmCH(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(Me)NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(Me)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This complex is synthesized by the salt metathesis reaction of samarium iodide [LSm(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;I)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and KCH(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 63&#8201;% yield. Its structure is characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing a distorted square&#8208;pyramid coordination geometry. This samarium(II) monoalkyl complex exhibits high catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes, selectively providing the &#945;&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;) products in high yields.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Panchromatic Light Harvesting and Stabilizing Charge&#8208; Separated States in Corrole&#8208;Phthalocyanine Conjugates through Coordinating a Subphthalocyanine</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to the electron donating and accepting nature of corroles (Corr) and phthalocyanines (Pc), respectively, we designed and developed two novel covalently linked Corr&#8208;Pc conjugates. The synthetic route allows the preparation of the target conjugates in satisfying yields. Comprehensive steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled insights onto energy and electron transfer processes upon photoexcitation. Coordinating a pyridine&#8208;appended subphthalocyanine (SubPc) to the Pc of the conjugate sets up the ways and means to realize the first example of an array composed by three different porphyrinoids, which drives a cascade of energy and charge transfer processes occur. Importantly, the SubPc assists in stabilizing the charge&#8208;separated state, that is, one&#8208;electron oxidized Corr and the one electron reduced Pc, upon photoexcitation by means of a reductive charge transfer to the SubPc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an intramolecular oxidation of a Corr within electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugates by means of just photoexcitation. Moreover, the combination of Corr, Pc, and SubPc guarantees panchromatic absorption across the visible range of the solar spectrum, with the SubPc covering the &#8220;green gap&#8221; that usually affects porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF and COF Nanosheets: Synthesis and Applications in Electrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials for electrochemistry: Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets represent one promising kind of power materials for electrochemical. Synthesis strategies, tailored material properties and different electrochemical performances are prominent features of supercapacitors, batteries, OER and HER. Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets comprehensively summarized and evaluations are given in this Review.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with unique design principles and various synthesis methods. They are considered ideal electrochemical devices due to the ultrathin thickness, easily tunable molecular structure, large porosity and other unique properties. There are two common methods to synthesize 2D MOF/COF nanosheets: bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down. The top&#8208;down strategy mainly includes ultrasonic assisted exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation and mechanical exfoliation. Another strategy mainly includes interface synthesis, modulation synthesis, surfactant&#8208;assisted synthesis. In this Review, the development of ultrathin 2D nanosheets in the field of electrochemistry (supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution) is introduced, and their unique dimensional advantages are highlighted.

      <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of Hydrazones: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
A new protocol: The first asymmetric catalyzed aza&#8208;Henry reaction of hydrazones is presented. In this process, quinine was used as the catalyst to synthesize a variety of alkyl substituted &#946;&#8208;nitrohydrazides with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;ee. Additionally, experimental and ab initio studies were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. The results revealed a concerted mode of activation in which a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction and a protonation occur simultaneously.







Abstract
The first asymmetric catalyzed aza&#8208;Henry reaction of hydrazones is presented. In this process, quinine was used as the catalyst to synthesize different alkyl substituted &#946;&#8208;nitrohydrazides with ee up to 77&#8201;%. This ee was improved up to 94&#8201;% by a further recrystallization and the opposite enantiomer can be obtained by using quinidine as the catalyst, opening exciting possibilities in fields in which the control of chirality is vital, such as the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, experimental and ab initio studies were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. The experimental results revealed an unexpected secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) that is explained by the calculated reaction pathway, which shows that the protonation of the initial hydrazone and the C&#8722;C bond forming reaction occur during a concerted process. This concerted mechanism makes the catalysis conceptually different to traditional base&#8208;promoted Henry and aza&#8208;Henry reactions.

      <title>A Thioxanthone Sensitizer with a Chiral Phosphoric Acid Binding Site: Properties and Applications in Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cycloadditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Bind me tender: Cyclic enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids (X=CH2, O) display a binding motif (in blue) for an assembly with chiral acid 1. The acid acts as photocatalyst by transferring the energy of visible photons to the substrate via its thioxanthone substituents (in yellow) enabling an enantioselective [2+2] photocycloaddition (see scheme).







Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid with a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;binaphthol core was prepared that displays two thioxanthone moieties at the 3,3&#8217;&#8208;position as light&#8208;harvesting antennas. Despite its relatively low triplet energy, the phosphoric acid was found to be an efficient catalyst for the enantioselective intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;substituted cyclic enones (e.r. up to 93:7). Binding of the carboxylic acid to the sensitizer is suggested by NMR studies and by DFT calculations to occur by means of two hydrogen bonds. The binding event not only enables an enantioface differentiation but also modulates the triplet energy of the substrates.

This reaction represents a rare example of realizing the challenging double C&#8722;P bond formation at a single carbon atom, thus providing facile access to a broad variety of structurally diverse bisphosphonates from simple enamides under silver&#8208;mediated conditions. Initial mechanistic studies demonstrated that the diphosphorylation involves two rounds of PCET&#8208;initiated radical relay process.

      <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Polydopamine Formation by Amyloid Fibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Roped together: Inspired by melanin biosynthesis process, amyloid fibers were used to regulate polydopamine formation. The presence of amyloid fibers accelerated polydopamine formation, and the resultant polydopamine&#8211;amyloid composites exhibited different materials properties to those of polydopamine. Amyloids made of different proteins had similar influences on polydopamine formation, indicating that the supramolecular structure is responsible for the observed regulating functions (see scheme).







Abstract
Polydopamine (PD) and melanin species are chemically complex systems, the formation and properties of which are incompletely understood. Inspired by the role of functional amyloids in melanin biosynthesis, this paper examines the influences of the supramolecular structure of amyloids on oxidative polymerization of dopamine. Kinetic analyses on the formation of PD species in the presence of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) fibers or soluble HEWL revealed that both forms gave rise to the total quantity of PD species, but the rate of their formation could be accelerated only by the amyloid form. PD species formed with HEWL fibers showed a morphology of bundled fibers, whereas those with soluble HEWL had a mesh&#8208;like structure. Amyloid fibers of recombinant Pmel17 had properties similar to those of HEWL fibers in modulating PD formation. The results presented here suggest how nature designs functionality with an amyloid structure and can help understand and engineer chemistries of other functional amyloids.

      <title>A Novel [OSSO]&#8208;Type Chromium(III) Complex as a Versatile Catalyst for Copolymerization of Carbon Dioxide with Epoxides</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#8220;green&#8221; polycarbonates from carbon dioxide and epoxides was accomplished by using a chromium catalyst bearing an [OSSO]&#8208;ligand. The unprecedented versatility of the complex and its efficiency in reactions involving linear and internal epoxides led obtaining polycarbonates with different architectures. Catalytic behavior was rationalized through DFT calculations.







Abstract
A new chromium(III) complex, bearing a bis&#8208;thioether&#8208;diphenolate [OSSO]&#8208;type ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst in the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides to achieve poly(propylene carbonate), poly(cyclohexene carbonate), poly(hexene carbonate) and poly(styrene carbonate), as well as poly(propylene carbonate)(cyclohexene carbonate) and poly(propylene carbonate)(hexene carbonate) terpolymers.

      <title>Fundamental Aspects of Xanthene Dye Aggregation on the Surfaces of Nanocluster Polyoxometalates: H&#8208; to J&#8208;Aggregate Switching</title>
      <dc:description>
What is favorable? The deep understanding of the thermodynamic reasons leading to H&#8208;dimer formation on the surfaces of highly symmetric polyoxometalate nanoclusters is explored and the fundamental way to switch H&#8208; to J&#8208;aggregates by the design of outer shell is uncovered: H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates coexistence in the comb&#8208;like monolayer structure.







Abstract
The induced aggregation of the xanthene dye rhodamine&#8197;B (RhB) on metal oxide centers belonging to the highly symmetric surfaces of precise nanoscale templates with Keplerate (Mo132) or toroidal (Mo138) structures has been studied. With the joint use of the Langmuir isotherm and full Stern&#8211;Volmer models, the thermodynamic reasons for dye adsorption on the nanocluster surface, such as a mixture of monomer, H&#8208;aggregate (H&#8208;dimer), and J&#8208;aggregate forms (which can coexist or switch one into another under the exact conditions), were established: this was shown through UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. By using the framework of the exciton model, it is shown that the angle (&#945;) between the transition dipole moments of RhB is very sensitive to surface strain inside the dye sub&#8208;monolayer. As a result, it is possible to switch from H&#8208; to J&#8208;aggregates by the post&#8208;functionalization of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;RhB associates by the surfactant bilayer shell, which allows the surface strain to grow. Recommendations are provided for managing the appearance of H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregates on metal oxide (or polyelectrolyte) surfaces during photovoltaic or bioimaging applications.

Recommendations are provided for managing the appearance of H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregates on metal oxide (or polyelectrolyte) surfaces during photovoltaic or bioimaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships for the Affinity of Chaotropic Polyoxometalate Anions towards Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and QSAR&#8208;like modeling techniques were applied to establish relationships between the structure of chaotropic polyoxometalate (POM) anions and their affinity towards biological systems. The charge density, size, and shape of POMs were identified as important parameters to balance the POM interactions with the protein and with the solvent (see figure).







Abstract
The influence of the composition of chaotropic polyoxometalate (POM) anions on their affinity to biological systems was studied by means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The variations in the affinity to hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) were analyzed along two series of POMs whereby the charge or the size and shape of the metal cluster are modified systematically. Our simulations revealed a quadratic relationship between the charge of the POM and its affinity to HEWL as a consequence of the parabolic growth of POM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;water interaction with the charge. As the charge increases, POMs become less chaotropic (more kosmotropic) increasing the number and the strength of POM&#8211;water hydrogen bonds and structuring the solvation shell around the POM. This atomistic description explains the proportionally larger desolvation energies and less protein affinity for highly charged POMs, and consequently, the preference for moderate charge densities (q/M=0.33). Also, our simulations suggest that POM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;protein interactions are size&#8208;specific. The cationic pockets of HEWL protein show a preference for Keggin&#8208;like structures, which display the optimal dimensions (&#8776;1&#8197;nm). Finally, we developed a quantitative multidimensional model for protein affinity with predictive ability (r2=0.97; q2=0.88) using two molecular descriptors that account for the charge density (charge per metal atom ratio; q/M) and the size and shape (shape weighted&#8208;volume; VS).

      <title>Bright Luminescent Platinum(II)&#8208;Biaryl Emitters Synthesized Without Air&#8208;Sensitive Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>
Pt complexes made easy: Platinum(II) complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands were synthesized without any air&#8208; or moisture&#8208;sensitive reagents, such as n&#8208;butyllithium. The prepared complexes exhibited intense green emission with high quantum efficiency of up to 0.80, even at 298&#8197;K, because of their tightly packed structure and because of the strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability of the biaryl ligand.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands tend to show intense luminescence. However, difficulties in synthesis have prevented their further functionalization and practical applications. Herein, a series of platinum(II) complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands, which have never been prepared in air, were synthesized through transmetalation and successive cyclometalation of biarylboronic acids. This approach does not require any air&#8208; or moisture&#8208;sensitive reagents and features a simple synthesis even in air. The resulting (Et4N)2[Pt(m,n&#8208;F2bph)(CN)2] (m,n&#8208;F2bph=m,n&#8208;difluorobiphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl) complexes exhibit intense green emissions with high quantum efficiencies of up to 0.80 at 298&#8197;K. The emission spectral fitting and variable&#8208;temperature emission lifetime measurements indicate that the high quantum efficiency was achieved because of the tight packing structure and strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability of bph.

      <dc:description>
Not just MoS2! A comprehensive Review article on 2D transition metal dichalcogenide based electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices, beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Recent progress, challenges, and research opportunities related to use of TMD electrodes in advanced alkali metal&#8208;ion rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically thin sheets of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted interest as high capacity electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their unique properties (high surface area, high strength and modulus, faster ion diffusion, and so on), which arise from their layered morphology and diversified chemistry. Nevertheless, low electronic conductivity, poor cycling stability, large structural changes during metal&#8208;ion insertion/extraction along with high cost of manufacture are challenges that require further research in order for TMDs to find use in commercial batteries and supercapacitors. Here, a systematic review of cutting&#8208;edge research focused on TMD materials beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide or MoS2 electrode is reported. Accordingly, a critical overview of the recent progress concerning synthesis methods, physicochemical and electrochemical properties is given. Trends and opportunities that may contribute to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research are also discussed.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Quantum Dots using Organic Templates</title>
      <dc:description>
Control over the self&#8208;assembly of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), is a great challenge. In this Minireview, the self&#8208;assemblies of QDs with organic template molecules are highlighted (see figure), which should facilitate future advances in materials science related to assembled QDs.







Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), are regarded as brightly photoluminescent nanomaterials possessing outstanding photophysical properties, such as high photodurability and tunable absorption and emission wavelengths. Therefore, QDs have great potential for a wide range of applications, such as in photoluminescent materials, biosensors and photovoltaic devices. Since the development of synthetic methods for accessing high&#8208;quality QDs with uniform morphology and size, various types of QDs have been designed and synthesized, and their photophysical properties dispersed in solutions and at the single QD level have been reported in detail. In contrast to dispersed QDs, the photophysical properties of assembled QDs have not been revealed, although the structures of the self&#8208;assemblies are closely related to the device performance of the solid&#8208;state QDs. Therefore, creating and controlling the self&#8208;assembly of QDs into well&#8208;defined nanostructures is crucial but remains challenging. In this Minireview, we discuss the notable examples of assembled QDs such as dimers, trimers and extended QD assemblies achieved using organic templates. This Minireview should facilitate future advancements in materials science related to the assembled QDs.

      <title>Enhanced Operational Durability of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a Triazine Electron Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes were fabricated using an electron transport material (ETM) of pT2T. These devices had excellent operational durability, along with low driving voltages and high external quantum efficiencies, when compared with devices with a conventional ETM of T2T. This is because pT2T has higher electron mobility and excellent electrochemical stability than T2T has.







Abstract
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on materials that show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), the internal quantum efficiency of 100&#8201;% can be obtained without using phosphorescence&#8208;based organometallics that contain rare metals. Therefore, with TADF&#8208;based emitters, it is possible to fabricate high&#8208;performing OLEDs at a lower cost. However, compared with fluorescence&#8208; and phosphorescence&#8208;based OLEDs, an understanding of degradation mechanisms in TADF&#8208;based OLEDs is still insufficient for future commercialization. In particular, it is widely recognized that the development of electron transport materials is crucial for improving OLED characteristics, especially driving voltages and operational durability. In this study, it was demonstrated that the operational durability of TADF&#8208;based OLEDs was greatly improved by introducing a triazine&#8208;based material of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,3,5]triazine (pT2T) as a hole&#8208;blocking layer (HBL) compared with a conventional HBL material of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,3,5]triazine (T2T). Several experiments were carried out to make the reasons of the improved durability clearer, and attributed the improved durability to the shift of a carrier recombination zone from the emitting layer/HBL interface and the suppressed formation of excited&#8208;state quenchers in the pT2T HBL, because of the higher electron mobility of pT2T and the better stability of its radical anion state.

In this study, it was demonstrated that the operational durability of TADF&#8208;based OLEDs was greatly improved by introducing a triazine&#8208;based material of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,3,5]triazine (pT2T) as a hole&#8208;blocking layer (HBL) compared with a conventional HBL material of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,3,5]triazine (T2T). Several experiments were carried out to make the reasons of the improved durability clearer, and attributed the improved durability to the shift of a carrier recombination zone from the emitting layer/HBL interface and the suppressed formation of excited&#8208;state quenchers in the pT2T HBL, because of the higher electron mobility of pT2T and the better stability of its radical anion state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation by Ruthenium CNC Pincer Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction using a ruthenium photosensitizer, a sacrificial reagent, and a ruthenium catalyst were carried out. The catalysts contain a pincer ligand, 2,6&#8208;bis(alkylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)pyridine (CNC) and a bipyridine (bpy). The photocatalytic reaction system resulted in HCOOH as a main product (selectivity 70&#8211;80&#8201;%). The carbonyl catalyst with the smaller substituents (Me) reached a turnover number (TONHCOOH)=5634 (24&#8197;h).







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction using a ruthenium photosensitizer, a sacrificial reagent 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BI(OH)H), and a ruthenium catalyst were carried out. The catalysts contain a pincer ligand, 2,6&#8208;bis(alkylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)pyridine (CNC) and a bipyridine (bpy). The photocatalytic reaction system resulted in HCOOH as a main product (selectivity 70&#8211;80&#8201;%), with a small amount of CO, and H2. Comparative experiments (a coordinated ligand (NCMe vs. CO) and substituents (tBu vs. Me) of the CNC ligand in the catalyst) were performed. The turnover number (TONHCOOH) of carbonyl&#8208;ligated catalysts are higher than those of acetonitrile&#8208;ligated catalysts, and the carbonyl catalyst with the smaller substituents (Me) reached TONHCOOH=5634 (24&#8197;h), which is the best performance among the experiments.

      <title>Realization of an Asymmetric Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Battery through Molecular Design to Minimize Active Species Crossover and Decomposition</title>
      <dc:description>
Applied molecular design! This study presents a mechanism&#8208;based approach to the molecular design of electrolytes for implementation in an asymmetric non&#8208;aqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
This communication presents a mechanism&#8208;based approach to identify organic electrolytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). Symmetrical flow cell cycling of a pyridinium anolyte and a cyclopropenium catholyte resulted in extensive capacity fade due to competing decomposition of the pyridinium species. Characterization of this decomposition pathway enabled the rational design of next&#8208;generation anolyte/catholyte pairs with dramatically enhanced cycling performance. Three factors were identified as critical for slowing capacity fade: (1)&#8197;separating the anolyte&#8211;catholyte in an asymmetric flow cell using an anion exchange membrane (AEM); (2)&#8197;moving from monomeric to oligomeric electrolytes to limit crossover through the AEM; and (3)&#8197;removing the basic carbonyl moiety from the anolyte to slow the protonation&#8208;induced decomposition pathway. Ultimately, these modifications led to a novel anolyte&#8211;catholyte pair that can be cycled in an AEM&#8208;separated asymmetric RFB for 96&#8197;h with &gt;95&#8201;% capacity retention at an open circuit voltage of 1.57&#8197;V.

      <title>INPHARMA based determination of ligand binding modes at &#945;1&#8208;adrenergic receptors explains the molecular basis of subtype selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>The structural poses of ligands that bind weakly to protein receptors are challenging to define. In this work we have studied ligand interactions with the adrenoreceptor (AR) subtypes, &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR and &#945;  1B  &#8208;AR which belong to the G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily by employing the solution&#8208;based ligand&#8208;observed NMR method INPHARMA (Interligand Noes for PHARmacophore Mapping). Lack of receptor crystal structures and of subtype&#8208;selective drugs has hindered the definition of the physiological roles of each subtype and limited drug development. We determined the binding pose of the weak binding &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR selective agonist, A&#8208;61603, relative to an endogenous agonist, epinephrine, at both &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR and &#945;  1B  &#8208;AR. The NMR experimental data were quantitatively compared, using SpINPHARMA, to the back&#8208;calculated spectra based on ligand poses obtained from all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations. The results helped mechanistically explain the selectivity of (  R  )&#8208;A&#8208;61603 towards &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR, demonstrating an approach for targeting subtype selectivity in ARs.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;activated protein&#8208;conjugation and 89Zr&#8208;radiolabelling with water&#8208;soluble desferrioxamine derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;conjugates are vital tools in biomedical research, drug discovery and imaging science. For example, functionalised monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) coupled to the desferrioxamine B (DFO) chelate and radiolabelled with 89Zr are used as radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET). In this context, protein functionalisation requires the formation of a covalent bond which must be achieved without compromising the biological properties of the mAb. Photochemistry offers new synthetic routes toward protein&#8208;conjugates like 89Zr&#8208;mAbs but to harness the potential of light&#8208;induced conjugation reactions new photoactivatable reagents are required. Here, we introduce two photoactivatable DFO&#8208;derivatives functionalised with an aryl azide (ArN3) for use in light&#8208;activated conjugation and radiosynthesis of 89Zr&#8208;mAbs. Incorporation of a tris&#8208;polyethylene glycol (PEG)3 linker between DFO and the ArN3 group furnished water&#8208;soluble chelates that were used in the one&#8208;pot, photoradiosynthesis of different 89Zr&#8208;radiolabelled protein&#8208;conjugates with radiochemical yields up to 72.9&#177;1.9%. Notably, the DFO&#8208;PEG3 chelates can be readily synthesised in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), which will facilitate clinical trials with photoradiolabelled 89Zr&#8208;mAbs.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphine functionalized &#223;&#8208;diketimine ligand for the synthesis of manifold metal complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A bis(diphenyl)&#8208;phosphine functionalized  &#223;  &#8208;diketimine (PNac&#8209;H) was synthesized as a flexible ligand for transition metal complexes. The newly designed ligand features symmetrically placed phosphine moieties around a  &#223;  &#8208;diketimine unit, forming a PNNP&#8208;type pocket. Due to the orthogonal donor atoms (N vs. P) the ligand can stabilize various coordination polyhedra. A complete series ranging from coordination numbers 2 to 6 was realized. Linear, trigonal planar, square planar, tetrahedral, square pyramidal, and octahedral coordination arrangements containing the PNac&#8208;ligand around the metal center were observed by using suitable metal sources. Hereby, PNac&#8209;H or its anion PNac  &#8211;  acts as mono&#8208;, bi&#8208; and tetradendate ligand. Such a broad flexibility is unusual for a rigid tetradentate system. The structural motifs were realized by treatment of PNac&#8209;H with a series of late transition metal precursors, e.g. silver, gold, nickel, copper, platinum, and rhodium. The new complexes have been fully characterized by single crystal X&#8209;ray diffraction, NMR, IR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, selected complexes were investigated regarding their photophysical properties. Thus, PNac&#8209;H proved to be an ideal ligand platform for the selective coordination and stabilization of various metal ions in diverse polyhedra and oxidation states.</dc:description>

      <title>Systematic DFT Studies on Binary Pseudo&#8208;Tetrahedral Zintl Anions: Relative Stabilities and Reactivities Towards Protons, Trimethylsilyl Groups, and Iron Complex Fragments</title>
      <dc:description>Binary  pseudo  &#8208;tetrahedral  Zintl  anions composed of (semi&#8208;)metal atoms of the p&#8208;block elements have proven to be excellent starting materials for the synthesis of a variety of heterometallic and intermetalloid transition metal&#8722;main group metal cluster anions. However, only 11 of the theoretically possible 48 anions have been experimentally accessed to date as isolable salts. This brings up the question, whether the other species are generally not achievable, or whether synthetic chemists just did not succeed in their preparation so far. To contribute to a possible answer to this question, we calculated global minimum structures for all anions of the type (TrTt  3  )  5  &#8722;  , (TrPn  3  )  2&#8722;  , and (Tt  2  Pn  2  )  2&#8722;  , comprising elements of periods 3 to 6 (Tr: triel, Al&#183;&#183;&#183;Tl; Tt: tetrel, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb; Pn: pnictogen, P&#183;&#183;&#183;Bi). By analyzing the computational results, we developed a concept to predict which of the yet missing anions should be synthesizable and why. Additionally, we describe molecular structures that would result upon electrophilic attack by protons or trimethylsilyl groups, or upon nucleophilic attack by transition metal complex fragments. The latter yields butterfly&#8208;like structures that can be viewed as a new form of adaptable tridentate chelating ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrophoretic Deposition of Binder&#8208;Free MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Films for High&#8208;Performance Microsupercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, miniaturized power supplies have become essential components of micro&#8208;electromechanical systems (MEMS) and micro portable microdevices due to their high&#8208;power density, moderate specific energy, and superior long&#8208;term cyclability. In this study, we successfully fabricate microsupercapacitors with ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbons as active materials  via  electrophoretic deposition method. The carbon materials on microsupercapacitors, which are directly deposited or obtained by pyrolyzing pre&#8208;deposited ZIF&#8208;8 particles, play a crucial role in achieving outstanding electrochemical performances.

The simple and facile process of electrophoretic deposition and subsequent pyrolysis of ZIF&#8208;8 particles generates a film of densely populated microporous carbon particles on microsupercapacitor, leading to superior capacitive performances.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, miniaturized power supplies have become essential components of micro&#8208;electromechanical systems (MEMS) and micro portable microdevices due to their high&#8208;power density, moderate specific energy, and superior long&#8208;term cyclability. In this study, we successfully fabricate microsupercapacitors with ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbons as active materials  via  electrophoretic deposition method. The carbon materials on microsupercapacitors, which are directly deposited or obtained by pyrolyzing pre&#8208;deposited ZIF&#8208;8 particles, play a crucial role in achieving outstanding electrochemical performances.

      <title>Direct Measurement of the Visible to UV Photodissociation Processes for the PhotoCORM TryptoCORM</title>
      <dc:description>PhotoCORMs are light&#8208;triggered compounds that release CO for medical applications. Here, we apply laser spectroscopy in the gas phase to TryptoCORM, a known photoCORM that has been shown to destroy  Escherichia coli  upon visible&#8208;light activation. Our experiments allow us to map TryptoCORM&#8217;s photochemistry across a wide wavelength range by using novel laser&#8208;interfaced mass spectrometry (LIMS). LIMS provides the intrinsic absorption spectrum of the photoCORM along with the production spectra of all of its ionic photoproducts for the first time. Importantly, the photoproduct spectra directly reveal the optimum wavelengths for maximizing CO ejection, and the extent to which CO ejection is compromised at redder wavelengths. A series of comparative studies were performed on TryptoCORM&#8208;CH  3  CN which exists in dynamic equilibrium with TryptoCORM in solution. Our measurements allow us to conclude that the presence of the labile CH  3  CN facilitates CO release over a wider wavelength range. This work demonstrates the potential of LIMS as a new methodology for assessing active agent release (  e.g.  CO, NO, H  2  S) from light&#8208;activated prodrugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Effects of Amino Group Substitution on the&#160;Photophysical Properties and Stability of&#160;Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent P&#8208;Rhodamines</title>
      <dc:description>A series of phosphine oxide&#8208;bridged rhodamines (P&#8208;rhodamines) bearing various acyclic and cyclic amine moieties, including dimethyl&#8208; and diethylamine, azetidine, pyrrolidine and 7&#8208;azabicyclo[2,2,1]heptane (7ABH), has been synthesized. Photophysical properties as well as chemical and photo&#8208;stability of these dyes have been studied in detail. Among these dyes, 7ABH&#8208;substituted dye shows stronger fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, relative to the other P&#8208;rhodamines. This dye can be applied to live&#8208;cell imaging, where lysosomes were selectively stained in a pH&#8208;independent manner. It was also found that the ring fusion of the amine moieties gives rise to remarkably red&#8208;shifted spectra with the absorption and emission maxima at 770 and 820 nm, respectively, spectrally close to that of indocyanine green (ICG).

      <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Propargylic Substitution Reaction of Racemic Secondary Propargylic Alcohols with Thiols</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the significant progress of the enantioselective reaction using chiral catalysts, the enantioselective nucleophilic substitution reaction at the chiral sp 3 &#8208;hybridized carbon atom of a racemic electrophile has not been largely explored. Here, we report the enantioconvergent propargylic substitution reaction of racemic propargylic alcohols with thiols using chiral bis&#8208;phosphoric acid as the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst. The substitution products were formed in high yields with high enantioselectivities in most cases. The cation&#8208;stabilizing effect of the sulfur functional group introduced at the alkynyl terminus is the key to achieving the efficient enantioconvergent process, in which chiral information originating from not only the racemic stereogenic center but also the formed contact ion pair is completely eliminated from the present system.</dc:description>

Here, we report the enantioconvergent propargylic substitution reaction of racemic propargylic alcohols with thiols using chiral bis&#8208;phosphoric acid as the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst. The substitution products were formed in high yields with high enantioselectivities in most cases. The cation&#8208;stabilizing effect of the sulfur functional group introduced at the alkynyl terminus is the key to achieving the efficient enantioconvergent process, in which chiral information originating from not only the racemic stereogenic center but also the formed contact ion pair is completely eliminated from the present system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Comparative solution synthesis of Mn doped (Na,K)NbO3 thin films</title>
      <dc:description>(K  0.5  Na  0.5  )NbO  3  &#160;(KNN) is a promising lead&#8208;free alternative for ferroelectric thin films such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O  3  .

This paper compares three acetate&#8208;based chemical solution synthesis and deposition methods for 0.5 mol% Mn doped KNN film fabrication, using lower crystallization temperature processes in comparison to sintering temperatures necessary for fabrication of KNN ceramics. This paper shows the crucial role of the A site homogenization step during solution synthesis in preserving alkali chemical homogeneity of Mn&#8208;doped KNN films. Chemically homogeneous films show uniform grain size of 80 nm and leakage current density under 2.8 x 10  &#8208;8  A/cm  2  &#160;up to electric fields as high as 600 kV/cm, which is the highest breakdown strength reported for KNN thin films. Solution synthesis involving two&#8208;step pyrolysis resulted in films with dense, columnar microstructures, which are interesting for orientation control and enhancement of piezoelectric properties.

      <title>The &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dihalocarbonyl Building Blocks: An Avenue for New Reaction Development in Organic Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Versatile building blocks: A summary of the novel and non&#8208;classical synthetic transformations discovered by exploring the novel reactivity of the versatile 1,2&#8208;bifunctional building blocks &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones, for organic synthesis is presented in this Review. It also provides a survey of existing synthetic methods for these building blocks.







Abstract
The &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihalocarbonyl moiety is a bifunctional system with a gem&#8208;dihalocarbon and a carbonyl carbon in 1,2&#8208;fashion. This is one of the privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry due to its chemical and metabolic stability and lipophilicity. They have also been found in numerous structurally divergent natural products and most of their fabricated structures have already been in medicinal use. Apart from their important use in medicinal chemistry, the &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihalocarbonyl groups have been employed as key building blocks for the development of novel synthetic strategies and utilized as intermediates in total synthesis. In addition to the traditional transformations such as oxidations, reductions, and C&#8722;C bond formations, recently several new and non&#8208;classical reactions have also been developed. This review provides short description of existing methods for their synthesis and detailed discussion on the efforts for the discovery and development of new reactions by employing &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones as synthetic building blocks. We have presented their use as key functional groups for the synthesis of polycyclic systems of medicinal and material importance and natural products.

      <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing the N6&#8208;(2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;erythropentofuranosyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (Fapy&#8901;dG) Oxidative Damage Product Derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxyguanosine</title>
      <dc:description>
Biochemical, cellular and structural studies on Fapy&#8901;dG have been hampered due to difficulties in synthesizing oligonucleotides containing this lesion. A robust method for synthesizing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&#8901;dG is reported that will greatly facilitate investigations on the biological and structural effects of Fapy&#8901;dG (see scheme).







Abstract
N6&#8208;(2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;erythropentofuranosyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (Fapy&#8901;dG) is a major DNA lesion produced from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine under oxidizing conditions. Fapy&#8901;dG is produced from a common intermediate that leads to 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (8&#8208;OxodGuo), and in greater quantities in cells. The impact of Fapy&#8901;dG on DNA structure and function is much less well understood than that of 8&#8208;OxodGuo. This is largely due to the significantly greater difficulty in synthesizing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&#8901;dG than 8&#8208;OxodGuo. We describe a synthetic approach for preparing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&#8901;dG that will facilitate intensive studies of this lesion in DNA. A variety of oligonucleotides as long as 30&#8197;nucleotides are synthesized. We anticipate that the chemistry described herein will provide an impetus for a wide range of studies involving Fapy&#8901;dG.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biochemical&lt;/b&gt;, cellular and structural studies on Fapy&#8901;dG have been hampered due to difficulties in synthesizing oligonucleotides containing this lesion. A robust method for synthesizing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&#8901;dG is reported that will greatly facilitate investigations on the biological and structural effects of Fapy&#8901;dG (see scheme).

Fapy&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;dG is produced from a common intermediate that leads to 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (8&#8208;OxodGuo), and in greater quantities in cells. The impact of Fapy&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;dG on DNA structure and function is much less well understood than that of 8&#8208;OxodGuo. This is largely due to the significantly greater difficulty in synthesizing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;dG than 8&#8208;OxodGuo. We describe a synthetic approach for preparing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;dG that will facilitate intensive studies of this lesion in DNA. A variety of oligonucleotides as long as 30&#8197;nucleotides are synthesized. We anticipate that the chemistry described herein will provide an impetus for a wide range of studies involving Fapy&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;dG.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Triple Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Type Reactivity on a Single Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Center</title>
      <dc:description>
Ce/P FLP: The first Ce/P frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) system was synthesized by the reaction of heptadentate N4P3 ligand with Ce[N(TMS)2]3. This Ce/P species exhibits triple FLP&#8208;type reactivity towards a series of heteroallenes, including isocyanates, isothiocyanates, diazomethane, and organic azides under mild conditions.







Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth metal cations have been used rarely as Lewis&#8208;acidic components in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). Herein, we report the first cerium/phosphorus system (2) employing a heptadentate N4P3 ligand, which exhibits triple FLP&#8208;type reactivity towards a series of organic substrates, including isocyanates, isothiocyanates, diazomethane, and azides on a single rare&#8208;earth Lewis acidic Ce center. This result shows that the Ce center and three P atoms in 2 could simultaneously activate three equivalents of small molecules under mild conditions. This study broadens the diversity of FLPs and demonstrates that rare earth based FLP exhibit unique properties compared with other FLP systems.

      <title>N&#8208;Doped Graphdiyne Coating for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY) is used to improve the nucleation and plating process of metallic Li on the Cu substrate. With the lithiophilic nanofilms, the NGDY@Cu nanowire (NW) electrode exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and significant improvements in terms of coulombic efficiency and lifespan.







Abstract
Nonuniform nucleation is one of the major reasons for the dendric growth of metallic lithium, which leads to intractable problems in the efficiency, reversibility, and safety in Li&#8208;based batteries. To improve the deposition of metallic Li on Cu substrates, herein, a freestanding current collector (NGDY@CuNW) is formed by coating pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY) nanofilms on 3D Cu nanowires (CuNWs). Theoretical predictions reveal that the introduction of nitrogen atoms in the 2D GDY can enhance the binding energy between the Li atom and GDY, therefore improving the lithiophilicity on the surface for uniform lithium nucleation and deposition. Accordingly, the deposited metallic Li on the NGDY@CuNW electrode exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology, resulting in significant improvements in terms of the reversibility with a high coulombic efficiency (CE) and a long lifespan at high current density. Our research provides an efficient method to control the surface property of Cu, which also will be instructive for other metal batteries.

      <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I)&#8211;Aryl Complexes: Expanded Scope and Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>

The scalability of the synthetic methods, in combination with a diversity of reactivity, sets the stage for the use of these complexes in catalytic and synthetic applications (see scheme).







Abstract
The discovery of sustainable and scalable synthetic protocols leading to gold&#8211;aryl compounds bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands sparked an investigation of their reactivity and potential utility as organometallic synthons. The use of a mild base and green solvents provide access to these compounds, starting from widely available boronic acids and various [Au(NHC)Cl] complexes, with reactions taking place under air, at room temperature and leading to high yields with unprecedented ease. One compound, (N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)gold, ([Au(IPr)(4&#8208;MeOC6H4)]), was synthesized on a multigram scale and used to gauge the reactivity of this class of compounds towards C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bonds and with various acids, revealing simple pathways to gold&#8211;based species that possess attractive properties as materials, reagents and/or catalysts.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions with Cp*MIII catalysts (M=Co, Rh, Ir) have found a wide variety of applications in organic synthesis. Albeit the intrinsic difficulties in achieving catalytic stereocontrol using these catalysts due to their lack of additional coordination sites for external chiral ligands and the conformational flexibility of the Cp ligand, catalytic enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using the Group&#8197;9 metal triad with Cp&#8208;type ligands have been intensively studied since 2012. In this minireview, the progress in these reactions according to the type of the chiral catalyst used are summarized and discussed.

The hydrophobic block of the copolymer is a random copolymer consisting of a spiropyran functionalized 2&#8208;oxazoline (SPOx) and 2&#8208;(but&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazole (ButynOx), while the hydrophilic block is based on 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (MeOx). The block copolymer is terminated with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl) amine (TREN) that serves as catalyst in a Knoevenagel condensation. Four block copolymers with different ButynOx/SPOx and hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios are synthesized and self&#8208;assembled through solvent exchange. Micelles and vesicles of various sizes are observed by TEM, which undergo morphological and size changes in response to irradiation with UV light. We hypothesize that these transformations in the nanostructures are caused by increases in the hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic block when spiropyran (SP) isomerizes to merocyanine (MC) in the presence of UV light. The reversible transition from micellar to vesicular nanoreactors resulted in increased reaction kinetics through improved substrate accessibility to the catalytic site, or termination of the catalytic reaction due to polymer precipitation. These nanoreactors present a promising platform towards photoregulating reaction outcomes based on changes in nanostructure morphology.</dc:description>

      <title>Free&#8208;standing black phosphorus foils for energy storage and catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (BP) is a two&#8208;dimensional material that has attracted intensive attention for application in energy storage and catalysis due to its large surface area, and good electrical and thermal conductivity. Herein we demonstrate a comparable study of black phosphorus electrochemical exfoliation in various anion medium of tetrabutylammonium salts (TBAX, where X is &#8208;PF6, &#8208;BF4, &#8208;ClO4) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Based on the morphological and structural analysis we show that the TBAPF6/DMSO medium was specifically appropriate for the production of high&#8208;quality BP nanosheets with micrometer lateral size and thickness of about ~2.4 nm. TBAPF6/DMSO&#8208;processed few&#8208;layer BP exhibits enhanced HER catalytic activity compared with samples exfoliated with the assistance of BF4&#8208; and ClO4&#8208; ions. Finally, we demonstrate the fabrication process of flexible free&#8208;standing BP films and further their performance in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor device.</dc:description>

      <title>Vanadium&#8208;manganese redox flow battery: Study of Mn(III) disproportionation in the presence of other metallic ions.</title>
      <dc:description>The Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox couple with a standard potential of +1.51 V  vs  . SHE has drawn interest for the design of V/Mn redox flow battery (RFB). However, Mn(III) disproportionation leads to a loss of capacity, an increase of pressure drop and electrode passivation due to the formation of MnO  2  during battery cycling. In this work, we studied the influence of Ti(IV) or/and V(V) on Mn(III) stability in acidic conditions, by formulating 4 different electrolytes at equimolar ratios (Mn, Mn:Ti, Mn:V, Mn:V:Ti). Voltammetric studies have revealed a EC  i  process for Mn(II) oxidation responsible for the electrode passivation. SEM and XPS analysis demonstrate that the nature and the morphology of the passivating oxides layer strongly rely on the electrolyte composition. Spectroelectrochemistry highlights the stabilization effect of Ti(IV) and V(V) on Mn(III). At a comparable pH, the amount of Mn(III) losses through disproportionation is decreased by a factor of 2.5 in the presence of Ti(IV) or/and V(V). V(V) is an efficient substitute to Ti(IV) in order to stabilize Mn(III) electrolyte for redox flow battery applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Perovskite Oxides Prepared by Hydrothermal and Solvothermal Synthesis: a Review of Crystallisation, Chemistry, and Compositions</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite oxides with general composition ABO3 are a large group of inorganic materials that can contain a variety of cations from all parts of the Periodic Table and that have diverse properties of application in fields ranging from electronics, energy storage to photocatalysis. Solvothermal synthesis routes to these materials have become increasingly investigated in the past decade as a means of direct crystallisation of the solids from solution. These methods have significant advantages leading to adjustment of crystal form from the nanoscale to the micron&#8208;scale, the isolation of compositions not possible using conventional solid&#8208;state synthesis and in addition may lead to scalable processes for producing materials at moderate temperatures. These aspects are reviewed, with examples taken from the past decade&#8217;s literature on the solvothermal synthesis of perovskites with a systematic survey of B&#8208;site cations, from transition metals in Groups 4&#8208;8 and main group elements in Groups 13, 14 and 15, to solid solutions and heterostructures. As well as hydrothermal reactions, the use of various solvents and solution additives are discussed and some trends identified, along with prospects for developing control and predictability in the crystallisation of complex oxide materials.</dc:description>

Reaction conditions for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions are mild and functional group&#8208;tolerant, and therefore these protocols allow to construct the polyene structures using shorter unsaturated reactants with the desired geometries, since in general the products preserve the stereochemical information of the connected cross&#8208;coupling partners.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct, Enantioselective, and Nickel(II) Catalyzed Reactions of N&#8208;Azidoacetyl Thioimides with Trimethyl Orthoformate. A New Combined Methodology for the Rapid Synthesis of Lacosamide and Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>A direct and highly enantioselective reaction of  N  &#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione with trimethyl orthoformate catalyzed by Tol&#8208;BINAPNiCl  2  in the presence of TESOTf and 2,6&#8208;lutidine is reported. The heterocyclic scaffold can be easily removed by addition of a wide array of amines to give the corresponding enantiomerically pure 2&#8208;azido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethoxypropanamides in high yields. Appropriate manipulation of the  N  &#8208;benzyl amide derivative provides a quick and efficient access to the antiepileptic agent lacosamide through a new enantioselective C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming process. DFT&#8208;Computational studies uncover clues for the understanding of the remarkable stereocontrol of the addition of a nickel(II) enolate to a putative oxocarbenium intermediate from trimethyl orthoformate.</dc:description>

The heterocyclic scaffold can be easily removed by addition of a wide array of amines to give the corresponding enantiomerically pure 2&#8208;azido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethoxypropanamides in high yields. Appropriate manipulation of the  N  &#8208;benzyl amide derivative provides a quick and efficient access to the antiepileptic agent lacosamide through a new enantioselective C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming process. DFT&#8208;Computational studies uncover clues for the understanding of the remarkable stereocontrol of the addition of a nickel(II) enolate to a putative oxocarbenium intermediate from trimethyl orthoformate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Distance Matters: Effect of the Spacer Length on the Photophysical Properties of Multimodular Perylenediimide&#8211;Silicon Phthalocyanine&#8211;Fullerene Triads</title>

Light&#8208;induced events: Excited state energy transfer leading to 1SiPc*, and electron transfer leading to PDI.&#8722;&#8208;SiPc.+&#8208;C60 charge separated state, in a newly synthesized covalently linked triad featuring C60 and perylene diimide connected at the opposite ends of axial positions of a SiPc, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor conjugate featuring silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) as the electron donor, and two electron acceptors, namely tetrachloroperylenediimide (PDI) and C60, placed at the opposite ends of the SiPc axial positions, was newly designed and synthesized, and the results were compared to the earlier reported PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. Minimal intramolecular interactions between the entities was observed. Absorption, fluorescence, computational and electrochemical studies were performed to evaluate the excitation energy, geometry and electronic structure, and energy levels of different photoevents. Steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence and excitation spectral studies revealed efficient singlet&#8211;singlet energy transfer from 1PDI* to SiPc in the PDI&#8208;SiPc dyad and the PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. The measured rates for these photochemical events were found to be much higher than those reported earlier for the triad, due to closer proximity between the PDI and SiPc entities. The distance also affected the charge separation path in which involvement of PDI, and not C60, in charge separation in the present triad was witnessed. The present investigation brings out the importance of donor&#8211;acceptor distances in channeling photochemical events in a multimodular system.

      <title>A Path to More Sustainable Catalysis: The Critical Role of LiBr in Avoiding Catalyst Death and its Impact on Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst death&#8230;.&#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is the poison, but LiBr is the cure! During the cross&#8208;coupling of alkylzincs to aryl electrophiles, Pd N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination followed by reductive elimination and aryl&#8208;reductive elimination to create the corresponding NHC&#8208;H or NHC&#8208;aryl salts, with the former being kinetically faster. The use of LiBr curtails this form of catalyst death and allows for dramatically higher turnover numbers (see scheme).







Abstract
The role that LiBr plays in the lifetime of Pd&#8208;NHC complexes has been investigated. A bromide ion is proposed to coordinate to Pd thereby preventing beta hydride elimination (BHE) (to form NHC&#8208;H+) of the reductive elimination (RE) intermediate that normally completes with the desired cross&#8208;coupling catalytic cycle. Coordinating groups, such as anilines, are able to bind suitably well to Pd to prevent this pathway from occurring, thus reducing the need for the added salt. The metal hydride formed from BHE is very unstable and RE of the hydride to the NHC ligand occurs very rapidly giving rise to the corresponding hydrido&#8208;NHC (i.e., NHC&#8208;H+). The use of the per deuterated dibutylzinc shows a significant deuterium isotope effect, shutting down catalyst death almost completely. The use of bis&#8208;neopentylzinc, now possessing no hydrides, eliminates catalyst death all together leading to a very long&#8208;lived catalytic cycle and confirming the untoward role of BHE.

      <title>Hollow 3D Frame Structure Modified with NiCo2S4 Nanosheets and Spinous Fe2O3 Nanowires as Electrode Materials for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid construction: A 3D asymmetric supercapacitor system constructed from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and nanospinous Fe2O3 on hollow melamine foam/polypyrrole (MF/PPY) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, is reported. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an extended operation voltage window and good cycling stability (see figure).







Abstract
Supercapacitors have attracted tremendous research interest, since they are expected to achieve battery&#8208;level energy density, while having a long calendar life and short charging time. Herein, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor has been successfully assembled from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and spinous Fe2O3 nanowire modified hollow melamine foam decorated with polypyrrole as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Owing to the well&#8208;designed nanostructure and suitable matching of electrode materials, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibits an extended operation voltage window of 1.6&#8197;V with an energy density of 20.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 159.4&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the ASC shows stable cycling stability, with 81.3&#8201;% retention after 4000&#8197;cycles and a low internal resistance of 1.03&#8197;&#937;. Additionally, a 2.5&#8197;V light&#8208;emitting diode indicator can be lit up by three ASCs connected in series; this provides evidence of the practical application potential of the assembled energy&#8208;storage system. The excellent electrochemical performances should be credited to the significant enhancement of the specific surface area, charge transport, and mechanical stability resulting from the unique 3D morphology.

      <title>Manipulation of the Coordination Geometry along the C4 Rotation Axis in a Dinuclear Tb3+ Triple&#8208;Decker Complex via a Supramolecular Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Switchable SMMs: The magnetic relaxation behavior of a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) could be controlled by selectively changing the coordination environment in the neutral state using a supramolecular approach. By controlling the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 axis in the Tb&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes, switchable SMMs are possible.







Abstract
A supramolecular complex (1&#8901;C60) was prepared by assembling (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) with the dinuclear Tb3+ triple&#8208;decker complex [(TPP)Tb(Pc)Tb(TPP)] (1: Tb3+=trivalent terbium ion, Pc2&#8722;=phthalocyaninato, TPP2&#8722;=tetraphenylporphyrinato) with quasi&#8208;D4h symmetry to investigate the relationship between the coordination symmetry and single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) properties. Tb3+&#8208;Pc triple&#8208;decker complexes (Tb2Pc3) have an important advantage over Tb3+&#8208;Pc double&#8208;decker complexes (TbPc2) since the magnetic relaxation processes correspond to the Zeeman splitting when there are two 4f spin systems. The two Tb3+ sites of 1 are equivalent, and the twist angle (&#966;) was determined to be 3.62&#176;. On the other hand, the two Tb3+ sites of 1&#8901;C60 are not equivalent. The &#966; values for sites Tb1 and Tb2 were determined to be 3.67&#176; and 33.8&#176;, respectively, due to a change in the coordination symmetry of 1 upon association with C60. At 1.8&#8197;K, 1 and 1&#8901;C60 undergo different magnetic relaxations, and the changes in the ground state affect the spin dynamics. Although 1 and 1&#8901;C60 relax via QTM in a zero applied magnetic field (H), H dependencies of the magnetic relaxation times (&#964;) for H&gt;1500&#8197;Oe are similar. On the other hand, for H&lt;1500&#8197;Oe, the &#964; values have different behaviors since the off&#8208;diagonal terms (
) affect the magnetic relaxation mechanism. From temperature (T) and H dependences of &#964;, spin&#8208;phonon interactions along with direct and Raman mechanisms explain the spin dynamics. We believe that a supramolecular method can be used to control the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 rotation axis and the spin dynamic properties in dinuclear Ln3+&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes.

On the other hand, the two Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites of &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; are not equivalent. The &lt;i&gt;&#966;&lt;/i&gt; values for sites Tb1 and Tb2 were determined to be 3.67&#176; and 33.8&#176;, respectively, due to a change in the coordination symmetry of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; upon association with C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. At 1.8&#8197;K, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; undergo different magnetic relaxations, and the changes in the ground state affect the spin dynamics. Although &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; relax via QTM in a zero applied magnetic field (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; dependencies of the magnetic relaxation times (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;) for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;1500&#8197;Oe are similar. On the other hand, for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1500&#8197;Oe, the &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; values have different behaviors since the off&#8208;diagonal terms (
) affect the magnetic relaxation mechanism. From temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; dependences of &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;, spin&#8208;phonon interactions along with direct and Raman mechanisms explain the spin dynamics. We believe that a supramolecular method can be used to control the magnetic anisotropy along the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotation axis and the spin dynamic properties in dinuclear Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elucidating the Structural Chemistry of a Hysteretic Iron(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Compound From its Copper(II) and Zinc(II) Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>
In a spin: Structurally different [ML2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (L=2,6&#8208;bis[5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]&#8208;pyridine; M=Fe, Cu or Zn) form the same anhydrous phase on annealing, which transforms to one of two new phases near room temperature. [ZnL2][BF4]2 shows unusual structural changes between 285&#8211;150&#8197;K, which are duplicated in its iron analogue by powder diffraction. This will contribute to the previously reported 65&#8197;K thermal hysteresis in the spin&#8208;transition shown by [FeL2][BF4]2.







Abstract
Annealing [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (L=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]pyridine) affords an anhydrous material, which undergoes a spin transition at T1/2=205&#8197;K with a 65&#8197;K thermal hysteresis loop. This occurs through a sequence of phase changes, which were monitored by powder diffraction in an earlier study. [CuL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O and [ZnL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O are not perfectly isostructural but, unlike the iron compound, they undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal dehydration upon annealing. All the annealed compounds initially adopt the same tetragonal phase but undergo a phase change near room temperature upon re&#8208;cooling. The low&#8208;temperature phase of [CuL2][BF4]2 involves ordering of its Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, to a monoclinic lattice with three unique cation sites. The zinc compound adopts a different, triclinic low&#8208;temperature phase with significant twisting of its coordination sphere, which unexpectedly becomes more pronounced as the crystal is cooled. Synchrotron powder diffraction data confirm that the structural changes in the anhydrous zinc complex are reproduced in the high&#8208;spin iron compound, before the onset of spin&#8208;crossover. This will contribute to the wide hysteresis in the spin transition of the iron complex. EPR spectra of copper&#8208;doped [Fe0.97Cu0.03L2][BF4]2 imply its low&#8208;spin phase contains two distinct cation environments in a 2:1 ratio.

      <title>Towards the Sarpagine&#8208;Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Family of Indole Alkaloids: Enantioselective Synthesis of an N&#8208;Demethyl Alstolactone Diastereomer</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic methods: Transannular cyclization is a key step for the formation of azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a common structural motif found in the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of natural products (see scheme).







Abstract
the strategy involving the use of functionalized tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;cycloocta[b]indol&#8208;6&#8208;one is reported as a key intermediate for synthesis of members of the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The desired tricycle was synthesized through the following key steps: 1)&#8197;Evans&#8217; syn&#8208;selective aldolization; 2)&#8197;Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl cross&#8208;coupling using the phenylthiol ester of 3&#8208;chloropropanoic acid as a surrogate of acrylic thioester for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles; and 3)&#8197;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) for the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring. An N&#8208;allylation followed by intramolecular 1,4&#8208;addition was planned for synthesis of the vobasine class of natural products. However, attempted cyclizations under a diverse set of conditions involving anionic, radical, and organopalladium/organonickel species failed to produce the bridged ring system. On the other hand, esterification of the pendant primary alcohol function with acetoacetic acid, followed by intramolecular Michael addition, afforded the desired tetracycle with excellent diastereoselectivity. Subsequent functional group manipulation and transannular cyclization of the amino alcohol afforded the N(1)&#8208;demethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;alstolactone. We believe that the same synthetic route would afford the alstolactone should the amino alcohol with appropriate stereochemistry be used as the starting material.

      <title>Molecular Engineering of Isomeric Benzofurocarbazole Donors for Photophysical Management of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning delayed fluorescence: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.







Abstract
Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, only 5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (34BFCz) has been reported and, to the best of our knowledge, no other benzofurocarbazole derivatives have been covered in the literature. In the present study, two further benzofurocarbazole moieties, 12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (12BFCz) and 7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (23BFCz), have been synthesized to investigate the effect of the donor structure on the photophysics and device parameters of TADF emitters. Two benzofurocarbazole&#8208;derived TADF emitters, 12&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (o12BFCzTrz) and 7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (o23BFCzTrz), have been compared with 5&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (oBFCzTrz). The benzofurocarbazole donor structure governs the TADF characteristics, such as charge&#8208;transfer property and emission color. The 12BFCz donor has proved to be effective in blue&#8208;shifting the emission color, and 34BFCz has proven useful for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The 12BFCz&#8208;derived o12BFCzTrz showed blue&#8208;shifted color coordinates of (0.159, 0.288), compared to (0.178, 0388) for o23BFCzTrz and (0.169, 0.341) for oBFCzTrz. The 34BFCz&#8208;derived oBFCzTrz exhibited an EQE of 22.9&#8201;%, compared to 19.2&#8201;% for o12BFCzTrz and 21.1&#8201;% for o23BFCzTrz.

Two benzofurocarbazole&#8208;derived TADF emitters, 12&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;12&#8201;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]carbazole (o12BFCzTrz) and 7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;7&#8201;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]carbazole (o23BFCzTrz), have been compared with 5&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;5&#8201;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]carbazole (oBFCzTrz). The benzofurocarbazole donor structure governs the TADF characteristics, such as charge&#8208;transfer property and emission color. The 12BFCz donor has proved to be effective in blue&#8208;shifting the emission color, and 34BFCz has proven useful for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The 12BFCz&#8208;derived o12BFCzTrz showed blue&#8208;shifted color coordinates of (0.159, 0.288), compared to (0.178, 0388) for o23BFCzTrz and (0.169, 0.341) for oBFCzTrz. The 34BFCz&#8208;derived oBFCzTrz exhibited an EQE of 22.9&#8201;%, compared to 19.2&#8201;% for o12BFCzTrz and 21.1&#8201;% for o23BFCzTrz.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of Axial Ligands on Easy&#8208;Axis Anisotropy and Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Heptacoordinated FeII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic anisotropy in FeII complexes: Three new heptacoordinated FeII complexes of the general formulae [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The magnitude of the easy&#8208;axis anisotropy of complex 3 is larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to weak d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; interactions between the &#960; orbitals of the metal and the axial donor ligands.







Abstract
A rational approach to modulating easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy by varying the axial donor ligand in heptacoordinated FeII complexes has been explored. In this series of complexes with formulae of [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) [H4L=2,2&#8242;&#8208;{pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylbis(ethan&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)}bis(N&#8208;phenylhydrazinecarboxamide)], the axial positions are successively occupied by different nitrogen&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;donor ligands. Detailed dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal the existence of easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy for all of the complexes, with 1 [Ueff=21&#8197;K, &#964;0=1.72&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] and 2 [Ueff=25&#8197;K, &#964;0=2.25&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] showing field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior. However, both experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate the magnitude of the D value of complex 3 to be larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to the axial bond angle being smaller than that for an ideal geometry. Detailed analysis of the field and temperature dependences of relaxation time for 1 and 2 has revealed that multiple relaxation processes (quantum tunneling of magnetization, direct, and Raman) are involved in slow magnetic relaxation for both of these complexes. Magnetic dilution experiments support the role of intermolecular short contacts.

      <title>Anion Recognition by Neutral Chalcogen Bonding Receptors: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations</title>
      <dc:description>
Chalcogen binding motifs: The synthesis of three new families of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium&#8208;based chalcogen binding (ChB) motifs is reported. The stability of the chalcophene binding motifs has enabled the determination of the association constants for ChB halide anion binding in the polar aprotic solvent THF by 1H, 77Se, and 125Te&#8197;NMR experiments.







Abstract
The utilization of neutral receptors for the molecular recognition of anions based on chalcogen bonding (ChB) is an undeveloped area of host&#8208;guest chemistry. In this manuscript, the synthesis of two new families of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium&#8208;based ChB binding motifs are reported. The stability of the thiophene, selenophene, and tellurophene binding motifs has enabled the determination of the association constants for ChB halide anion binding in the polar aprotic solvent THF by 1H, 77Se, and 125Te&#8197;NMR experiments. Two different aromatic cores are used and one or two Ch&#8208;binding motifs are incorporated with the purpose of encapsulating the anion, offering up to two concurrent chalcogen bonds. Theoretical calculations and NMR experiments reveal that, for S and Se receptors, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions involving the acidic H atom adjacent to the chalcogen atom are energetically favored over the ChB interaction. However, for the tellurophene binding motif, the &#963;&#8208;hole interaction is competitive and more favored than the hydrogen bond.

      <title>Efficiency of Site&#8208;Specific Clicked Laccase&#8211;Carbon Nanotubes Biocathodes towards O2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>

Abstract
A maximization of a direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and electrodes can be obtained through the oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. Here, a strategy for obtaining carbon nanotube (CNTs) based electrodes covalently modified with perfectly control&#8208;oriented fungal laccases is presented. Modelizations of the laccase&#8208;CNT interaction and of electron conduction pathways serve as a guide in choosing grafting positions. Homogeneous populations of alkyne&#8208;modified laccases are obtained through the reductive amination of a unique surface&#8208;accessible lysine residue selectively engineered near either one or the other of the two copper centers in enzyme variants. Immobilization of the site&#8208;specific alkynated enzymes is achieved by copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction on azido&#8208;modified CNTs. A highly efficient reduction of O2 at low overpotential and catalytic current densities over &#8722;3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are obtained by minimizing the distance from the electrode surface to the trinuclear cluster.

      <title>Efficient Screening for Ternary Molecular Ionic Cocrystals Using a Complementary Mechanosynthesis and Computational Structure Prediction Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot on predictions! The mechanosynthesis of ternary molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) with significantly different physicochemical properties has been achieved in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding. The crystal structures of the ICCs were successfully predicted by using computational methods. The results pave the way for the efficient screening of higher&#8208;order multicomponent crystal forms with functional properties (see figure).







Abstract
The discovery of molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) widens the opportunities for optimizing the physicochemical properties of APIs whilst facilitating the delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. However, ICCs are often observed serendipitously in crystallization screens and the factors dictating their crystallization are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that mechanochemical ball milling is a versatile technique for the reproducible synthesis of ternary molecular ICCs in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding with or without solvent. Computational crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations have been performed on ternary molecular ICCs for the first time and the observed crystal structures of all the ICCs were correctly predicted. Periodic dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that all the ICCs are thermodynamically stable (mean stabilization energy=&#8722;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) relative to the crystallization of a physical mixture of the binary salt and acid. The results suggest that a combined mechanosynthesis and CSP approach could be used to target the synthesis of higher&#8208;order molecular ICCs with functional properties.

      <title>Catalyst Development for the Synthesis of Ozonides and Tetraoxanes Under Heterogeneous Conditions: Disclosure of an Unprecedented Class of Fungicides for Agricultural Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Being better: A heterogeneous catalyst was developed for the peroxidation of 1,3&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;diketones with hydrogen peroxide with the formation of bridged 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxanes and bridged 1,2,4&#8208;trioxolanes with yield up to 86 and 90&#8201;%, respectively. A new class of antifungal agents for crop protection, that is, cyclic peroxides, was discovered. Some ozonides and tetraoxanes exhibit a very high antifungal activity and are superior to commercial fungicides.







Abstract
The catalyst H3+xPMo12&#8722;x+6Mox+5O40 supported on SiO2 was developed for peroxidation of 1,3&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;diketones with hydrogen peroxide with the formation of bridged 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxanes and bridged 1,2,4&#8208;trioxolanes (ozonides) with high yield based on isolated products (up to 86 and 90&#8201;%, respectively) under heterogeneous conditions. Synthesis of peroxides under heterogeneous conditions is a rare process and represents a challenge for this field of chemistry, because peroxides tend to decompose on the surface of a catalyst . A new class of antifungal agents for crop protection, that is, cyclic peroxides: bridged 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxanes and bridged ozonides, was discovered. Some ozonides and tetraoxanes exhibit a very high antifungal activity and are superior to commercial fungicides, such as Triadimefon and Kresoxim&#8208;methyl. It is important to note that none of the fungicides used in agricultural chemistry contains a peroxide fragment.

Unusual spin&#8208;crossover features of [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]+: The series of compounds [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=a halogen substituent) exhibit 50&#8201;% spin crossover with a broad [HS&#8208;LS] plateau, a magnetic profile hitherto not crystallographically elucidated within the FeIII&#8208;salRen family (R=alkyl group). As its solvated BPh4&#8722; salt, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]+ is LS and undergoes a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray structures of the halo&#8208;substituted complexes [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) [salMeen=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)salicylaldiminate]at RT have revealed the presence of two discrete HS complex cations in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with two perchlorate counter ions linking them by N&#8722;Hamine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Operchlorate interactions. At 90&#8197;K, the two complex cations are distinctly HS and LS, a rare crystallographic observation of this coexistence in the FeIII&#8208;salRen (R=alkyl) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) system. At both temperatures, crystal packing shows dimerization through C&#8722;Himine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ophenolate interactions, a key feature for SCO cooperativity. Moreover, there are noncovalent contacts between the complex cations through type&#8208;II halogen&#8208;halogen bonds, which are novel in this system. The magnetic profiles and M&#246;ssbauer spectra concur with the structural analyses and reveal 50&#8201;% SCO of the type [HS&#8208;HS]&#8596;[HS&#8208;LS] with a broad plateau. In contrast, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]BPh4&#8901;2MeOH is LS and exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition, exemplifying the influence of lattice solvents and counter ions on SCO.

      <title>Multicomponent Self&#8208;Assembly of PdII/PtII Interlocked Molecular Cages: Cage&#8208;to&#8208;Cage Conversion and Self&#8208;Sorting in Aqueous Medium</title>
      <dc:description>
Arm in arm: Hexanuclear interlocked cages of PdII/PtII were synthesized by multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of cis&#8208;blocked Pt/Pd acceptors in combination with a mixture of tripodal flexible and rigid donors.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is an efficient approach for constructing complicated molecules with the aid of reversible bond formation. However, constructing topologically complicated interlocked systems and their formation studies remain challenging tasks. The formation of two water&#8208;soluble hexanuclear interlocked cages by multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of a flexible triimidazole donor (L1) and a rigid tripyridyl donor (L2) based on a triazine core in combination with 90&#176; cis&#8208;blocked PdII and PtII acceptors is reported here. Formation of interlocked systems having a composition of M6(L1)2(L2)2 (M=Pd or Pt) becomes feasible through cavity&#8208;induced self&#8208;recognition of two similar units having a composition of M3(L1)(L2). Self&#8208;sorting of two independently prepared cages of [M3(L1)2] and [M6(L2)4] in aqueous medium leads to the formation of interlocked systems, and their formation was monitored by time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Self&#8208;recognition of L1 by [M6(L2)4] or L2 by [M3(L1)2] leads to the formation of interlocked systems, as confirmed from 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic titrations of L1 with cages {M6(L2)4} and L2 with {M3(L1)2}, respectively. Both the interlocked cages of Pd and Pt are highly stable, and formation of either system is equally probable as observed from the treatments of Pd3(L1)2 with Pt6(L2)4 or Pt3(L1)2 with Pd6(L2)4, which lead to the formation of two different self&#8208;assembled homometallic interlocked cages [Pt6(L1)2(L2)2+Pd6(L1)2(L2)2] instead of forming any other heterometallic assemblies. Formation of interlocked cages is dependent on the steric bulk of the diamine ligand bound to the metal acceptors. A N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted blocking amine prefers the non&#8208;interlocked cage instead of the interlocked analogue.

Self&#8208;recognition of &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; by [M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] or &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; by [M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] leads to the formation of interlocked systems, as confirmed from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic titrations of &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; with cages {M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} and &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; with {M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, respectively. Both the interlocked cages of Pd and Pt are highly stable, and formation of either system is equally probable as observed from the treatments of Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Pt&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which lead to the formation of two different self&#8208;assembled homometallic interlocked cages [Pt&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] instead of forming any other heterometallic assemblies. Formation of interlocked cages is dependent on the steric bulk of the diamine ligand bound to the metal acceptors. A &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted blocking amine prefers the non&#8208;interlocked cage instead of the interlocked analogue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playing with PtII and ZnII Coordination to Obtain Luminescent Metallomesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature mesomorphism was obtained for PtII and ZnII coordination complexes by playing with the coordination ability of a lipophilic gallate unit. The delicate balance between induction of mesomorphism and luminescence in condensed states is discussed (see figure).







Abstract
Blue&#8211;green luminescent terpyridine&#8208;containing PtII and ZnII complexes are reported. Equipped with lipophilic gallate units, which act as monodentate ancillary coordinating ligands and/or as anions, they display low&#8208;temperature mesomorphic properties (lamello&#8208;columnar and hexagonal mesophases for PtII and ZnII complexes, respectively). The mesomorphic properties were investigated by polarised optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X&#8208;ray scattering of bulk materials and oriented thin films. The model of self&#8208;assembly into the lamello&#8208;columnar phase of the PtII complex has been described in detail. The optical properties of the complexes were investigated in the liquid and condensed liquid crystalline states, highlighting the delicate balance between the role of the metal in determining the type of excited state responsible for the emission, and the role of the ancillary ligand in driving intermolecular interactions for proper mesophase formation.

Abstract
A catalyst in which Pd nanoparticles are supported on triangle&#8208;shaped La2O2CO3 nanosheets exposing predominantly the (001) planes (Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS; where TNS denotes triangular nanosheets) was prepared by a facile solvothermal method. The Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and recycling stability for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to hydrocinnamaldehyde with turnover frequency of up to 41&#8201;238&#8197;h&#8722;1. This enhanced activity of Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS results from strong metal&#8211;support interactions. Structure analysis and characterization demonstrated that surface&#8208;oxygen&#8208;enriched La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS supports exposing (001) planes are beneficial to charge transfer between the Pd nanoparticles and triangle&#8208;shaped La2O2CO3 nanosheets and increase the electron density of Pd. Moreover, the modulated electronic states of the Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS catalysts can enhance the adsorption and activation of hydrogen to enhance the hydrogenation activity.

      <title>Stereochemical Rules Govern the Soft Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Compounds: Understanding the Heliconical Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Phases of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Mirror symmetry breaking in fluids: Achiral bent&#8208;shaped molecules form a spontaneous or field induced short&#8208;pitch heliconical lamellar liquid&#8208;crystalline phase. The combination of the helix with the superstructural layer chirality leads to diastereomeric pairs and changes the switching mechanism from the naturally preferred rotation around the molecular long axis, inverting the layer chirality, to a precession on a cone, retaining the chirality.







Abstract
A series of bent&#8208;shaped 4&#8208;cyanoresorcinol bisterephthalates is reported. Some of these achiral compounds spontaneously form a short&#8208;pitch heliconical lamellar liquid&#8208;crystalline phase with incommensurate 3&#8208;layer pitch and the helix axis parallel to the layer normal. It is observed at the paraelectric&#8208;(anti)ferroelectric transition, if it coincides with the transition from random to uniform tilt and with the transition from anticlinic to synclinic tilt correlation of the molecules in the layers of the developing tilted smectic phase. For compounds with long chains the heliconical phase is only field&#8208;induced, but once formed it is stable in a distinct temperature range, even after switching off the field. The presence of the helix changes the phase properties and the switching mechanism from the naturally preferred rotation around the molecular long axis, which reverses the chirality, to a precession on a cone, which retains the chirality. These observations are explained by diastereomeric relations between two coexisting modes of superstructural chirality. One is the layer chirality, resulting from the combination of tilt and polar order, and the other one is the helical twist evolving between the layers. At lower temperature the helical structure is replaced by a non&#8208;tilted and ferreoelectric switching lamellar phase, providing an alternative non&#8208;chiral way for the transition from anticlinic to synclinic tilt.

Most aspects of cellular life are regulated through specific protein&#8211;protein interactions. Classical methods to investigate or manipulate such interactions are based on the shutdown through orthosteric ligands that block the active sites.

      <dc:description>
Spontaneous double mirror symmetry breaking in anisotropic polar fluids is observed in the lamellar liquid crystalline phases of the shown achiral bent&#8208;core molecules, where two distinct modes of supramolecular chirality develop simultaneously. One is the helix formation, driven by the escape from an emerging macroscopic polarization due to the alignment of the bend directions. The other one is caused by the developing tilt of the molecules, reducing the symmetry and leading to superstructural layer chirality.

      <title>Designing Molecular Spanners to Throw in the Protein Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the box: Shutting down protein function with orthosteric inhibitors is a drastic yet popular option. In this Minireview, we illustrate a range of alternatives, including allosteric approaches, to modulate protein functions and protein&#8211;protein interactions in a less indiscriminate manner.







Abstract
Proteins govern most aspects of cellular life and, through specific interfaces, are typically involved in intricate protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) networks and signaling pathways. Subtle up&#8208; or downregulation of key protein functions and PPIs results in disease; still, the preferred option to contrast the role of a protein in disease and healthy conditions alike remains its outright shutdown through orthosteric ligands that block its active site. Here, we explore subtler alternatives to modulate proteins and PPIs. Driven by a view of proteins as dynamic entities, we discuss ways to identify allosteric binding sites, which, when targeted by tailored ligands, can induce significant changes in the active site of a protein, and lead to agonistic or antagonistic effects. We also summarize the selective regulation of specific PPIs&#8212;either direct or allosteric&#8212;and show that effects can be stabilizing as well as destabilizing, depending on how the conformational equilibrium of a protein is shifted.

     alt="Designing Molecular Spanners to Throw in the Protein Networks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Out of the box&lt;/b&gt;: Shutting down protein function with orthosteric inhibitors is a drastic yet popular option. In this Minireview, we illustrate a range of alternatives, including allosteric approaches, to modulate protein functions and protein&#8211;protein interactions in a less indiscriminate manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteins govern most aspects of cellular life and, through specific interfaces, are typically involved in intricate protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) networks and signaling pathways. Subtle up&#8208; or downregulation of key protein functions and PPIs results in disease; still, the preferred option to contrast the role of a protein in disease and healthy conditions alike remains its outright shutdown through orthosteric ligands that block its active site. Here, we explore subtler alternatives to modulate proteins and PPIs. Driven by a view of proteins as dynamic entities, we discuss ways to identify allosteric binding sites, which, when targeted by tailored ligands, can induce significant changes in the active site of a protein, and lead to agonistic or antagonistic effects. We also summarize the selective regulation of specific PPIs&#8212;either direct or allosteric&#8212;and show that effects can be stabilizing as well as destabilizing, depending on how the conformational equilibrium of a protein is shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthetic Strategies for Artificial Lipidation of Functional Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Artificial lipidation: Within cells, lipidated proteins are important regulators for signal pathways. Therefore, the development of chemical and enzymatic synthetic strategies to prepare a range of lipid&#8211;protein conjugates, which can be used to analyze lipidated proteins, is of great importance. Previous developments are summarized in this Minireview.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of natural lipidated proteins is linked to important signal pathways, and therefore analyzing protein lipidation is crucial for understanding cellular functions. Artificial lipidation of proteins has attracted attention in recent decades as it allows modulation of the amphiphilic nature of the protein of interest, and is used in the design of drug&#8208;delivery systems containing antibodies anchored on a lipid bilayer carrier. However, the intrinsic hydrophobicity of lipids makes the synthesis of lipid&#8211;protein conjugates challenging with respect to the yield and selectivity of the lipidation. In this Minireview, the development of chemical and enzymatic synthetic strategies for the preparation of a range of lipid&#8211;protein conjugates that do not compromise the functions of the proteins are discussed as well as applications of the conjugates.

      <title>Reassessment of an Innovative Insulin Analogue Excludes Protracted Action yet Highlights the Distinction between External and Internal Diselenide Bridges</title>
      <dc:description>
A seleno&#8208;analogue of bovine insulin, Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB], in which the external interchain disulfide bond A7&#8722;B7 was replaced by diselenide, preserves biological activity but does not augment stability, protect from proteolysis or confer protracted action.







Abstract
Long&#8208;acting insulin analogues represent the most prescribed class of therapeutic proteins. An innovative design strategy was recently proposed: diselenide substitution of an external disulfide bridge. This approach exploited the distinctive physicochemical properties of selenocysteine (U). Relative to wild type (WT), Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB] was reported to be protected from proteolysis by insulin&#8208;degrading enzyme (IDE), predicting prolonged activity. Because of this strategy's novelty and potential clinical importance, we sought to validate these findings and test their therapeutic utility in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. Surprisingly, the analogue did not exhibit enhanced stability, and its susceptibility to cleavage by either IDE or a canonical serine protease (glutamyl endopeptidase Glu&#8208;C) was similar to WT. Moreover, the analogue's pharmacodynamic profile in rats was not prolonged relative to a rapid&#8208;acting clinical analogue (insulin lispro). Although [C7UA, C7UB] does not confer protracted action, nonetheless its comparison to internal diselenide bridges promises to provide broad biophysical insight.

      <dc:description>
One, two, step: Unprecedent two&#8208;step protocols that enable the multiple functionalization of piperidines to either 4&#8208;substituted or trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;piperidinones are presented herein, some of which were transformed into pharmaceutical alkaloids.







Abstract
Remote and multiple functionalization of piperidines without the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts and elaborate directing groups is one of the major challenges in organic synthesis. Herein is reported an unprecedented two&#8208;step protocol that enables the multiple functionalization of piperidines to either 4&#8208;substituted or trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;piperidones. First, by exploiting the duality of TEMPO reactivity, which under oxidative and thermal conditions fluctuates between cationic and persistent&#8208;radical form, a novel multiple C(sp3)&#8208;H oxidation of piperidines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;piperidones was developed. Second, the intrinsic low reactivity of the unsaturated piperidones toward conjugated Grignard additions was overcome by using trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) as Lewis acid. Subsequently, conjugated Grignard addition/electrophilic trapping protocol provided substituted 2&#8208;piperidone intermediates, some of which were then transformed into pharmaceutical alkaloids.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of a Tricyclic, sp3&#8208;Rich Diazatetradecanedione: an Amino Acid&#8208;Based Natural Product&#8208;Like Scaffold</title>
      <dc:description>
sp3&#8208;Enriched scaffolds: Using simple amino acids, an elaborated synthesis was designed to construct a rigid tricyclic scaffold consisting of six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings.







Abstract
6&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and 8&#8208;membered rings are assembled from a linear precursor by successive cyclisation reactions to construct a tricyclic diazatricyclo[6.5.1.04,&#8201;9]&#8208;tetradecanedione scaffold. Advanced building blocks based on d&#8208;aspartic acid and l&#8208;pyroglutamic acid were combined by a sp3&#8722;sp2 Negishi coupling. A carbamate&#8208;guided syn&#8208;diastereoselective epoxidation followed by an intramolecular epoxide opening allowed the construction of the piperidine ring. An efficient one&#8208;pot hydroxyl&#8208;group protection twofold deprotection reaction prepared the ground for the cyclisation to the bicycle. A final deprotection of the orthogonal protecting groups and lactamisation led to the novel, sp3&#8208;rich tricycle. The final compound is a substrate mimic of peptidyl&#8208;prolyl cis&#8208;trans isomerases featuring a locked trans&#8208;amide bond. Cheminformatic analysis of 179&#8197;virtual derivatives indicates favourable physicochemical properties and drug&#8208;like characteristics. As proof of concept we, show a low micromolar activity in a fluorescence polarisation assay towards the FK506&#8208;binding protein 12.

      <title>[2+2] Photodimerization of Stilbazoles Promoted by Oxalic Acid in Suspension</title>
      <dc:description>
A very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.







Abstract
In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.

     alt="[2+2] Photodimerization of Stilbazoles Promoted by Oxalic Acid in Suspension"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A very simple technique&lt;/b&gt; to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Untapped Opportunities of Resin&#8208;to&#8208;Resin Transfer Reactions (RRTR) for the Convergent Assembly of Multivalent Peptide Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>
Resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions provide a strategic shortcut to convergent peptide assembly, and offer practical advantages with respect to the associated handling issues. Nonetheless, these assets have remained untapped so far and, in this work, the methodology was successfully adopted for the construction of a peptidosteroid adduct. Readily obtained by a fully solid&#8208;phase&#8208;based procedure, this model confirms the synthetic utility and renews the relevance of RRTR to bioconjugate designs.







Abstract
Handling of the individual fragments remains a bottleneck in the convergent assembly of peptides. Overlooked since the emergence of ligation chemistries during the past two decades, so&#8208;called resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions (RRTR) are here described as a strategic shortcut in this context. Condensation of the involved moieties at an acceptor resin is facilitated by shuttling peptide segments directly from a donor resin in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The straightforward synthesis of a sterically constrained 13&#8208;mer peptidosteroid model illustrates the utility of this approach, presenting the first successful application of the RRTR methodology in the field of multivalent design and bioconjugation. Relying on established procedures to generate, monitor and isolate intermediates and products, the solid&#8208;phase nature of the entire strategy allows for the fast construction of polypeptide adducts and libraries thereof. As such, a rejuvenated use and new opportunities for RRTR are reported.

      <title>Improving Tumor&#8208;to&#8208;Background Contrast through Hydrophilic Tetrazines: The Construction of 18F&#8208;Labeled PET Agents Targeting Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal reactions: Hydrophilic tetrazines lead to improved tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background contrast in PET probe construction (see graphic).







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used in the biomedical field. 18F&#8208;TCO/Tetrazine ligation is the most reactive radiolabelled inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but its application had been limited due to modest contrast ratios of the resulting conjugates. Herein, we describe the use of hydrophilic tetrazines to improve tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background contrast of neurotensin receptor targeted PET agents. PET agents were constructed using a rapid Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the radiolabeled trans&#8208;cyclooctene (18F&#8208;sTCO) with neurotensin (NT) conjugates of a 3,6&#8208;diaryltetrazine, 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;aryltetrazine, and a derivative of 3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)tetrazine. Although cell binding assays demonstrated all agents have comparable binding affinity, the conjugate derived from 3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)tetrazine demonstrated the highest tumor to muscle contrast, followed by conjugates of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;aryltetrazine and 3,6&#8208;diaryltetrazine.

      <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Polycyclic Indolones</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a photocatalytic strategy for a rapid and modular access to polycyclic indolones starting from readily available indoles. This strategy relies on the use of redox&#8208;active esters in combination with an iridium&#8208;based photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. The generation of alkyl radicals through decarboxylative single electron reductions enables intramolecular homolytic aromatic substitutions with a pending indole moiety to afford pyrrolo&#8208; and pyridoindolone derivatives under mild conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these radicals could also be engaged into cascades consisting of an intermolecular Giese&#8208;type addition followed by an intramolecular homolytic aromatic substitution to rapidly assemble valuable azepinoindolones.</dc:description>

      <title>Confined Interfacial Synthesis of Highly Crystalline and Ultrathin Graphdiyne Films and Their Applications for N2 Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) as a new carbon allotrope, possessing both sp&#8208; and sp  2&#8208;  hybridized carbon atoms, has attracted extensive attention due to great application potentials in various fields. To realize fundamental understanding of the intrinsic properties of GDY, the controllable synthesis of ultrathin and high crystalline GDY is necessary and challenging. We reported herein a confined interfacial synthesis strategy towards high crystalline ultrathin GDY at water/oil/organogel interface with greatly improved control over GDY structures. The morphology and chemical composition of GDY was characterized accordingly. After loading with Au, the as&#8208;prepared hydrophobic Au/GDY system showed excellent performances in nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), reaching highest yield of 4.15 &#956;g&#183;cm  &#8208;2  &#183;h  &#8208;1  with FE achieving 1.95% .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Supramolecular systems in water are of paramount importance and those based on hydrogen&#8208;bonds are both intriguing and scarce. Here after studying the peculiar host&#8208;guest complexes formed between per&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pillar[5]arene 1 and the bis&#8208;sulfonates 2a&#8208;c, we describe the formation of the first hydrogen bond&#8208;based supramolecular pentagonal boxes (SPBs) which are stable in water. These pH&#8208;responsive SPBs are constructed from 1 as a body, benzene polycarboxylic acids (3a&#8208;b) as lid compounds and 2a&#8208;c as guests. We demonstrate that encapsulation of 2a&#8208;c in pillar[5]arene 1 and in the highly stable water&#8208;soluble SPBs, i. e., 1(3a)2 and 1(3b)2, is both temperature and pH dependent and, quite interestingly, depends, on the nature of the lid compounds used for capping the boxes even at high pH.

      <title>Direct High&#8208;Throughput Screening Assay for mRNA Cap Guanine&#8208;N7 Methyltransferase Activity</title>
      <dc:description>In eukaryotes, mature mRNA is formed through modifications of precursor mRNA, one of which is 5&#8242; cap biosynthesis, involving RNA cap guanine&#8208;N7 methyltransferase (N7&#8208;MTase). N7&#8208;MTases are also encoded by some eukaryotic viruses and facilitate their replication. N7&#8208;MTase inhibitors have therapeutic potential, but their discovery is difficult because long RNA substrates are usually required for activity. Herein, we report a universal N7&#8208;MTase activity assay based on small&#8208;molecule fluorescent probes. We synthesized 12 fluorescent substrate analogs (GpppA and GpppG derivatives) varying in the dye type, dye attachment site, and linker length. GpppA labeled with pyrene at the 3&#8242;&#8208;O position of adenosine acted as an artificial substrate with properties of a turn&#8208;off probe for all three tested N7&#8208;MTases (human, parasite, and viral). Using this compound, a high&#8208;throughput N7&#8208;MTase inhibitor assay was developed and used for screening of synthetic substrate analogs and a commercial library. Several inhibitors with nanomolar activities were identified.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermal Decomposition of Ternary Sodium Graphite Intercalation Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
Producing graphene: Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc).







Abstract
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Detailed comparisons of in situ temperature dependent XRD with TGA&#8208;MS and Raman measurements reveal a series of dynamic transformations during heating. Surprisingly, the bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene sheets. The heating process drives a reorganisation of the solvent and Na molecules, then an evaporation of the solvent; however, the solvent loss is arrested by restacking of the graphene layers, leading to trapped solvent bubbles. Eventually, the bubbles rupture, releasing the remaining solvent and creating expanded graphite. These trapped dopants may provide useful property enhancements, but also potentially confound measurements of grafting efficiency in liquid&#8208;phase covalent functionalization experiments on 2D materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Detailed comparisons of in situ temperature dependent XRD with TGA&#8208;MS and Raman measurements reveal a series of dynamic transformations during heating. Surprisingly, the bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene sheets. The heating process drives a reorganisation of the solvent and Na molecules, then an evaporation of the solvent; however, the solvent loss is arrested by restacking of the graphene layers, leading to trapped solvent bubbles. Eventually, the bubbles rupture, releasing the remaining solvent and creating expanded graphite. These trapped dopants may provide useful property enhancements, but also potentially confound measurements of grafting efficiency in liquid&#8208;phase covalent functionalization experiments on 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design Of Drug&#8208;Like Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction Stabilizers Guided By Chelation&#8208;Controlled Bioactive Conformation Stabilization</title>
      <dc:description>The protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins are a model system for studying PPI stabilization. The complex natural product Fusicoccin A stabilizes many 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPIs but is not amenable for use in SAR studies, motivating the search for more drug&#8208;like chemical matter. However, drug&#8208;like 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers enabling such study have remained elusive. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of a PPI in complex with an extremely low potency stabilizer uncovered an unexpected non&#8208;protein interacting, ligand&#8208;chelated Mg 2+ leading to the discovery of metal ion&#8208;dependent 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilization potency. This originates from a novel chelation&#8208;controlled bioactive conformation stabilization effect. Metal chelation has been associated with pan&#8208;assay interference compounds (PAINS) and frequent hitter behavior, but chelation can evidently also lead to true potency gains and find use as a medicinal chemistry strategy to guide compound optimization. To demonstrate this, we exploited the effect to design the first potent, selective and drug&#8208;like 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Functionalisation of 2D Materials by Batch and Continuous Hydrothermal Flow Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Functionalising 2D materials: In this Minireview, the authors present batch and continuous hydrothermal synthesis of a selection of 2D derivatives (graphene, MXene and molybdenum disulfide), their chemical functionalisation as an advantageous approach in exploring properties of these materials as well as the benefits and challenges of employing these processes, and an outlook for further research.







Abstract
2D materials are single or few layered materials consisting of one or several elements with a thickness of a few nanometres. Their unique, tuneable physical and chemical properties including ease of chemical functionalisation makes this class of materials useful in a variety of technological applications. The feasibility of 2D materials strongly depends on better synthetic approaches to improve properties, increase performance, durability and reduce costs. As such, in the synthesis of nanomaterials, hydrothermal processes are widely adopted through a precursor&#8211;product synthesis route. This method includes batch or continuous flow systems, both employing water at elevated temperatures (above boiling point) and pressures to fine&#8208;tune the physical, chemical, optical and electronic properties of the nanomaterial. Both techniques yield particles with different morphology, size and surface area due to different mechanisms of particle formation. In this Minireview, we present batch and continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis of a selection of 2D derivatives (graphene, MXene and molybdenum disulfide), their chemical functionalisation as an advantageous approach in exploring properties of these materials as well as the benefits and challenges of employing these processes, and an outlook for further research.

      <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Alumination of Terminal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rare earths team up with main&#8208;group elements: Alkynylaluminum compounds are synthesized directly from terminal alkynes and abundant, inexpensive trialkylaluminum reagents through catalytic C&#8722;H bond functionalization using rare&#8208;earth aluminate compounds, in contrast to transition&#8208;metal complexes which catalyze carboaluminations. A saturated lanthanide aluminate adduct, implicated by kinetic studies, provides a rationale for C&#8722;H bond alumination occurring rather than addition.







Abstract
Organoaluminum reagents&#8217; application in catalytic C&#8722;H bond functionalization is limited by competitive side reactions, such as carboalumination and hydroalumination. Herein, rare&#8208;earth tetramethylaluminate complexes are shown to catalyze the exclusive C&#8722;H bond metalation of terminal alkynes with the commodity reagents trimethyl&#8208;, triethyl&#8208;, and triisobutylaluminum. Kinetic experiments probing alkyl&#8208;group exchange between rare&#8208;earth aluminates and trialkylaluminum, C&#8722;H bond metalation of alkynes, and catalytic conversions reveal distinct pathways of catalytic aluminations with triethylaluminum versus trimethylaluminum. Most significantly, kinetic data point to reversible formation of a unique [Ln](AlR4)2&#8901;AlR3 adduct, followed by turnover&#8208;limiting alkyne metalation. That is, C&#8722;H bond activation occurs from a more associated organometallic species, rather than the expected coordinatively unsaturated species. These mechanistic conclusions allude to a new general strategy for catalytic C&#8722;H bond alumination that make use of highly electrophilic metal catalysts.

      <title>Solution Conformations Explain the Chameleonic Behaviour of Macrocyclic Drugs</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular chameleons: NMR spectroscopy and computational studies reveal that macrocyclic drugs in the beyond rule of 5 chemical space behave as molecular chameleons. This allows them to adapt to the environment and combine otherwise conflicting properties including aqueous solubility, cell permeability and target binding.







Abstract
It has been hypothesised that drugs in the chemical space &#8220;beyond the rule of 5&#8221; (bRo5) must behave as molecular chameleons to combine otherwise conflicting properties, including aqueous solubility, cell permeability and target binding. Evidence for this has, however, been limited to the cyclic peptide cyclosporine&#8197;A. Herein, we show that the non&#8208;peptidic and macrocyclic drugs roxithromycin, telithromycin and spiramycin behave as molecular chameleons, with rifampicin showing a less pronounced behaviour. In particular roxithromycin, telithromycin and spiramycin display a marked, yet limited flexibility and populate significantly less polar and more compact conformational ensembles in an apolar than in a polar environment. In addition to balancing of membrane permeability and aqueous solubility, this flexibility also allows binding to targets that vary in structure between species. The drugs&#8217; passive cell permeability correlates to their 3D polar surface area and corroborate two theoretical models for permeability, developed for cyclic peptides. We conclude that molecular chameleonicity should be incorporated in the design of orally administered drugs in the bRo5 space.

In addition to balancing of membrane permeability and aqueous solubility, this flexibility also allows binding to targets that vary in structure between species. The drugs&#8217; passive cell permeability correlates to their 3D polar surface area and corroborate two theoretical models for permeability, developed for cyclic peptides. We conclude that molecular chameleonicity should be incorporated in the design of orally administered drugs in the bRo5 space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boron&#8208;made N2: Realization of a B&#8801;B Triple Bond in the B2Al3&#8208; Cluster</title>
      <dc:description>Until now, all B&#8801;B triple bonds have been achieved by adopting two ligands in the L&#8594;B&#8801;B&#8592;L manner. Here, we report an alternative route of designing the B&#8801;B bonds based on the assumption that by acquiring two extra electrons, an element with the atomic number Z can have properties similar to those of the element with the atomic number Z+2. Specifically, we show that due to the electron donation from Al to B, the negatively charged B&#8801;B kernel in the B2Al3&#8211; cluster mimics a triple N&#8801;N bond. Comprehensive computational searches reveal that the global minimum structure of B2Al3&#8211; exhibits a direct B&#8211;B distance of 1.553 &#197;, and its calculated electron vertical detachment energies are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values of the experimental photoelectron spectrum. Chemical bonding analysis revealed one &#963; and two &#960; bonds between the two B atoms, thus confirming a classical textbook B&#8801;B triple bond, similar to that of N2.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Binding of Mannose&#8208;Specific Synthetic Carbohydrate Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic Carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) that selectively recognize cell&#8208;surface glycans could be used for detection, drug delivery, or as therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of seven new C  2h  symmetric tetrapodal SCRs.

Supramolecular association between these SCRs and 5 biologically relevant C  1  &#8208;O&#8208;octyloxy glycans, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;glucoside (  &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Glc  ), &#945;/&#946;&#8208;mannoside (  &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Man  ), and &#946;&#8208;galactoside (  &#946;&#8208;Gal  ), was studied by mass spectrometry,  1  H NMR titrations, and molecular modeling. These studies revealed that selectivity can be achieved in these tetrapodal SCRs by varying the heterocyclic binding group. We found that  SCR017  (3&#8208;pyrrole),  SCR021  (3&#8208;pyridine), and  SCR022  (2&#8208;phenol) bind only to  &#946;&#8208;Glc  .  SCR019  (3&#8208;indole) binds only to  &#946;&#8208;Man.

      <dc:description>

Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) method is a well&#8208;established method for the growth of surface&#8208;attached metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs). Various experimental parameters, such as surface functionalization or temperature, have been identified as essential in the past. In this study, inspired by these recent insights regarding the LbL SURMOF growth mechanism, the impact of reactant solutions concentration on LbL growth of the Cu2(F4bdc)2(dabco) SURMOF (F4bdc2&#8722;=tetrafluorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate and dabco=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octane) in situ by using quartz&#8208;crystal microbalance and ex situ with a combination of spectroscopic, diffraction and microscopy techniques was investigated. It was found that number, size, and morphology of MOF crystallites are strongly influenced by the reagent concentration. By adjusting the interplay of nucleation and growth, we were able to produce densely packed, yet thin films, which are highly desired for a variety of SURMOF applications.

      <title>Synthesis of Fulvene Vinyl Ethers by Gold Catalysis</title>

Regioselective switch: Gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,5&#8208;diynes with ketones as reagents and solvent provides diversely substituted vinyl ethers under mild conditions. The regioselectivity of such gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations is usually controlled by the scaffold of the diyne.

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,5&#8208;diynes with ketones as reagents and solvent provides diversely substituted vinyl ethers under mild conditions. The regioselectivity of such gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations is usually controlled by the scaffold of the diyne. Herein, we report the first solvent&#8208;controlled switching of regioselectivity from a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208; to 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;cyclization in these transformations, providing fulvene derivatives. With respect to the functional&#8208;group tolerance, aryl fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and ethers are tolerated. Furthermore, the mechanism and selectivity are put to scrutiny by experimental studies and a thermodynamic analysis of the product. Additionally, 6&#8208;(vinyloxy)fulvenes are a hitherto unknown class of compounds. Their reactivity is briefly evaluated, to give insights into their potential applications.

     alt="Synthesis of Fulvene Vinyl Ethers by Gold Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regioselective switch&lt;/b&gt;: Gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,5&#8208;diynes with ketones as reagents and solvent provides diversely substituted vinyl ethers under mild conditions. The regioselectivity of such gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations is usually controlled by the scaffold of the diyne. In this work, the first solvent&#8208;controlled switching of regioselectivity from a 6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cyclization in these transformations, providing fulvene derivatives is reported (see scheme).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,5&#8208;diynes with ketones as reagents and solvent provides diversely substituted vinyl ethers under mild conditions. The regioselectivity of such gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations is usually controlled by the scaffold of the diyne. Herein, we report the first solvent&#8208;controlled switching of regioselectivity from a 6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cyclization in these transformations, providing fulvene derivatives. With respect to the functional&#8208;group tolerance, aryl fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and ethers are tolerated. Furthermore, the mechanism and selectivity are put to scrutiny by experimental studies and a thermodynamic analysis of the product. Additionally, 6&#8208;(vinyloxy)fulvenes are a hitherto unknown class of compounds. Their reactivity is briefly evaluated, to give insights into their potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis, Modification, and Biological Evaluation of a Library of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Thiopyridone&#8208;Based Organometallic Complexes and Their Unexpected (Biological) Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemical concerto: Thiopyridone&#8208;based piano&#8208;stool complexes undergo dimerization in polar protic solvents. The resulting dimers (featuring a double positive charge) were studied for their effects in cancer cells.







Abstract
A series of 16 dinuclear thiopyridone&#8208;based organometallics with excellent water solubility, increased stability and remarkable cytotoxicity were synthesized and characterized. The complexes of this work formed dimeric species featuring a double positive charge in polar protic solvents, accounting for their outstanding solubility in aqueous solution. Most of them displayed higher antiproliferative activity than their parental thiomaltol complex, with unexpected cytotoxicity trends depending on the employed metal center, ligand modification, and cell line. Insights into their behavior in biological systems were gathered by means of amino&#8208;acid interaction studies, cytotoxicity tests in 3D spheroid models, laser ablation, cellular accumulation measurements, as well as cell cycle experiments.

      <title>Structural Peculiarities and Thermoelectric Study of Iron Indium Thiospinel</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron indium thiospinel: Two different mechanisms for the Fe incorporation into indium thiospinel were investigated, namely the charge&#8208;balanced (A1) and the charge&#8208;unbalanced (A2) series. The Fe content (i.e., vacancy concentration) strongly influences the unit cell parameter, charge carrier concentration, charge carrier mobility, as well as thermal conductivity (&#954;tot) in both series.







Abstract
The homogeneity range of ternary iron indium thiospinel at 873&#8197;K was investigated. A detailed study was focused on two distinct series (y=z): 1)&#8197;a previously reported charge&#8208;balanced (In0.67+0.33y&#9633;0.33&#8722;0.33y)tetr[In2&#8722;zFez]octS4 (A1&#8208;series; &#9633; stands for vacancy; the abbreviations &#8220;tetr&#8221; and &#8220;oct&#8221; indicate atoms occupying tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites, respectively) and 2)&#8197;a new charge&#8208;unbalanced (In0.67+y&#9633;0.33&#8722;y)tetr[In2&#8722;zFez]octS4 (A2&#8208;series). Fe atoms were confirmed to exclusively occupy an octahedral position in both series. An unusual reduction of the unit cell parameter with increasing Fe content is explained by differences in the ionic radii between Fe and In, as well as by an additional electrostatic attraction originating from charge imbalance (latter only in A2&#8208;series). The studied compound is an n&#8208;type semiconductor, and its charge carrier concentration increases or decreases for larger Fe content within the A1&#8208; and A2&#8208;series, respectively. The thermal conductivity &#954;tot is significantly reduced upon increasing vacancy concentration, whereas the change of power factor is insufficient to drastically improve the thermoelectric figure of merit.

      <title>Earth&#8208;Abundant Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent fascinating works are summarized that focus on several promising strategies to promote electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting, such as chemical doping, defect (vacancy) engineering, phase engineering, facet engineering, and structural engineering. Finally, the potential for further development in rational electrode materials design is also discussed.







Abstract
The depletion of fossil fuels has accelerated the search for clean, sustainable, scalable, and environmentally friendly alternative energy sources. Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier because of its advantageous properties, and the electrolysis of water is considered as an efficient method for its industrial production. However, the high&#8208;energy conversion efficiency of electrochemical water splitting requires cost&#8208;effective and highly active electrocatalysts. Therefore, researchers have aimed to develop high&#8208;performance electrode materials based on non&#8208;precious and abundant transition metals for conversion devices. Moreover, to further reduce the cost and complexity in real&#8208;world applications, bifunctional catalysts that can be simultaneously active on both the anodic (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and cathodic (i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) sides are economically and technically desirable. This Minireview focuses on the recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts, including several promising strategies to promote electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting in alkaline media, such as chemical doping, defect (vacancy) engineering, phase engineering, facet engineering, and structure engineering.

      <title>Fundamental Insights into the Covalent Silane Functionalization of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Silane grafting: NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were covalently functionalized with using (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules by using a procedure involving a topochemical synthetic approach and an anion exchange process. In the graphic, NiFe&#8208;APTES LDHs are represented by showing the two phases that form the second&#8208;staging interstratified compound which combines the bilayer arrangement of dodecyl sulphate molecules and the APTES covalent grafting.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of 2D anionic materials exhibiting wide chemical versatility and promising applications in different fields, ranging from catalysis to energy storage and conversion. However, the covalent chemistry of this kind of 2D materials is still barely explored. Herein, the covalent functionalization with silanes of a magnetic NiFe&#8208;LDH is reported. The synthetic route consists of a topochemical approach followed by anion exchange reaction with surfactant molecules prior to covalent functionalization with the (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules. The functionalized NiFe&#8208;APTES was fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry and 29Si solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, among others. The effect on the electronic properties of the functionalized LDH was investigated by a magnetic study in combination with M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Moreover, the reversibility of the silane&#8208;functionalization at basic pH was demonstrated, and the quality of the resulting LDH was proven by studying the electrochemical performance in the oxygen evolution reaction in basic media. Furthermore, the anion exchange capability for the NiFe&#8208;APTES was tested employing CrVI, resulting in an increase of 200&#8201;% of the anion retention. This report allows for a new degree of tunability of LDHs, opening the door to the synthesis of new hybrid architectures and materials.

      <title>Aqueous Synthesis of Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles for Synergistic In Vitro and In Vivo Photothermal Chemotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple and one&#8208;step synthetic approach that allows the preparation of well&#8208;defined and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use water&#8208;soluble TPP&#8208;AuNPs is described. The nanoparticles were employed for the first time for in vivo and in vitro combined photothermal&#8208; and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface&#8208;functionalized and F&#8208;108 Pluronic&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs) have been synthesized through a one&#8208;step approach, leading to well&#8208;defined (9.6&#177;1.6&#8197;nm) and water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles by microwave heating an aqueous solution of TPP&#8208;AuICl in the presence of a Pluronic polymer under basic conditions. TPP release was negligible under physiological conditions, but enhanced significantly at an acidic pH (5.4) mimicking that of a cancer cell. Laser irradiation (532&#8197;nm) raised the temperature of an aqueous solution of F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs to 51.7&#8201;&#176;C within 5&#8197;min, confirming efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion capabilities without significant photodegradation. TEM confirmed intracellular localization of F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs in the cytosol, endosomes and lysosomes of HeLa cells. F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs were well tolerated by HeLa cells and zebrafish embryos at ambient temperatures and became toxic upon heat activation, suggesting synergistic interactions between heat and cytotoxic action by TPP.

      <title>Smart Protein&#8208;Based Formulation of Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: Toward Oral Delivery of Insulin</title>
      <dc:description>
Insulin delivery: A pH&#8208;responsive protein combined with the key attributes of dendrimer&#8208;like mesoporous silica nanoparticles act synergistically as a smart oral drug&#8208;delivery platform to reduce substantially the premature release and degradation of gastro&#8208;sensitive insulin. As evidenced by confocal microscopy, the designed nanocarriers mediated significant cellular permeation of the nanopore&#8208;confined fluorescent&#8208;labeled insulin across human intestinal cells (see figure).







Abstract
Oral insulin administration still represents a paramount quest that almost a century of continuous research attempts did not suffice to fulfill. Before pre&#8208;clinical development, oral insulin products have first to be optimized in terms of encapsulation efficiency, protection against proteolysis, and intestinal permeation ability. With the use of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) as an insulin host and together with a protein&#8208;based excipient, succinylated &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin (BL), pH&#8208;responsive tablets permitted the shielding of insulin from early release/degradation in the stomach and mediated insulin permeation across the intestinal cellular membrane. Following an original in vitro cellular assay based on insulin starvation, direct cellular fluorescent visualization has evidenced how DMSNs could ensure the intestinal cellular transport of insulin.

      <title>Preparation, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation of an Azaborondipyrromethene/Zinc Porphyrin/Graphene Supramolecular Nanoensemble</title>
      <dc:description>
A supramolecular multichromophoric azaborondipyrromethene (ABDP)/ zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP)/exfoliated graphene (GR) nanoensemble was prepared and characterized. A pyridine&#8208;functionalized ABDP has been synthesized by complexation with ZnTPP. The nanoensemble photophysics have been evaluated and compared to those of the ABDP/ZnTPP complex, revealing that graphene alters the electronic interactions between the adsorbed chromophores.







Abstract
The preparation of an entirely supramolecular, multichromophoric azaborondipyrromethene (ABDP)/zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP)/exfoliated graphene (GR) nanoensemble was accomplished. The ABDP derivative bears glycol chains for enhancing solubility and a pyridine functionality for allowing coordination with ZnTPP. The ABDP/ZnTPP/GR nanoensemble was characterized in terms of morphology and composition by using complementary microscopy imaging, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The photophysical and electrochemical assessment of ABDP/ZnTPP/GR as well as the binding properties of the ABDP/ZnTPP complex, employed as a reference, are presented. Energy and electron transfer events were observed in ABDP/ZnTPP upon photoexcitation. However, in the case of ABDP/ZnTPP/GR, the graphene&#8208;induced aggregation of the chromophores alters their electronic interactions, enhancing the energy/electron transfer process between them.

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Carbon Framework Anchored Polyoxometalate as a High&#8208;Performance Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate anode: A novel 3D Carbon&#8208;PMo12 composite is fabricated, which displays a significantly improved Li&#8208;ion storage performance as an anode for Li&#8208;ion batteries, with excellent reversible specific capacity and rate capacity.







Abstract
Recently, it has become very important to develop cost&#8208;effective anode materials for the large&#8208;scale use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives for LIB electrodes owing to their reversible multi&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer capacity. Herein, Keggin&#8208;type [PMo12O40]3&#8722; (donated as PMo12) clusters are anchored onto a 3D microporous carbon framework derived from ZIF&#8208;8 through electrostatic interactions. The PMo12 clusters can be immobilized steadily and uniformly on the carbon framework, which provides enhanced electrical conductivity and high stability. Compared with PMo12 itself, the as&#8208;prepared novel 3D Carbon&#8208;PMo12 composite displays a significantly improved Li&#8208;ion storage performance as an LIB anode, with excellent reversible specific capacity and rate capacity, as well as high cycling performance (discharge capacity of 985&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles), which are superior to other POM&#8208;based anode materials reported so far. The high performance of the Carbon&#8208;PMo12 composite can be attributed to the 3D conductive network with fast electron transport, high ratio of pseudocapacitive contribution, and evenly distributed PMo12 clusters with reversible 24&#8208;electron transfer capacity. This work offers a facile way to explore novel LIB anodes consisting of electroactive molecule clusters.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of a Group&#8197;B Streptococcus Type&#8197;III Synthetic Glycan&#8211;Conjugate Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Deciphering the sugar glycocode: Starting from the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of a fragment from Group&#8197;B Streptococcus type&#8197;III capsular polysaccharide in complex with a protective mAb complex, a hexasaccharide comprising exclusively the relevant positions involved in interactions was obtained. By structural and immunogenicity studies it was shown that the synthetic hexasaccharide recognized the mAb similarly to the polysaccharide fragment and, conjugated to a carrier protein, suffices as vaccine antigen.







Abstract
Identification of glycan functional epitopes is of paramount importance for rational design of glycoconjugate vaccines. We recently mapped the structural epitope of the capsular polysaccharide from type&#8197;III Group&#8197;B Streptococcus (GBSIII), a major cause of invasive disease in newborns, by using a dimer fragment (composed of two pentasaccharide repeating units) obtained by depolymerization complexed with a protective mAb. Although reported data had suggested a highly complex epitope contained in a helical structure composed of more than four repeating units, we showed that such dimer conjugated to a carrier protein with a proper glycosylation degree elicited functional antibodies comparably to the full&#8208;length conjugated polysaccharide. Here, starting from the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of the polysaccharide fragment&#8211;mAb complex, we synthesized a hexasaccharide comprising exclusively the relevant positions involved in binding. Combining competitive surface plasmon resonance and saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy as well as in&#8208;silico modeling, we demonstrated that this synthetic glycan was recognized by the mAb similarly to the dimer. The hexasaccharide conjugated to CRM197, a mutant of diphtheria toxin, elicited a robust functional immune response that was not inferior to the polysaccharide conjugate, indicating that it may suffice as a vaccine antigen. This is the first evidence of an X&#8208;ray crystallography&#8208;guided design of a synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based conjugate vaccine.

      <title>Metal Oxide Nanosheets as 2D Building Blocks for the Design of Novel Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Building up: This Review article provides an overview of the synthesis of oxide nanosheets and methods to assemble them into nanocomposites, mono&#8208; or multilayer films. In particular, the use of Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett methods to form monolayer films over large surface areas, and the emerging use of ink jet printing to form patterned functional films is emphasized. The use of nanosheets in various areas of technology, for example, electronics, energy storage and tribology, is highlighted, with a special focus on their use as seed layers for epitaxial growth of thin films, and as electrochemically active electrodes for supercapacitors and Li ion batteries.







Abstract
Research into 2&#8208;dimensional materials has soared during the last couple of years. Next to van der Waals type 2D materials such as graphene and h&#8208;BN, less well&#8208;known oxidic 2D equivalents also exist. Most 2D oxide nanosheets are derived from layered metal oxide phases, although few 2D oxide phases can be also made by bottom&#8208;up solution syntheses. Owing to the strong electrostatic interactions within layered metal oxide crystals, a chemical process is usually needed to delaminate them into their 2D constituents. This Review article provides an overview of the synthesis of oxide nanosheets, and methods to assemble them into nanocomposites, mono&#8208; or multilayer films. In particular, the use of Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett methods to form monolayer films over large surface areas, and the emerging use of ink jet printing to form patterned functional films is emphasized. The utilization of nanosheets in various areas of technology, for example, electronics, energy storage and tribology, is illustrated, with special focus on their use as seed layers for epitaxial growth of thin films, and as electrochemically active electrodes for supercapacitors and Li ion batteries.

      <title>Unusual Racemization of Tertiary P&#8208;Chiral Ferrocenyl Phosphines</title>
      <dc:description>
Enantiomeric excess vanished! Subjected to conventional column chromatography as highly enantioenriched compounds, P&#8208;chiral ferrocenyl phosphines suffered dramatically from racemization when collected at the column outlet even within minutes. What has happened? The authors have thoroughly investigated this most frequently used technique for the purification of such compounds and found a remarkable process as the explanation.







Abstract
Tertiary phosphines are generally known to withstand inversion under moderate conditions. In this work, a remarkable racemization process of three P&#8208;chiral ferrocenyl phosphines is reported. Subjected to conventional column chromatography as highly enantioenriched compounds, they greatly experienced racemization when collected at the column outlet within minutes. Initially, attention was drawn to this unusual inversion behavior after observing that the superb enantiomeric excess of these ligands (&gt;95&#8201;% ee in all cases) was almost lost in their corresponding ruthenium(II) complexes. Successively excluding possible racemization causes, these P&#8208;chiral ferrocenyl phosphines were found to undergo a significant, acid&#8208;catalyzed racemization process at room temperature within a few minutes. This process is mainly observed during standard column chromatography by using conventional silica or alumina, but can also be triggered deliberately by addition of certain acids. Therefore, the stereochemical preservation of P&#8208;chiral phosphines during their purification may per se not always be guaranteed, since column chromatography is the most frequently used technique for purifying such types of compounds.

      <title>2D Nanoarchitectonics: Soft Interfacial Media as Playgrounds for Microobjects, Molecular Machines, and Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic! Special focus is put on dynamic functions at liquid dynamic interfaces as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material systems. Three topics are mainly discussed: (i)&#8197;control of microobject regulations, (ii)&#8197;control of molecular machines with functions of target discrimination and optical outputs, and (iii)&#8197;control of living cells including molecular machine functions at cell membranes and cell behaviors at the liquid interface.







Abstract
Soft and flexible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) systems, such as liquid interfaces, would have much more potentials in dynamic regulation on nano&#8211;macro connected functions. In this Minireview article, we focus especially on dynamic motional functions at liquid dynamic interfaces as 2D material systems. Several recent examples are selected to be explained for overviewing features and importance of dynamic soft interfaces in a wide range of action systems. The exemplified research systems are mainly classified into three categories: (i)&#8197;control of microobjects with motional regulations; (ii)&#8197;control of molecular machines with functions of target discrimination and optical outputs; (iii)&#8197;control of living cells including molecular machine functions at cell membranes and cell/biomolecular behaviors at liquid interface. Sciences on soft 2D media with motional freedom and their nanoarchitectonics constructions will have increased importance in future technology in addition to popular rigid solid 2D materials.

      <title>A Unified and Practical Method for Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Cross&#8208;Coupling using Nickel/Photo Dual Catalysis
</title>
      <dc:description>
All in one: A general method is presented that allows for C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under one set of conditions. An iridium photosensitizer produces an excited nickel(II) complex allowing for the key reductive elimination step that allows for an expansive substrate scope.







Abstract
While carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been extensively studied, many methods are specific and limited to a particular set of substrates or functional groups. Reported here is a general method that allows for C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under one general set of conditions. We propose that an energy transfer pathway, in which an iridium photosensitizer produces an excited nickel(II) complex, is responsible for the key reductive elimination step that couples aryl bromides, iodides, and chlorides to 1&#176; and 2&#176; alcohols, amines, thiols, carbamates, and sulfonamides, and is amenable to scale up via a flow apparatus.

      <title>Controlling the Depolymerization of Paraformaldehyde with Pd&#8211;Phosphine Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
DFT: Paraformaldehyde can be used as synthesis gas (CO/H2) equivalent in catalytic carbonylation reactions. For this reason, it is important to understand its interaction with homogeneous carbonylation catalysts. By applying in situ Raman spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations we have studied the paraformaldehyde depolymerization process and found how its activation energy can be controlled by different Pd&#8211;phosphine complexes (see figure).







Abstract
Paraformaldehyde is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle chemical for the in situ generation of formaldehyde and is, therefore, often used in chemistry, structural biology, or medicine. We have investigated the depolymerization process of paraformaldehyde at different temperatures for the application as C1 surrogate in &#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. Rather surprisingly, it was found that small amounts of commonly applied carbonylation catalysts slow down the depolymerization process significantly. By applying 1H, 17O, and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy coupled with DFT calculations the inhibition process could be assigned to an electron&#8208;withdrawing coordination behavior of the Pd complex at the chain end of the paraformaldehyde chain. This inhibition process can be controlled by the utilized phosphine ligand.

      <title>Luminescent Anion Sensing by Transition&#8208;Metal Dipyridylbenzene Complexes Incorporated into Acyclic, Macrocyclic and Interlocked Hosts</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared by incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of PtII and RuII. Anion titrations with the ruthenium [2]rotaxane demonstrate a marked increase in chloride binding affinity and indicate the interlocked receptor is capable of chloride recognition even in competitive 30&#8201;% aqueous mixtures (see figure).







Abstract
A series of novel acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared by incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of platinum(II) and ruthenium(II). Both the acyclic and macrocyclic derivatives 7&#8901;Pt, 7&#8901;Ru&#8901;PF6, 10&#8901;Pt and 10&#8901;Ru&#8901;PF6 are effective sensors for a range of halides and oxoanions. The near&#8208;infra red emitting ruthenium congeners exhibited an increased binding strength compared to platinum due to the cationic charge and thus additional electrostatic interactions. Intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between the dipyridylbenzene ligand and the amide carbonyls increases the preorganisation of both acyclic and macrocyclic metal derivatives resulting in no discernible macrocyclic effect. Interlocked analogues were also prepared, and preliminary luminescent chloride anion spectrometric titrations with 12&#8901;Ru&#8901;(PF6)2 demonstrate a marked increase in halide binding affinity due to the complementary chloride binding pocket of the [2]rotaxane. 1H&#8197;NMR binding titrations indicate the interlocked dicationic receptor is capable of chloride recognition even in competitive 30&#8201;% aqueous mixtures.

&lt;p&gt;A series of novel acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared by incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of platinum(II) and ruthenium(II). Both the acyclic and macrocyclic derivatives &lt;b&gt;7&#8901;Pt&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7&#8901;Ru&#8901;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;10&#8901;Pt&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;10&#8901;Ru&#8901;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; are effective sensors for a range of halides and oxoanions. The near&#8208;infra red emitting ruthenium congeners exhibited an increased binding strength compared to platinum due to the cationic charge and thus additional electrostatic interactions. Intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between the dipyridylbenzene ligand and the amide carbonyls increases the preorganisation of both acyclic and macrocyclic metal derivatives resulting in no discernible macrocyclic effect. Interlocked analogues were also prepared, and preliminary luminescent chloride anion spectrometric titrations with &lt;b&gt;12&#8901;Ru&#8901;(PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; demonstrate a marked increase in halide binding affinity due to the complementary chloride binding pocket of the [2]rotaxane. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR binding titrations indicate the interlocked dicationic receptor is capable of chloride recognition even in competitive 30&#8201;% aqueous mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Regulable Internal Cavity inside a Resorcinarene&#8208;Based Hemicarcerand</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible accommodation: A resorcinarene&#8208;based capsule with a size&#8208;regulable internal cavity was realized. The alkyl chains connecting its 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms permit expansion and contraction of the cavity by demetalation and metalation. The reversible size change of the capsule enables switching of its molecular recognition properties.







Abstract
Covalent organic capsules, such as carcerands and hemicarcerands, are an interesting class of molecular hosts. These container molecules have confined spaces capable of hosting small molecules, although the fact that the size of the inner cavities cannot be changed substantially limits the scope of their applications. The title covalently linked container was produced by metal&#8208;directed dimerization of a resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand having four 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms on the wide rim followed by olefin metathesis at the vertices of the resulting capsule with a second&#8208;generation Grubbs catalyst. The covalently linked bipyridyl arms permit expansion of the inner cavity by demetalation. This structural change influences the molecular recognition properties; the metal&#8208;coordinated capsule recognizes only 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl, whereas the metal&#8208;free counterpart can encapsulate not only 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl, but also 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;acetoxyphenylethynyl)benzene, which is 9.4&#8197;&#197; longer than the former guest. Molecular mechanics calculations predict that the capsule expands the internal cavity to encapsulate the long guest by unfolding the folded conformation of the alkyl chains, which demonstrates the flexible and regulable nature of the cavity. Guest competition experiments show that the preferred guest can be switched by metalation and demetalation. This external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive guest exchange can be utilized for the development of functional supramolecular systems controlling the uptake, transport, and release of chemicals.

      <title>Controlled Covalent Functionalization of 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 with Molecular or Polymeric Adlayers</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the reaction between 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 and maleimides is presented. The use of a base leads to the formation of a succinimide polymer layer covalently connected to MoS2. In the absence of base, functionalization stops at the molecular monolayer. The functionalization protocol is mild, fast, and very flexible (see scheme).







Abstract
Most air&#8208;stable 2D materials are relatively inert, which makes their chemical modification difficult. In particular, in the case of MoS2, the semiconducting 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 is much less reactive than its metallic counterpart, 1T&#8208;MoS2. As a consequence, there are hardly any reliable methods for the covalent modification of 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2. An ideal method for the chemical functionalization of such materials should be both mild, not requiring the introduction of a large number of defects, and versatile, allowing for the decoration with as many different functional groups as possible. Herein, a comprehensive study on the covalent functionalization of 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 with maleimides is presented. The use of a base (Et3N) leads to the in situ formation of a succinimide polymer layer, covalently connected to MoS2. In contrast, in the absence of base, functionalization stops at the molecular level. Moreover, the functionalization protocol is mild (occurs at room temperature), fast (nearly complete in 1&#8197;h), and very flexible (11&#8197;different solvents and 10&#8197;different maleimides tested). In practical terms, the procedures described here allow for the chemist to manipulate 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 in a very flexible way, decorating it with polymers or molecules, and with a wide range of functional groups for subsequent modification. Conceptually, the spurious formation of an organic polymer might be general to other methods of functionalization of 2D materials, where a large excess of molecular reagents is typically used.

      <title>Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyzed Double Hydroboration of Nitriles: Application to One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Nitriles to Aldimines</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple and effective: Co(acac)2/dperphos system is employed as a precatalyst for efficient hydroboration of nitriles with HBPin to produce of N,N&#8208;diborylamines, which selectively react in situ with aldehydes to give aldimines. The overall transformation represents a synthetically valuable approach to aldimines from nitriles and can be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner, tolerating ester, lactone, carboxamide and unactivated alkene functionalities.







Abstract
The commercially available and bench&#8208;stable Co(acac)2/dpephos system is employed as a precatalyst for selective and efficient room temperature hydroboration of organic nitriles with HBPin to produce a series of N,N&#8208;diborylamines [RN(BPin)2], which react in situ with aldehydes to give aldimines. Formation of aldimines from N,N&#8208;diborylamines does not require a dehydrating agent, is applicable to a wide range of N,N&#8208;diborylamine and aldehyde substrates and is highly chemoselective, being unaffected by various common functional groups, such as alkenes, alkynes, secondary amines, ketones, esters, amides, carboxylic acids, pyridines, nitriles, and nitro compounds. The overall transformation represents a synthetically valuable approach to aldimines from nitriles and can be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner, tolerating ester, lactone, carboxamide and unactivated alkene functionalities.

      <title>Template&#8208;Free Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Trefoil Knots and Double Trefoil Knots Featuring Cp*Rh Building Blocks
</title>
      <dc:description>
Tying the knot: A series of metallarectangles and trefoil knots featuring Cp*Rh building blocks was prepared by the template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly of different rigid and flexible ligands. Furthermore, the trefoil knots could further assemble into rare examples of double trefoil knots through coordination of the amide oxygen atoms to the secondary metal ions.







Abstract
Understanding and controlling the topology of self&#8208;assembled structures plays a fundamental role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, the preparation of a series of tetranuclear metallarectangles and hexanuclear trefoil knots featuring Cp*Rh building blocks by template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly with four different rigid and flexible ligands is described. Transformations between the trefoil knots and the corresponding macrocycles can be induced by using concentration effects. Remarkably, the hexanuclear trefoil knot 5 was shown to assemble further to provide rare examples of [12+1] heteronuclear double trefoil knots (5&#8201;a/5&#8201;b/5&#8201;c/5&#8201;d) through coordination of the amide oxygen atoms to the secondary metal ions Na+/K+/Ca2+/Cd2+. The synthetic results are supported by single&#8208;crystal XRD.

      <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of ZnO&#8211;rGO Core&#8211;Shell Nanorod Hybrids with Photo&#8208; and Electro&#8208;Catalytic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
ZnO&#8211;rGO core&#8211;shell nanorods have been prepared by a new two&#8208;step approach involving solution heating and rapid microwave irradiation. The hybrid possesses extraordinary electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity to the oxygen reduction reaction and RhB dye degradation, respectively.







Abstract
The unique two&#8208;dimensional structure and surface chemistry of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) along with its high electrical conductivity can be exploited to modify the electrochemical properties of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). ZnO&#8211;rGO nanohybrids can be engineered in a simple new two&#8208;step synthesis, which is both fast and energy&#8208;efficient. The resulting hybrid materials show excellent electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity. The structure and composition of the as&#8208;prepared bare ZnO nanorods (NRs) and the ZnO&#8211;rGO hybrids have been extensively characterised and the optical properties subsequently studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (including decay lifetime measurements). The photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine&#8197;B (RhB) dye is enhanced using the ZnO&#8211;rGO hybrids as compared to bare ZnO NRs. Furthermore, potentiometry comparing ZnO and ZnO&#8211;rGO electrodes reveals a featureless capacitive background for an Ar&#8208;saturated solution whereas for an O2&#8208;saturated solution a well&#8208;defined redox peak was observed using both electrodes. The change in reduction potential and significant increase in current density demonstrates that the hybrid core&#8211;shell NRs possess remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared to NRs of ZnO alone.

     alt="Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of ZnO&#8211;rGO Core&#8211;Shell Nanorod Hybrids with Photo&#8208; and Electro&#8208;Catalytic Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZnO&#8211;rGO core&#8211;shell nanorods&lt;/b&gt; have been prepared by a new two&#8208;step approach involving solution heating and rapid microwave irradiation. The hybrid possesses extraordinary electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity to the oxygen reduction reaction and RhB dye degradation, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique two&#8208;dimensional structure and surface chemistry of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) along with its high electrical conductivity can be exploited to modify the electrochemical properties of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). ZnO&#8211;rGO nanohybrids can be engineered in a simple new two&#8208;step synthesis, which is both fast and energy&#8208;efficient. The resulting hybrid materials show excellent electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity. The structure and composition of the as&#8208;prepared bare ZnO nanorods (NRs) and the ZnO&#8211;rGO hybrids have been extensively characterised and the optical properties subsequently studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (including decay lifetime measurements). The photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine&#8197;B (RhB) dye is enhanced using the ZnO&#8211;rGO hybrids as compared to bare ZnO NRs. Furthermore, potentiometry comparing ZnO and ZnO&#8211;rGO electrodes reveals a featureless capacitive background for an Ar&#8208;saturated solution whereas for an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;saturated solution a well&#8208;defined redox peak was observed using both electrodes. The change in reduction potential and significant increase in current density demonstrates that the hybrid core&#8211;shell NRs possess remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared to NRs of ZnO alone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chemical Route to Twisted Graphene, Graphene Oxide and Boron Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>
Let's twist! Covalent cross&#8208;linking of carboxylic groups of graphene through amine functional groups of the linker (trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane) as well as of amine groups of boron nitride with carboxylic groups of the linker (oxalic acid) yields twisted multilayer graphene&#8211;h&#8208;BN superlattice.







Abstract
The recently discovered twisted graphene has attracted considerable interest. A simple chemical route was found to prepare twisted graphene by covalently linking layers of exfoliated graphene containing surface carboxyl groups with an amine&#8208;containing linker (trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane). The twisted graphene shows the expected selected area electron diffraction pattern with sets of diffraction spots out with different angular spacings, unlike graphene, which shows a hexagonal pattern. Twisted multilayer graphene oxide could be prepared by the above procedure. Twisted boron nitride, prepared by cross&#8208;linking layers of boron nitride (BN) containing surface amino groups with oxalic acid linker, exhibited a diffraction pattern comparable to that of twisted graphene. First&#8208;principles DFT calculations threw light on the structures and the nature of interactions associated with twisted graphene/BN obtained by covalent linking of layers.

      <title>Constructive Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Benzodichalcogenophene Junctions</title>
      <dc:description>
Heteroatom substitution into the cores of alternant, aromatic hydrocarbons containing only even&#8208;membered rings is attracting increasing interest as a method of tuning their electrical conductance.

Abstract
Heteroatom substitution into the cores of alternant, aromatic hydrocarbons containing only even&#8208;membered rings is attracting increasing interest as a method of tuning their electrical conductance. Here, the effect of heteroatom substitution into molecular cores of non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, containing odd&#8208;membered rings, is examined. Benzodichalcogenophene (BDC) compounds are rigid, planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, with molecular cores containing five&#8208;membered rings fused to a six&#8208;membered aryl ring. To probe the sensitivity or resilience of constructive quantum interference (CQI) in these non&#8208;bipartite molecular cores, two C2&#8208;symmetric molecules (I and II) and one asymmetric molecule (III) were investigated. I (II) contains S (O) heteroatoms in each of the five&#8208;membered rings, while III contains an S in one five&#8208;membered ring and an O in the other. Differences in their conductances arise primarily from the longer S&#8722;C and shorter O&#8722;C bond lengths compared with the C&#8722;C bond and the associated changes in their resonance integrals. Although the conductance of III is significantly lower than the conductances of the others, CQI was found to be resilient and persist in all molecules.
