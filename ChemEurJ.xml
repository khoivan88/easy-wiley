      <title>Solubility&#8208;Driven Isolation of a Metastable Nonagold Cluster with Body&#8208;Centered Cubic Structure</title>
      <dc:description>The conventional synthetic methodology of atomically precise gold nanoclusters using reduction in solutions offers only thermodynamically most stable nanoclusters. We report herein a solubility&#8208;driven isolation strategy to access the synthesis of a metastable gold cluster. The cluster, with the composition of &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[Au 9 (PPh 3 ) 8 ] + ( 1 ), displays an unusual, nearly perfect body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) structure. As revealed by ESI&#8208;MS and UV/Vis measurement, the cluster is metastable in solution and converts to the well&#8208;known [Au 11 (PPh 3 ) 8 Cl 2 ] + ( 2 ) within just 90 min. DFT calculations revealed that while both 1 and 2 are eight&#8208;electron superatoms, there is a driving force to convert 1 to 2 as shown by the increased cohesion and larger HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 2 . The isolation and crystallization of the metastable gold cluster were achieved in a biphasic reaction system in which reduction of gold precursors and crystallization of 1 took place concurrently. This synthetic protocol represents a successful strategy for investigations of other metastable species in metal nanocluster chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Post&#8208;Metalation Modification of Macrocyclic Dicobalt(III) Metallohost by Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Exchange for Guest Recognition Control</title>
      <dc:description>We propose the post&#8208;metalation modification as a useful strategy to control the guest recognition behavior of a metal&#8208;containing macrocyclic host. This is based on the ligand exchange of the axial ligands of a cobalt(III) dinuclear macrocyclic host, [LCo  2  X  4  ]  2+  (X = axial amine ligand). Four piperidine ligands in [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  (pip = piperidine) were site&#8208;selectively replaced with primary amines. The competitive experiments revealed that the order of the affinity toward the cobalt centers in [LCo  2  X  4  ]  2+  is primary amine &gt; secondary amine &gt; tertiary amine and that the piperidine&#8208;coordinating complex, [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  , was reasonably reactive among the isolable complexes. Indeed, two piperidine ligands at the diagonal positions in [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  were site&#8208;selectively replaced with pyridine or acetate ion.

      <title>Cobalt(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Annulation of Picolinamides with Alkynes via C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Free from any oxidation factor: A co&#8208;oxidant free cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed annulation of alkyne via C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation was developed. Under the optimized reaction condition, the reaction system shows a wide scope of alkynes and obtains the novel annulation acyl&#8208;substituted 1H&#8208;benzoquinoline in good to excellent yields (up to 96&#8201;%).







Abstract
A cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of picolinamides with alkynes via C&#8722;H bond activation has been developed. The operationally simple annulation reaction allows for the synthesis of acyl&#8208;substituted 1H&#8208;benzoquinoline bearing multiple aromatic rings (up to 96&#8201;% yield) without co&#8208;oxidant or other oxidation factors under mild conditions. Several control experiments were carried out. This practical [4+2] annulation provides an efficient route to access highly functionalized compounds.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Click Chemistry for Highly Regioselective Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition by a Photoredox Electron&#8208;Transfer Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
One more click! A novel design strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction by visible&#8208;light catalysis through a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer process (see scheme) has been developed for the first time. The reaction can be performed with a metal&#8208;free catalyst in water using solar energy, making this a sustainable and environmentally friendly photocatalytic system, and represents an important development for click chemistry.







Abstract
Click chemistry focuses on the development of highly selective reactions using simple precursors for the exquisite synthesis of molecules. Undisputedly, the CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is one of the most valuable examples of click chemistry, but it suffers from some limitations as it requires additional reducing agents and ligands as well as cytotoxic copper. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction that involves a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer radical mechanism instead of the traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed coordination process. This newly developed photocatalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction can be performed under mild conditions at room temperature in the presence of air and visible light and shows good functional group tolerance, excellent atom economy, high yields of up to 99&#8201;%, and absolute regioselectivity, affording a variety of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives, including bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. The use of a recyclable photocatalyst, solar energy, and water as solvent makes this photocatalytic system sustainable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction could be photocatalyzed in the presence of a metal&#8208;free catalyst with excellent regioselectivity, which represents an important development for click chemistry and should find versatile applications in organic synthesis, chemical biology, and materials science.

      <title>Salinomycin Derivatives Kill Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Lysosomal Iron Targeting</title>
      <dc:description>
Library of salinomycin derivatives: The search for new candidates to tackle the cancer stem cells (CSC) niche has led to the synthesis of a library of salinomycin derivatives. This study demonstrates that the stereoselective reductive amination at C20 is a key modification for selective targeting of breast CSC. The new C20&#8208;cyclopropylamine derivative exhibited an impressive nanomolar activity against CSC, killing these cells by ROS production, induced after iron accumulation in lysosomes.







Abstract
Salinomycin (1) exhibits a large spectrum of biological activities including the capacity to selectively eradicate cancer stem cells (CSC), making it and its derivatives promising candidates for the development of drug leads against CSC. It has been previously shown that salinomycin and its C20&#8208;propargylamine derivative (Ironomycin (2)) accumulate in lysosomes and sequester iron in this organelle. Herein, a library of salinomycin derivatives is reported, including products of C20&#8208;amination, C1&#8208;esterification, C9&#8208;oxidation, and C28&#8208;dehydration. The biological activity of these compounds is evaluated against transformed human mammary epithelial HMLER CD24low/CD44high cells, a well&#8208;established model of breast CSC, and HMLER CD24high/CD44low cells deprived of CSC properties. Unlike other structural alterations, derivative 4, which displays a cyclopropylamine at position C20, showed a strikingly low IC50 value of 23&#8197;nm against HMLER CD24low/CD44high cells. This study provides highly selective molecules to target the CSC niche, a potential interesting advance for drug development to prevent cancer resistance.

      <title>Non&#8208;emissive Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes as efficient and selective photosensitizers for the photooxidation of benzylamines</title>
      <dc:description>Five new Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes bearing N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)&#8208;8&#8208;amidoquinolate ligands and three of their biscyclometalated Ir(III) congeners have been prepared and employed as photocatalysts (PCs) in the photooxidation of benzylamines with O  2  . In particular, the new Ru(II) complexes do not exhibit photoluminescence but they harvest visible light efficiently and are very stable in solution under irradiation with blue light. Their non&#8208;emissive behavior has been related to the low electrochemical energy gaps and rationalized on the basis of theoretical calculations (DFT analysis), which predict low S  0  &#8592; T  1  energy values. Moreover, the Ru(II) complexes, despite being non&#8208;emissive, display excellent activities in the selective photocatalytic transformation of benzylamines into the corresponding imines. The presence of an electron withdrawing group (&#8211;CF  3  ) on the arene ring of the N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)&#8208;8&#8208;amidoquinolate ligand improves the photocatalytic activity of the corresponding photocatalyst. Furthermore, all the experimental evidences, including Transient Absorption Spectroscopy measurements suggest that singlet oxygen is the actual oxidant. The Ir(III) analogues are considerably more photosensitive and consequently less efficient photosensitizers (PSs).</dc:description>

      <title>Chameleonic Behavior of the &#945;&#8208;Methylcyclopropyl Group and Its Through&#8208;Space Interactions: A Route to Stabilized Three Redox States in Diarylnitroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Redox chameleons: First examples of nitroxide radicals containing &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl (MCP) groups have been synthesized. Different orientations of the &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; MCP substituent relative to the phenyl ring are dependent on the redox state of the system, and through&#8208;space hyperconjugative interactions provide enhanced stability of the radical, cationic, and anionic forms and open the possibility of the new nitroxides to be used as ambipolar redox&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl (MCP) group with conformationally dependent electronic properties is suggested as an additional structural &#8220;instrument&#8221; for stabilization of both open&#8208;shell and ionic states of diarylnitroxides, to be used as &#8220;ambipolar&#8221; redox active materials. New MCP&#8208;substituted diphenylnitroxides (fully characterized by electrochemical, spectral, and X&#8208;ray data) are the most stable nitroxides of the diaryl type known to date [&#964;1/2 in benzene exceeds three months (2310&#8197;h)]. The radicals are capable to reversible oxidation and reduction, yielding stable oxoammonium cations and aminoxyl anions. DFT investigation of the electronic structure and geometry of the compounds confirmed the conformational switching of the cyclopropyl orientation relative to the adjacent aromatic &#960; system is dependent on the nitroxide's redox state. Additional through&#8208;space stabilizing interaction between the &#960;&#8208;acceptor orbital of the NO+ moiety and the cyclopropyl &#8220;banana&#8221; bond orbital was also detected, highlighting its good hyperconjugative ability. The estimated &#963;(para)MCP value (&#8722;0.32) confirms its strong electron&#8208;donating properties.

      <dc:description>
A ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO is reported for supercapacitor applications. The ternary composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 450&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a symmetric cell configuration, with maximum energy density of 131.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and power density of 27.49&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

Abstract
In this work, the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO is reported for supercapacitor applications. The ternary composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 450&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a symmetric cell configuration, with maximum energy density of 131.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and power density of 27.49&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The ternary hybrid also shows a cyclic stability of 91&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations on the structure as well as on the electronic properties of the binary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs and the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO have been carried out. Due to a synergic effect, there are enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and higher quantum capacitance for the hybrid ternary structure compared to VSe2/SWCNTs, leading to higher energy and power density for VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO, supporting our experimental observation. Computed diffusion energy barrier of electrolyte ions (K+) predicts that ions move faster in the ternary structure, providing higher charge storage performance.

      <dc:description>
Artificial protein mimics: The self&#8208;assembly of five peptide coiled&#8208;coil motifs was templated by the hybridization of a d&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an l&#8208;DNA triplex.

Abstract
DNA nanostructures have been designed and used in many different applications. However, the use of nucleic acid scaffolds to promote the self&#8208;assembly of artificial protein mimics is only starting to emerge. Herein five coiled&#8208;coil peptide structures were templated by the hybridization of a d&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an l&#8208;DNA triplex. The self&#8208;assembly of the desired trimeric structures in solution was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and the stabilizing synergy between the two domains was found to be chirality&#8208;independent but orientation&#8208;dependent. This is the first example of using a nucleic acid scaffold of l&#8208;DNA to template the formation of artificial protein mimics. The results may advance the emerging POC&#8208;based nanotechnology field by adding two extra dimensions, that is, chirality and polarity, to provide innovative molecular tools for rational design and bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial protein mimics, programmable materials and responsive nanodevices.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artificial protein mimics&lt;/b&gt;: The self&#8208;assembly of five peptide coiled&#8208;coil motifs was templated by the hybridization of a &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;DNA triplex. The stabilizing cooperation between the two biomolecular domains was shown to be chirality&#8208;independent, but orientation&#8208;dependent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA nanostructures have been designed and used in many different applications. However, the use of nucleic acid scaffolds to promote the self&#8208;assembly of artificial protein mimics is only starting to emerge. Herein five coiled&#8208;coil peptide structures were templated by the hybridization of a &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;DNA triplex. The self&#8208;assembly of the desired trimeric structures in solution was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and the stabilizing synergy between the two domains was found to be chirality&#8208;independent but orientation&#8208;dependent. This is the first example of using a nucleic acid scaffold of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;DNA to template the formation of artificial protein mimics. The results may advance the emerging POC&#8208;based nanotechnology field by adding two extra dimensions, that is, chirality and polarity, to provide innovative molecular tools for rational design and bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial protein mimics, programmable materials and responsive nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;

A newly developed cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) [CpARhIII] complex, bearing an acidic secondary amide moiety on the Cp ring, is able to catalyze the ortho&#8208;bromination of O&#8208;phenyl carbamates with NBS at room temperature.

      <title>Enhanced NiO dispersion on a high surface pillared heterostructure covered by niobium leads to an optimal behavior in the ODH of ethane</title>
      <dc:description>Nb&#8208;containing siliceous porous clay heterostructure (PCH) (Nb&#8208;content from 0 to 30 wt%), prepared from a bentonite, has been used as effective support in the preparation of supported NiO catalysts (with NiO loading from 15 to 80 wt%). Supports and NiO&#8208;containing catalysts have been characterized by several physicochemical techniques, and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The characterization results on Nb&#8208;containing supports show the presence of well&#8208;anchored Nb  5+  species, without the formation of Nb  2  O  5  crystals. A high dispersion of nickel oxide (which presents a low crystallinity) has been observed when using the Nb&#8208;containing PCH supports. In addition, when NiO is supported on these Nb&#8208;containing porous clays, it displays a higher effectiveness in the ODH of ethane (ethylene selectivity of ca. 90 %) than NiO supported on the corresponding Nb&#8208;free siliceous PCH or on Nb  2  O  5  (ethylene selectivity of ca. 30 and 60 %, respectively). Factors such as the NiO&#8208;Nb  5+  interaction, NiO particle size and the properties of surface Ni  n+  species have shown to be determining for the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Precursor Design Strategies for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Functional Oxides: It's All in the Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Overview of the different explored low&#8208;temperature strategies increasing the energy efficiency for functional oxide synthesis, taking into account the application of green precursors and atom economy considerations.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;based (multi)metal oxide synthesis has been carried out employing a large diversity of precursor routes. The selection of an appropriate synthesis strategy is frequently dictated by the resulting material properties, although this choice should also be based on green chemistry principles, atom economy considerations and energy efficiency. In order to limit the required energy budget to convert the chemical precursor to the target oxide material, various approaches were recently reported. This Review summarizes some frequently encountered low&#8208;temperature routes, critically assessing their application window and advantages. More specifically, auto&#8208;combustion synthesis, UV&#8208;assisted decomposition routes, sol&#8211;gel network adjustments and precursor complex design concepts are discussed. It is expected that this toolbox of low&#8208;temperature strategies may assist further progress in the field, stimulating novel applications, such as flexible electronics or organic&#8211;oxide hybrid materials, which are very sensitive to the temperature requirements.

&lt;p&gt;It has been established that a newly developed cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) [Cp&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;] complex, bearing an acidic secondary amide moiety on the Cp ring, is able to catalyze the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bromination of O&#8208;phenyl carbamates with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) at room temperature. The presence of the acidic secondary amide moiety on the Cp&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; ligand accelerates the bromination by the hydrogen bond between the acidic NH group of the Cp&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; ligand and the carbonyl group of NBS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A General Approach to Enzyme&#8208;Responsive Liposomes</title>
      <dc:description>Liposomes are effective nanocarriers due to their ability to deliver encapsulated drugs to diseased cells. Nevertheless, liposome delivery would be improved by enhancing the ability to control the release of contents at the target site. While various stimuli have been explored for triggering liposome release, enzymes provide excellent targets due to their common overexpression in diseased cells. We present a general approach to enzyme&#8208;responsive liposomes exploiting targets that are commonly aberrant in disease, including esterases, phosphatases and &#946;&#8208;galactosidases. Responsive lipids correlating with each enzyme family were designed and synthesized bearing an enzyme substrate moiety attached via a self&#8208;immolating linker to a non&#8208;bilayer lipid scaffold, such that enzymatic hydrolysis triggers lipid decomposition to disrupt membrane integrity and release contents. Liposome dye leakage assays demonstrated that each enzyme&#8208;responsive lipid yielded significant content release upon enzymatic treatment compared to minimal release in controls. Results also showed that fine&#8208;tuning liposome composition was critical for controlling release. DLS analysis showed particle size increases in the cases of esterase&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive lipids, supporting alterations to membrane properties. These results showcase an effective modular strategy that can be tailored to target different enzymes, providing a promising new avenue for advancing liposomal drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly efficient luminescent solar concentrators based on benzoheterodiazole dyes with large Stokes&#8217; shifts</title>
      <dc:description>Five extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties have been synthesized. Their basic D&#8208;A&#8208;D structural motif is a benzothiadiazole unit symmetrically equipped with two thiophene rings (  S2T  ). Its variants include (i) the same molecular framework where sulfur is replaced by selenium (  Se2T  ), also with four thiophene units (  Se4T  ) and (ii) a D&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D system having a N&#8208;carbazole donor moiety at one end (  CS2T  ) and a D&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217; array with a further acceptor carbonyl unit at the other extremity (  CS2TCHO  ). The goal is taking advantage of the intense luminescence and large Stokes&#8217; shifts of the five molecules for use in luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). All of them exhibit intense absorption spectra in the UV&#8208;VIS region down to 630 nm, which are fully rationalized by DFT. Emission properties have been studied in CH  2  Cl  2  (298 and 77 K) as well as in PMMA and PDMS matrices, measuring photoluminescence quantum yields (up to 98%) and other key optical parameters. The dye&#8208;PMMA systems show performances comparable to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, in terms of optical and external quantum efficiencies (OQE = 47.6% and EQE = 31.3%, respectively) and flux gain (F = 10.3), with geometric gain close to 90. LSC devices in which the five emitters are embedded in PDMS and their waveguided VIS luminescence feeds amorphous silicon cells have been fabricated and tested.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Magnetic Feature in Zigzag&#8208;Edged Nanographenes via Controlled Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nanographenes (NGs) with tunable electronic and magnetic properties have attracted enormous attention in the realm of carbon&#8208;based nanoelectronics. In particular, NGs with biradical character at the ground state are promising building units for molecular spintronics. However, most of the biradicaloids are susceptible to oxidation under ambient conditions and photolytic degradation, which hamper their further applications. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of tuning the magnetic properties of zigzag&#8208;edged NGs in order to enhance their stability via the controlled Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of  peri  &#8208;tetracene (  4&#8208;PA  ). The unstable  4&#8208;PA  (  y  0  = 0.72; half&#8208;life,  t  1/2  = 3 h) was transformed into the unprecedented benzo&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracenes (  BPTs  ) by one&#8208;side Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which is featured a biradical character at the ground state (  y  0  = 0.60) and exhibits remarkable stability under ambient conditions for several months. In addition, the fully zigzag&#8208;edged circumanthracenes (  CAs  ) were achieved by two&#8208;fold or step&#8208;wise Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of  4&#8208;PA  , in which the magnetic property could be controlled by employing the corresponding dienophiles. Our work reported herein opens avenues for the synthesis of novel zigzag&#8208;edged NGs with tailor&#8208;made magnetic properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Computational Study of spx(x=1&#8208;3)&#8208;Hybridized Be&#8208;Be Bonds Stabilized by Amidinate Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>The complexes containing odd&#8208;electron Be&#8208;Be bond are rare until now.  Hereby, a series of neutral di&#8208;beryllium amidinate complexes containing Be&#8208;Be bond were explored theoretically.

The detailed bonding analyses reveal the localized electrons of Be&#8208;Be fragment can be adjusted by the amount of AMD ligands because each AMD ligand only takes one electron from the Be  2  . Meanwhile, the hybridization of the central Be atom also changes as the number of AMD ligands increases. In particular, the  sp  3  &#8208;  hybridized  single&#8208;electron Be&#8208;Be bond is firstly identified in tri&#8208; AMD ligands chelated neutral  D  3h  &#8208;  Be  2  (AMD)  3  complex, which also possesses the higher stability compared to its monoanionic  D  3h  &#8208;  Be  2  (AMD)  3  &#8208;  and  monocationic  C  3  &#8208;  Be  2  (AMD)  3  +  .

The detailed bonding analyses reveal the localized electrons of Be&#8208;Be fragment can be adjusted by the amount of AMD ligands because each AMD ligand only takes one electron from the Be  2  . Meanwhile, the hybridization of the central Be atom also changes as the number of AMD ligands increases. In particular, the  sp  3  &#8208;  hybridized  single&#8208;electron Be&#8208;Be bond is firstly identified in tri&#8208; AMD ligands chelated neutral  D  3h  &#8208;  Be  2  (AMD)  3  complex, which also possesses the higher stability compared to its monoanionic  D  3h  &#8208;  Be  2  (AMD)  3  &#8208;  and  monocationic  C  3  &#8208;  Be  2  (AMD)  3  +  . I  mportantly, our study provides a new approach to obtain a neutral odd&#8208;electron Be&#8208;Be bond, namely by using of radical ligands through side&#8208;on chelation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Spin&#8208;orbit (SO) heavy&#8208;atom on the light&#8208;atom (SO&#8208;HALA) effect is the largest relativistic effect caused by a heavy atom on its light&#8208;atom neighbors, leading, e.g. to unexpected NMR chemical shifts of 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei, when bonded to a HA. In this study, a combined experimental and theoretical evidence for the SO&#8208;HALA effect transmitted through hydrogen bond is presented. Solid&#8208;state NMR data for a series of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine salts containing I&#8211;, Br&#8211; and Cl&#8211; counter ions were obtained experimentally and by theoretical calculations. A comparison of the experimental chemical shifts with those calculated by a standard DFT methodology without the SO contribution to the chemical shifts revealed a remarkable error of the calculated proton chemical shift of a hydrogen atom that is in close contact with the iodide anion. The addition of the relativistic SO correction in the calculations significantly improves overall agreement with the experiment and confirms the propagation of the SO&#8208;HALA effect through hydrogen bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of Absolute Stereochemistry in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Borrowing Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen borrowing catalysis represents a powerful method for the alkylation of amine or enolate nucleophiles with unactivated alcohols. This approach relies upon a catalyst which can mediate a strategic series of redox events, enabling the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bonds and producing water as the sole by&#8208;product. In the majority of cases these reactions have been employed to target achiral or racemic products. In contrast, the focus of this minireview is upon hydrogen borrowing catalyzed reactions in which the absolute stereochemical outcome of the process can be controlled. Asymmetric hydrogen borrowing catalysis is rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amine and carbonyl containing products and examples involving both C&#8211;N and C&#8211;C bond formation are presented. A variety of different approaches are discussed including use of chiral auxiliaries, asymmetric catalysis and enantiospecific processes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Copper efflux oxidase (CueO) from Escherichia coli is a special bacterial laccase due to its fifth copper binding site. In contrast with previous reports, this work illustrates the relationship between the fifth copper region and electrocatalytic properties. Through a semi&#8208;rational design, an increase in localized structural stability and a decrease of electron transfer pathway are found to contribute to beneficial CueO variants. It may give clues on how to tailor laccases or other oxidoreductases for bioelectrocatalytic applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Zhang, U.

      <title>Cover Feature: Metallation&#8208;Induced Heterogeneous Dynamics of DNA Revealed by Single&#8208;Molecule FRET (Chem. Eur. J. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The metallation of a DNA hairpin by an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex was studied using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. Ensemble measurements suggested simple, two&#8208;state opening and closing of the hairpin, while single&#8208;molecule experiments revealed complex DNA dynamics which are attributed to different degrees of metallation of the GC&#8208;rich hairpin stem. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;J. Sadler, S.&#8197;W. Magennis, et&#8197;al. on page 4980.

The path that led to our current understanding on the mechanism of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis is reviewed. There are strong evidences supporting the currently accepted mechanisms, but there are novel studies that challenge them, bringing thereby both earlier and novel ideas to surface. The occurrence of carbene intermediates is questioned, while the formation of radical intermediates is discussed in current literature, highlighting the necessity for further studies in the field.

Synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis is becoming a proficient method for the development of catalytic reactions, including several new and efficient cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Additionally, several challenging asymmetric reactions, including stereodivergent synthesis, have been discovered by the combined use of a chiral metal catalyst and a second achiral metal catalyst or two chiral metal catalysts.







Abstract
Synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis has been utilized in the Sonogashira reaction since 1975. However, this strategy has not received much attention from the organic chemist community until recently. Synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis is becoming a proficient method for the development of catalytic reactions, including several new and efficient cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Additionally, several challenging asymmetric reactions, including stereodivergent synthesis, have been discovered by the combined use of a chiral metal catalyst and a second achiral metal catalyst or two chiral metal catalysts. This review provides an overview of this field, with the aims of highlighting both the development of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis in organic synthesis and the reaction mechanisms involved in this research area.

      <title>The Mechanism of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis through a Magnifying Glass</title>
      <dc:description>
How does it really work? The mechanism of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis has been the subject of debate throughout the last century. Novel results put this old discussion back into focus, revealing more details about these valuable processes. This review summarizes the key elements of the progress, highlighting the arguments that led to the presently accepted mechanistic picture, and underlining the still open conceptual questions.







Abstract
The term &#8220;N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis&#8221; is often invoked in organic synthesis for reactions that are catalyzed by different azolium salts in the presence of bases. Although the mechanism of these reactions is considered today evident, a closer look into the details that have been collected throughout the last century reveals that there are many open questions and even contradictions in the field. Emerging new theoretical and experimental results offer solutions to these problems, because they show that through considering alternative reaction mechanisms a more consistent picture on the catalytic process can be obtained. These novel perspectives will be able to extend the scope of the reactions that we call today N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis.

These novel perspectives will be able to extend the scope of the reactions that we call today N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(Carbonylamino)alkenylindium through Regioselective anti&#8208;Carboindation of Ynamides and Its Transformation to Multisubstituted Enamides</title>
      <dc:description>
Regioselective anti&#8208;carboindation: The regioselective anti&#8208;carboindation of ynamides with InBr3 and silyl ketene acetals was achieved to give &#946;&#8208;(carbonylamino)alkenylindium. Superior &#960;&#8208;electron affinity of InBr3 efficiently activated the triple bond of an ynamide despite the existence of an amide moiety. The regioselectivity of the nucleophilic attack of a silyl ketene acetal was controlled by the polarization of a triple bond derived from a nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The regioselective anti&#8208;carboindation of ynamides by using InBr3 and silylated nucleophiles was developed to synthesize (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(carbonylamino)alkenylindiums. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of an alkenylindium suggested that the reaction proceeded in an anti&#8208;addition fashion. In contrast to reported syn&#8208;carbometalations of ynamides by using organometallics, a cooperation of InBr3 and silylated nucleophiles to ynamides achieved an anti&#8208;addition, which was supported by DFT calculations. The scope of substrates included various ynamides and silylated nucleophiles, such as silyl ketene acetals and silyl ketene imines. The transformation of synthesized alkenylindiums by iodination, radical coupling, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling successfully afforded trisubstituted enamines with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

      <title>Halogen&#8211;C2H2 Binding in Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Benchmark C2H2/CO2 Separation Selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
A new benchmark for C2H2 separation over CO2 was set by a crystal engineered family of ultramicroporous halogen&#8208;functionalised MOFs, thanks to acetylene binding sites involving C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen interactions. Trace C2H2 capture was realized in these hydrolytically stable sorbents, only the second occurrence among metal&#8211;organic physisorbents (see figure).







Abstract
Acetylene (C2H2) capture is a step in a number of industrial processes, but it comes with a high&#8208;energy footprint. Although physisorbents have the potential to reduce this energy footprint, they are handicapped by generally poor selectivity versus other relevant gases, such as CO2 and C2H4. In the case of CO2, the respective physicochemical properties are so similar that traditional physisorbents, such as zeolites, silica, and activated carbons cannot differentiate well between CO2 and C2H2. Herein, we report that a family of three isostructural, ultramicroporous (&lt;7&#8197;&#197;) diamondoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks, [Cu(TMBP)X] (TMBP=3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyrazole), TCuX (X=Cl, Br, I), offer new benchmark C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity at ambient temperature and pressure. We attribute this performance to a new type of strong binding site for C2H2. Specifically, halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC interactions coupled with other noncovalent in a tight binding site is C2H2 specific versus CO2. The binding site is distinct from those found in previous benchmark sorbents, which are based on open metal sites or electrostatic interactions enabled by inorganic fluoro or oxo anions.

      <title>Irreversible Structural Changes of Copper Hexacyanoferrate Used as a Cathode in Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The morphology, composition, oxidation state, and crystal structure changes occurring in copper hexacyanoferrate&#8208;based cathodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are investigated to understand degradation of the cathodes after few hundred cycles. Electron microscopy reveals the substitution of Cu ions by Zn ions in the lattice resulting in the formation of wires and cubes from the initial copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles.







Abstract
The structural changes of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF), a Prussian blue analogue, which occur when used as a cathode in an aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery, are investigated using electron microscopy techniques. The evolution of ZnxCu1&#8722;xHCF phases possessing wire and cubic morphologies from initial CuHCF nanoparticles are monitored after hundreds of cycles. Irreversible introduction of Zn ions to CuHCF is revealed locally using scanning transmission electron microscopy. A substitution mechanism is proposed to explain the increasing Zn content within the cathode material while simultaneously the Cu content is lowered during Zn&#8208;ion battery cycling. The present study demonstrates that the irreversible introduction of Zn ions is responsible for the decreasing Zn ion capacity of the CuHCF cathode in high electrolyte concentration.

      <title>Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emitting Benzorhodamines and Their Applications to Bioimaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Photostable and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting organic fluorophores with large Stokes shifts are in great demand for long&#8208;term bioimaging at deeper depths with minimal autofluorescence and self&#8208;quenching. We report a new class of benzorhodamines and their analogues that are photostable and emit in the NIR region (up to 785 nm) with large Stokes shifts (&gt;120 nm). The synthesis involves condensation of 7&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, which leads to bent&#8208;shape benzorhodamines that emit orange fluorescence (~600 nm); however, introduction of steric hindrance near the condensation site switches the regioselectivity, providing a linear benzorhodamine system for the first time. The linear benzorhodamine derivatives provide bright fluorescence images in cell as well as in tissue. A carboxy benzorhodamine is applied for photothermal therapy of cancer cells as well as xenograft cancer mice.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium Nanoparticles as a Novel Photosensitizing Agent in Photodynamic Therapy against Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy is a promising alternative treatment for different types of cancer due to its high selectivity, which prevents healthy tissues from being damaged. The use of nanomaterials in photodynamic therapy has several advantages over classical photosensitizing agents, due to their unique properties and their ability to be functionalized. Especially interesting is the use of metallic nanoparticles, capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation to either transfer this energy to oxygen molecules for the generation of ROS or dissipate it as heat. Although previous reports have demonstrated the capacity of Rh derivatives as anti&#8208;tumour drugs, there are no studies on the potential of small&#8208;sized Rh nanoparticles as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. In this study, 5 nm Rh nanoparticles has been synthesized and their potential in photodynamic therapy has been evaluated.

      <title>Electroactive Organic Building Blocks for the Chemical Design of Functional Porous Frameworks (MOFs &amp; COFs) in Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>Electroactive organic molecules have received a lot of attention in the field of electronics because of their fascinating electronic properties, easy functionalization and potential low cost towards their implementation in electronic devices. In recent years, electroactive organic molecules have also emerged as promising building blocks for the design and construction of crystalline porous frameworks such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks (COFs) for application in electronics. Such porous materials present certain additional advantages such as, for example, an immense structural and functional versatility, combination of porosity with multiple electronic properties and the possibility of tuning their physical properties by post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In this review, we summarize the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials (MOFs &amp; COFs) for electronics with special emphasis on their electronic structure and functionality relationships. The different building blocks have been classified based on the electronic nature and main function of the resulting porous frameworks. The design and synthesis of novel electroactive organic molecules is encouraged towards the construction of functional porous frameworks exhibiting new functionalities and applications in electronics.</dc:description>

In this review, we summarize the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials (MOFs &amp; COFs) for electronics with special emphasis on their electronic structure and functionality relationships. The different building blocks have been classified based on the electronic nature and main function of the resulting porous frameworks. The design and synthesis of novel electroactive organic molecules is encouraged towards the construction of functional porous frameworks exhibiting new functionalities and applications in electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The development of batteries and fuel cells has brought to light a need for carbon anode materials doped homogeneously with electrocatalytic metals.

      <title>Heavy Atom Tunneling in Semibullvalenes: How Driving Force, Substituents, and Environment Influence the Tunneling Rates</title>
      <dc:description>The Cope rearrangement of selectively deuterated isotopomers of 1,5&#8208;dimethylsemibullvalene 2a and 3,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#173;semibullvalene 2b were studied in cryogenic matrices. In both semibullvalenes the Cope rearrangement is governed by heavy atom tunneling (HAT). The driving force for the rearrangements is the small difference in the zero&#8208;point vibrational energies of the isotopomers. To evaluate the effect of the driving force on the tunneling probability in 2a and 2b, two different pairs of isotopomers were studied for each of the semibullvalenes. The reaction rates for the rearrangement of 2b in cryogenic matrices were found to be smaller than the ones of 2a under similar conditions, whereas differences in the driving force do not influence the rates. Small curvature tunneling (SCT) calculations suggest that the reduced tunneling rate of 2b compared to that of 2a results from a change in the shape of the potential energy barrier. The tunneling probability of the semibullvalenes strongly depends on the matrix environment, however, for 2a in a qualitatively different way than for 2b.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanism and Origin of MAD&#8208;Induced Ni/N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective C&#8722;H Cyclization of Pyridines with Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
DFT calculations show a new mechanism, in which a unique H&#8208;migration assisted oxidation metalation (HMAOM) step is identified as the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The newly proposed mechanism can well rationalize the regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H cyclization of pyridines with alkenes and also unveil the reasons that the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand and the MAD additive can facilitate the reaction (see figure).







Abstract
This work presents a DFT&#8208;based computational study on the regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines with alkenes at the relatively unreactive C4&#8208;position, which was successfully achieved by Shi et&#8197;al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 5628&#8211;5634] using Ni0/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under the assistance of an aluminum&#8208;based Lewis acid additive (2,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;C6H2O)2AlMe (MAD). The calculations indicate that the selective functionalization involves a three&#8208;step mechanism in which a unique H&#8208;migration assisted oxidation metalation (HMAOM) step is identified as the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The newly proposed mechanism can well rationalize the experimental observation that the preferred product is the endo&#8208;type (vs. exo&#8208;type), R&#8208;configuration (vs. S&#8208;configuration) product at the C4 (vs. C2) position, and also unveil the reasons that the NHC ligand and the MAD additive can facilitate the reaction.

      <title>Stability, Structure and Reconstruction of 1H&#8208;Edges in MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
A complete density functional study of S&#8208;terminated edges in 1H&#8208;MoS2 finds new potential entropically favored structures for Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges, and proposes a Peierls&#8217; distortion model explaining the stability of triply periodic Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges.







Abstract
Density functional studies of the edges of single&#8208;layer 1H&#8208;MoS2 are presented. This phase presents a rich variability of edges that can influence the morphology and properties of MoS2 nano&#8208;objects, play an important role in industrial chemical processes, and find future applications in energy storage, electronics and spintronics. The so&#8208;called Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges vertical S&#8208;dimers were confirmed to be stable, however the authors also identified a family of metastable edges combining Mo atoms linked by two&#8208;electron donor symmetrical disulfide ligands and four&#8208;electron donor unsymmetrical disulfide ligands. These may be entropically favored, potentially stabilizing them at high temperatures as a &#8220;liquid edge&#8221; phase. For Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges, S&#8208;bridge structures with 3&#215; periodicity along the edge are the most stable, compatible with a Peierls&#8217; distortion arising from the d&#8208;bands of the edge Mo atoms. An additional explanation for this periodicity is proposed through the formation of 3&#8208;center bonds.

      <title>Exploring the Biocatalytic Potential of Fe/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate halogenases are turning into valuable tools for the stereoselective incorporation of halogen atoms into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. To date, halogenases which selectively derivatize free amino acids or indole alkaloids have been discovered. While first enzyme engineering examples highlight that the substrate scope can be expanded, structural and biochemical characterizations continue to inform about the enzymes&#8217; catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Freestanding Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the installation of halogen atoms into unactivated sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon centers with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Since their discovery in 2014, a small number of indole alkaloid and amino acid halogenases have been identified and characterized. First enzyme engineering examples suggest that the accessible substrate range of these enzymes may be expanded through the use of rational enzyme design and directed evolution. Structural investigations of non&#8208;heme iron halogenases acting on freestanding as well as tethered substrates are beginning to inform about the principles of the underlying halogenation mechanism.

      <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Reaction of gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes: Reactivity Toward Diverse 1,1&#8208;Bisborylalkanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical chemistry! The use of gem&#8208;bis&#8208;metalated&#8208;alkenes, that is, vinyl gem&#8208;diboron&#8208;compounds, as radical&#8208;labile substrates is explored. The knowledge gained provided an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reactivity of the radical intermediates of geminal&#8208;metalated ethane. This methodology can serve as the late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules and simple organic molecules in which it drives the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylalkanes (see scheme).







Abstract
The use of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes as radical&#8208;reactive groups is explored for the first time. These reactions provide an efficient and general method for the photochemical conversion of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to rapidly access 1,1&#8208;bisborylalkanes. This method exploits a novel photoredox decarboxylative radical addition to gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to afford &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;diboryl carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which benefit from additional stability by virtue of an interaction with the empty p&#8208;orbitals on borons. The reaction offers a highly modular and regioselective approach to &#947;&#8208;amino gem&#8208;diborylalkanes. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have provided insight into the radical mechanism underlying the photochemistry reaction and the stability of the bis&#8208;metalated radicals, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radical chemistry&lt;/b&gt;! The use of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bis&#8208;metalated&#8208;alkenes, that is, vinyl &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diboron&#8208;compounds, as radical&#8208;labile substrates is explored. The knowledge gained provided an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reactivity of the radical intermediates of geminal&#8208;metalated ethane. This methodology can serve as the late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules and simple organic molecules in which it drives the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diborylalkanes (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diborylalkenes as radical&#8208;reactive groups is explored for the first time. These reactions provide an efficient and general method for the photochemical conversion of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diborylalkenes to rapidly access 1,1&#8208;bisborylalkanes. This method exploits a novel photoredox decarboxylative radical addition to &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diborylalkenes to afford &#945;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diboryl carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which benefit from additional stability by virtue of an interaction with the empty p&#8208;orbitals on borons. The reaction offers a highly modular and regioselective approach to &#947;&#8208;amino &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diborylalkanes. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have provided insight into the radical mechanism underlying the photochemistry reaction and the stability of the bis&#8208;metalated radicals, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C&#8722;F Arylation of Polyfluorophenols by Means of Sigmatropic Dearomatization/Defluorination Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence: interrupted Pummerer reaction, [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization, and Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The utility of the strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost (see scheme).







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence. This sequence consists of three processes: 1)&#8197;interrupted Pummerer reaction to form S&#8722;O&#8208;tethered sulfonium salt; 2)&#8197;C&#8722;C&#8208;forming [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization; and 3)&#8197;Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The present biaryl construction provides a facile access to polyfluorinated biaryls that is difficult to synthesize by other methods. The synthetic utility of the strategy is clearly demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost, a potassium channel modulator.

      <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Carbon&#8208;Bound Boron Difluoride Hydrazone Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron difluoride hydrazone dimers exhibit structurally tunable and sometimes unexpected absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. These findings are rationalized using DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments (see figure).







Abstract
The creation of dimeric boron difluoride complexes of chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is a proven strategy for the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of fluorescent dyes. We report dimers based on the boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) framework, which offer unique and sometimes unexpected substituent&#8208;dependent absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. BODIHY dimers have low&#8208;energy absorption bands (&#955;max=421 to 479&#8197;nm, &#1013;=17&#8201;200 to 39&#8201;900&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) that are red&#8208;shifted relative to monomeric analogues. THF solutions of these dimers exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon addition of water, with emission enhancement factors ranging from 5 to 18. Thin films of BODIHY dimers are weakly emissive as a result of the inner&#8208;filter effect, attributed to intermolecular &#960;&#8208;type interactions. BODIHY dimers are redox&#8208;active and display two one&#8208;electron oxidation and two one&#8208;electron reduction waves that strongly depend on the N&#8208;aryl substituents. These properties are rationalized using density&#8208;functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments.

      <title>Synthesis of 3D IrRuMn Sphere as a Superior Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Acidic Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Spherical electrocatalyst: A spherical IrRuMn catalyst is synthesized through a wet chemical approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional performance for the OER, with an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic media.







Abstract
The design of a three&#8208;dimensional structure for an Ir&#8208;based catalyst offers a great opportunity to improve the electrocatalytic performance and maximize the use of the precious metal. Herein, a novel wet chemical strategy is reported for the synthesis of an IrRuMn catalyst with a sphere structure and porous features. In the synthetic process, the combined use of citric acid and formamide is requisite for the formation of the sphere structure. This method leads to a favorable 3D IrRuMn sphere structure with many fully exposed active sites. Furthermore, an alloying noble metal, such as Ir or Ru, with the transition metal leads to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The doping of a transition metal, such as Mn, is an interesting example, because it exhibits stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline media. For the OER, the IrRuMn sphere catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic 0.1&#8201;m HClO4, which is superior to that of a commercial IrO2/C catalyst. This approach provides a novel way to synthesize an Ir&#8208;based multimetallic spherical electrocatalyst, which exhibits exceptional efficiency for the acidic OER. It will pave the way for new approaches to the practical utilization of PEM electrolyzers.

      <title>FeIII&#8211;Salen&#8208;Based Probes for the Selective and Sensitive Detection of E450 in Foodstuff</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective brightness: A selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe that fluorometrically detects pyrophosphate (alias E450) in baking powder by a disassembly approach is described.







Abstract
Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is considered as a diagnostic marker for various diseases such as cancer and vascular calcification. PPi also plays an important preservative role as an additive E450 in foodstuff. In this work, a selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe for PPi is described; this probe disassembles in the presence of the target analyte into its molecular blocks, 1,2&#8208;propanediamine and 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. The latter signaling unit leads to a fluorometric response. Compared with a related prototype, the new complex shows a 2.3&#8208;times stronger emission at 500&#8197;nm and a 155&#8208;times better selectivity of PPi over adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Importantly, the new probe was successfully applied for detecting E450 in foodstuff.

In this work, a selective Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe for PPi is described; this probe disassembles in the presence of the target analyte into its molecular blocks, 1,2&#8208;propanediamine and 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. The latter signaling unit leads to a fluorometric response. Compared with a related prototype, the new complex shows a 2.3&#8208;times stronger emission at 500&#8197;nm and a 155&#8208;times better selectivity of PPi over adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Importantly, the new probe was successfully applied for detecting E450 in foodstuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Samarium(II) Monoalkyl Complex Supported by a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato&#8208;Based Tetradentate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
A five&#8208;coordinate samarium(II) monoalkyl complex is synthesized and structurally characterized. This complex shows high catalytic activity and high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydrosilylation of various aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes under mild conditions (see scheme).







Abstract
The synthesis and catalytic applications of trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes have been well developed, but the chemistry of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes lagged much behind. Herein, we report the synthesis, structure, and catalytic applications of a samarium(II) monoalkyl complex supported by a &#946;&#8208;diketiminato&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, [LSmCH(SiMe3)2] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(Me)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3). This complex is synthesized by the salt metathesis reaction of samarium iodide [LSm(&#956;&#8208;I)]2 and KCH(SiMe3)2 in 63&#8201;% yield. Its structure is characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing a distorted square&#8208;pyramid coordination geometry. This samarium(II) monoalkyl complex exhibits high catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes, selectively providing the &#945;&#8208;(E) products in high yields.

      <title>Panchromatic Light Harvesting and Stabilizing Charge&#8208; Separated States in Corrole&#8208;Phthalocyanine Conjugates through Coordinating a Subphthalocyanine</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to the electron donating and accepting nature of corroles (Corr) and phthalocyanines (Pc), respectively, we designed and developed two novel covalently linked Corr&#8208;Pc conjugates. The synthetic route allows the preparation of the target conjugates in satisfying yields. Comprehensive steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled insights onto energy and electron transfer processes upon photoexcitation. Coordinating a pyridine&#8208;appended subphthalocyanine (SubPc) to the Pc of the conjugate sets up the ways and means to realize the first example of an array composed by three different porphyrinoids, which drives a cascade of energy and charge transfer processes occur. Importantly, the SubPc assists in stabilizing the charge&#8208;separated state, that is, one&#8208;electron oxidized Corr and the one electron reduced Pc, upon photoexcitation by means of a reductive charge transfer to the SubPc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an intramolecular oxidation of a Corr within electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugates by means of just photoexcitation. Moreover, the combination of Corr, Pc, and SubPc guarantees panchromatic absorption across the visible range of the solar spectrum, with the SubPc covering the &#8220;green gap&#8221; that usually affects porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF and COF Nanosheets: Synthesis and Applications in Electrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials for electrochemistry: Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets represent one promising kind of power materials for electrochemical. Synthesis strategies, tailored material properties and different electrochemical performances are prominent features of supercapacitors, batteries, OER and HER. Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets comprehensively summarized and evaluations are given in this Review.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with unique design principles and various synthesis methods. They are considered ideal electrochemical devices due to the ultrathin thickness, easily tunable molecular structure, large porosity and other unique properties. There are two common methods to synthesize 2D MOF/COF nanosheets: bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down. The top&#8208;down strategy mainly includes ultrasonic assisted exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation and mechanical exfoliation. Another strategy mainly includes interface synthesis, modulation synthesis, surfactant&#8208;assisted synthesis. In this Review, the development of ultrathin 2D nanosheets in the field of electrochemistry (supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution) is introduced, and their unique dimensional advantages are highlighted.

      <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of Hydrazones: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
A new protocol: The first asymmetric catalyzed aza&#8208;Henry reaction of hydrazones is presented. In this process, quinine was used as the catalyst to synthesize a variety of alkyl substituted &#946;&#8208;nitrohydrazides with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;ee. Additionally, experimental and ab initio studies were performed to understand the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
The first asymmetric catalyzed aza&#8208;Henry reaction of hydrazones is presented. In this process, quinine was used as the catalyst to synthesize different alkyl substituted &#946;&#8208;nitrohydrazides with ee up to 77&#8201;%. This ee was improved up to 94&#8201;% by a further recrystallization and the opposite enantiomer can be obtained by using quinidine as the catalyst, opening exciting possibilities in fields in which the control of chirality is vital, such as the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, experimental and ab initio studies were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. The experimental results revealed an unexpected secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) that is explained by the calculated reaction pathway, which shows that the protonation of the initial hydrazone and the C&#8722;C bond forming reaction occur during a concerted process. This concerted mechanism makes the catalysis conceptually different to traditional base&#8208;promoted Henry and aza&#8208;Henry reactions.

      <title>A Thioxanthone Sensitizer with a Chiral Phosphoric Acid Binding Site: Properties and Applications in Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cycloadditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Bind me tender: Cyclic enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids (X=CH2, O) display a binding motif (in blue) for an assembly with chiral acid 1. The acid acts as photocatalyst by transferring the energy of visible photons to the substrate via its thioxanthone substituents (in yellow) enabling an enantioselective [2+2] photocycloaddition (see scheme).







Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid with a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;binaphthol core was prepared that displays two thioxanthone moieties at the 3,3&#8217;&#8208;position as light&#8208;harvesting antennas. Despite its relatively low triplet energy, the phosphoric acid was found to be an efficient catalyst for the enantioselective intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;substituted cyclic enones (e.r. up to 93:7). Binding of the carboxylic acid to the sensitizer is suggested by NMR studies and by DFT calculations to occur by means of two hydrogen bonds. The binding event not only enables an enantioface differentiation but also modulates the triplet energy of the substrates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bind me tender&lt;/b&gt;: Cyclic enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids (X=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O) display a binding motif (in blue) for an assembly with chiral acid &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The acid acts as photocatalyst by transferring the energy of visible photons to the substrate via its thioxanthone substituents (in yellow) enabling an enantioselective [2+2] photocycloaddition (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral phosphoric acid with a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;binaphthol core was prepared that displays two thioxanthone moieties at the 3,3&#8217;&#8208;position as light&#8208;harvesting antennas. Despite its relatively low triplet energy, the phosphoric acid was found to be an efficient catalyst for the enantioselective intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;substituted cyclic enones (e.r. up to 93:7). Binding of the carboxylic acid to the sensitizer is suggested by NMR studies and by DFT calculations to occur by means of two hydrogen bonds. The binding event not only enables an enantioface differentiation but also modulates the triplet energy of the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Direct Enamido C(sp2)&#8722;H Diphosphorylation Enabled by a PCET&#8208;Triggered Double Radical Relay: Access to gem&#8208;Bisphosphonates</title>
      <dc:description>
C&#8722;P bond formation: By taking advantage of a PCET&#8208;triggered radical relay process, a new general method to versatile valuable functionalized gem&#8208;bisphosphonates is described (see scheme).







Abstract
Herein we report a novel and straightforward protocol for the construction of valuable gem&#8208;BPs by means of proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET)&#8208;triggered enamido C(sp2)&#8722;H diphosphorylation. This reaction represents a rare example of realizing the challenging double C&#8722;P bond formation at a single carbon atom, thus providing facile access to a broad variety of structurally diverse bisphosphonates from simple enamides under silver&#8208;mediated conditions. Initial mechanistic studies demonstrated that the diphosphorylation involves two rounds of PCET&#8208;initiated radical relay process.

      <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Polydopamine Formation by Amyloid Fibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Roped together: Inspired by melanin biosynthesis process, amyloid fibers were used to regulate polydopamine formation. The presence of amyloid fibers accelerated polydopamine formation, and the resultant polydopamine&#8211;amyloid composites exhibited different materials properties to those of polydopamine. Amyloids made of different proteins had similar influences on polydopamine formation, indicating that the supramolecular structure is responsible for the observed regulating functions (see scheme).







Abstract
Polydopamine (PD) and melanin species are chemically complex systems, the formation and properties of which are incompletely understood. Inspired by the role of functional amyloids in melanin biosynthesis, this paper examines the influences of the supramolecular structure of amyloids on oxidative polymerization of dopamine. Kinetic analyses on the formation of PD species in the presence of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) fibers or soluble HEWL revealed that both forms gave rise to the total quantity of PD species, but the rate of their formation could be accelerated only by the amyloid form. PD species formed with HEWL fibers showed a morphology of bundled fibers, whereas those with soluble HEWL had a mesh&#8208;like structure. Amyloid fibers of recombinant Pmel17 had properties similar to those of HEWL fibers in modulating PD formation. The results presented here suggest how nature designs functionality with an amyloid structure and can help understand and engineer chemistries of other functional amyloids.

Its open shell nature is associated with partial occupation of non&#8208;jellium, 4d&#8208;type, levels located on the interior of the Pd55 kernel. This shows that the superatom model can be used to rationalize the bonding and stability of spherical ligated group&#8197;10 clusters, despite their apparent 0&#8208;electron count.

Abstract
A new chromium(III) complex, bearing a bis&#8208;thioether&#8208;diphenolate [OSSO]&#8208;type ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst in the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides to achieve poly(propylene carbonate), poly(cyclohexene carbonate), poly(hexene carbonate) and poly(styrene carbonate), as well as poly(propylene carbonate)(cyclohexene carbonate) and poly(propylene carbonate)(hexene carbonate) terpolymers.

The deep understanding of the thermodynamic reasons leading to H&#8208;dimer formation on the surfaces of highly symmetric polyoxometalate nanoclusters is explored and the fundamental way to switch H&#8208; to J&#8208;aggregates by the design of outer shell is uncovered: H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates coexistence in the comb&#8208;like monolayer structure.







Abstract
The induced aggregation of the xanthene dye rhodamine&#8197;B (RhB) on metal oxide centers belonging to the highly symmetric surfaces of precise nanoscale templates with Keplerate (Mo132) or toroidal (Mo138) structures has been studied. With the joint use of the Langmuir isotherm and full Stern&#8211;Volmer models, the thermodynamic reasons for dye adsorption on the nanocluster surface, such as a mixture of monomer, H&#8208;aggregate (H&#8208;dimer), and J&#8208;aggregate forms (which can coexist or switch one into another under the exact conditions), were established: this was shown through UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. By using the framework of the exciton model, it is shown that the angle (&#945;) between the transition dipole moments of RhB is very sensitive to surface strain inside the dye sub&#8208;monolayer. As a result, it is possible to switch from H&#8208; to J&#8208;aggregates by the post&#8208;functionalization of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;RhB associates by the surfactant bilayer shell, which allows the surface strain to grow. Recommendations are provided for managing the appearance of H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregates on metal oxide (or polyelectrolyte) surfaces during photovoltaic or bioimaging applications.

      <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships for the Affinity of Chaotropic Polyoxometalate Anions towards Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and QSAR&#8208;like modeling techniques were applied to establish relationships between the structure of chaotropic polyoxometalate (POM) anions and their affinity towards biological systems. The charge density, size, and shape of POMs were identified as important parameters to balance the POM interactions with the protein and with the solvent (see figure).







Abstract
The influence of the composition of chaotropic polyoxometalate (POM) anions on their affinity to biological systems was studied by means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The variations in the affinity to hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) were analyzed along two series of POMs whereby the charge or the size and shape of the metal cluster are modified systematically. Our simulations revealed a quadratic relationship between the charge of the POM and its affinity to HEWL as a consequence of the parabolic growth of POM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;water interaction with the charge. As the charge increases, POMs become less chaotropic (more kosmotropic) increasing the number and the strength of POM&#8211;water hydrogen bonds and structuring the solvation shell around the POM. This atomistic description explains the proportionally larger desolvation energies and less protein affinity for highly charged POMs, and consequently, the preference for moderate charge densities (q/M=0.33). Also, our simulations suggest that POM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;protein interactions are size&#8208;specific. The cationic pockets of HEWL protein show a preference for Keggin&#8208;like structures, which display the optimal dimensions (&#8776;1&#8197;nm). Finally, we developed a quantitative multidimensional model for protein affinity with predictive ability (r2=0.97; q2=0.88) using two molecular descriptors that account for the charge density (charge per metal atom ratio; q/M) and the size and shape (shape weighted&#8208;volume; VS).

      <title>Bright Luminescent Platinum(II)&#8208;Biaryl Emitters Synthesized Without Air&#8208;Sensitive Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>
Pt complexes made easy: Platinum(II) complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands were synthesized without any air&#8208; or moisture&#8208;sensitive reagents, such as n&#8208;butyllithium. The prepared complexes exhibited intense green emission with high quantum efficiency of up to 0.80, even at 298&#8197;K, because of their tightly packed structure and because of the strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability of the biaryl ligand.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands tend to show intense luminescence. However, difficulties in synthesis have prevented their further functionalization and practical applications. Herein, a series of platinum(II) complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands, which have never been prepared in air, were synthesized through transmetalation and successive cyclometalation of biarylboronic acids. This approach does not require any air&#8208; or moisture&#8208;sensitive reagents and features a simple synthesis even in air. The resulting (Et4N)2[Pt(m,n&#8208;F2bph)(CN)2] (m,n&#8208;F2bph=m,n&#8208;difluorobiphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl) complexes exhibit intense green emissions with high quantum efficiencies of up to 0.80 at 298&#8197;K. The emission spectral fitting and variable&#8208;temperature emission lifetime measurements indicate that the high quantum efficiency was achieved because of the tight packing structure and strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability of bph.

      <title>TMDs beyond MoS2 for Electrochemical Energy Storage
</title>
      <dc:description>
Not just MoS2! A comprehensive Review article on 2D transition metal dichalcogenide based electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices, beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Recent progress, challenges, and research opportunities related to use of TMD electrodes in advanced alkali metal&#8208;ion rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically thin sheets of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted interest as high capacity electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their unique properties (high surface area, high strength and modulus, faster ion diffusion, and so on), which arise from their layered morphology and diversified chemistry. Nevertheless, low electronic conductivity, poor cycling stability, large structural changes during metal&#8208;ion insertion/extraction along with high cost of manufacture are challenges that require further research in order for TMDs to find use in commercial batteries and supercapacitors. Here, a systematic review of cutting&#8208;edge research focused on TMD materials beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide or MoS2 electrode is reported. Accordingly, a critical overview of the recent progress concerning synthesis methods, physicochemical and electrochemical properties is given. Trends and opportunities that may contribute to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research are also discussed.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Quantum Dots using Organic Templates</title>
      <dc:description>
Control over the self&#8208;assembly of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), is a great challenge. In this Minireview, the self&#8208;assemblies of QDs with organic template molecules are highlighted (see figure), which should facilitate future advances in materials science related to assembled QDs.







Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), are regarded as brightly photoluminescent nanomaterials possessing outstanding photophysical properties, such as high photodurability and tunable absorption and emission wavelengths. Therefore, QDs have great potential for a wide range of applications, such as in photoluminescent materials, biosensors and photovoltaic devices. Since the development of synthetic methods for accessing high&#8208;quality QDs with uniform morphology and size, various types of QDs have been designed and synthesized, and their photophysical properties dispersed in solutions and at the single QD level have been reported in detail. In contrast to dispersed QDs, the photophysical properties of assembled QDs have not been revealed, although the structures of the self&#8208;assemblies are closely related to the device performance of the solid&#8208;state QDs. Therefore, creating and controlling the self&#8208;assembly of QDs into well&#8208;defined nanostructures is crucial but remains challenging. In this Minireview, we discuss the notable examples of assembled QDs such as dimers, trimers and extended QD assemblies achieved using organic templates. This Minireview should facilitate future advancements in materials science related to the assembled QDs.

      <title>Enhanced Operational Durability of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a Triazine Electron Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes were fabricated using an electron transport material (ETM) of pT2T. These devices had excellent operational durability, along with low driving voltages and high external quantum efficiencies, when compared with devices with a conventional ETM of T2T. This is because pT2T has higher electron mobility and excellent electrochemical stability than T2T has.

In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on materials that show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), the internal quantum efficiency of 100&#8201;% can be obtained without using phosphorescence&#8208;based organometallics that contain rare metals. Therefore, with TADF&#8208;based emitters, it is possible to fabricate high&#8208;performing OLEDs at a lower cost. However, compared with fluorescence&#8208; and phosphorescence&#8208;based OLEDs, an understanding of degradation mechanisms in TADF&#8208;based OLEDs is still insufficient for future commercialization. In particular, it is widely recognized that the development of electron transport materials is crucial for improving OLED characteristics, especially driving voltages and operational durability. In this study, it was demonstrated that the operational durability of TADF&#8208;based OLEDs was greatly improved by introducing a triazine&#8208;based material of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,3,5]triazine (pT2T) as a hole&#8208;blocking layer (HBL) compared with a conventional HBL material of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,3,5]triazine (T2T). Several experiments were carried out to make the reasons of the improved durability clearer, and attributed the improved durability to the shift of a carrier recombination zone from the emitting layer/HBL interface and the suppressed formation of excited&#8208;state quenchers in the pT2T HBL, because of the higher electron mobility of pT2T and the better stability of its radical anion state.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thermally activated&lt;/b&gt; delayed fluorescence&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes were fabricated using an electron transport material (ETM) of pT2T. These devices had excellent operational durability, along with low driving voltages and high external quantum efficiencies, when compared with devices with a conventional ETM of T2T. This is because pT2T has higher electron mobility and excellent electrochemical stability than T2T has.

      <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation by Ruthenium CNC Pincer Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction using a ruthenium photosensitizer, a sacrificial reagent, and a ruthenium catalyst were carried out. The catalysts contain a pincer ligand, 2,6&#8208;bis(alkylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)pyridine (CNC) and a bipyridine (bpy). The photocatalytic reaction system resulted in HCOOH as a main product (selectivity 70&#8211;80&#8201;%). The carbonyl catalyst with the smaller substituents (Me) reached a turnover number (TONHCOOH)=5634 (24&#8197;h).







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction using a ruthenium photosensitizer, a sacrificial reagent 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BI(OH)H), and a ruthenium catalyst were carried out. The catalysts contain a pincer ligand, 2,6&#8208;bis(alkylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)pyridine (CNC) and a bipyridine (bpy). The photocatalytic reaction system resulted in HCOOH as a main product (selectivity 70&#8211;80&#8201;%), with a small amount of CO, and H2. Comparative experiments (a coordinated ligand (NCMe vs. CO) and substituents (tBu vs. Me) of the CNC ligand in the catalyst) were performed. The turnover number (TONHCOOH) of carbonyl&#8208;ligated catalysts are higher than those of acetonitrile&#8208;ligated catalysts, and the carbonyl catalyst with the smaller substituents (Me) reached TONHCOOH=5634 (24&#8197;h), which is the best performance among the experiments.

      <title>Realization of an Asymmetric Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Battery through Molecular Design to Minimize Active Species Crossover and Decomposition</title>
      <dc:description>
Applied molecular design! This study presents a mechanism&#8208;based approach to the molecular design of electrolytes for implementation in an asymmetric non&#8208;aqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
This communication presents a mechanism&#8208;based approach to identify organic electrolytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). Symmetrical flow cell cycling of a pyridinium anolyte and a cyclopropenium catholyte resulted in extensive capacity fade due to competing decomposition of the pyridinium species. Characterization of this decomposition pathway enabled the rational design of next&#8208;generation anolyte/catholyte pairs with dramatically enhanced cycling performance. Three factors were identified as critical for slowing capacity fade: (1)&#8197;separating the anolyte&#8211;catholyte in an asymmetric flow cell using an anion exchange membrane (AEM); (2)&#8197;moving from monomeric to oligomeric electrolytes to limit crossover through the AEM; and (3)&#8197;removing the basic carbonyl moiety from the anolyte to slow the protonation&#8208;induced decomposition pathway. Ultimately, these modifications led to a novel anolyte&#8211;catholyte pair that can be cycled in an AEM&#8208;separated asymmetric RFB for 96&#8197;h with &gt;95&#8201;% capacity retention at an open circuit voltage of 1.57&#8197;V.

      <title>INPHARMA based determination of ligand binding modes at &#945;1&#8208;adrenergic receptors explains the molecular basis of subtype selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>The structural poses of ligands that bind weakly to protein receptors are challenging to define. In this work we have studied ligand interactions with the adrenoreceptor (AR) subtypes, &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR and &#945;  1B  &#8208;AR which belong to the G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily by employing the solution&#8208;based ligand&#8208;observed NMR method INPHARMA (Interligand Noes for PHARmacophore Mapping). Lack of receptor crystal structures and of subtype&#8208;selective drugs has hindered the definition of the physiological roles of each subtype and limited drug development. We determined the binding pose of the weak binding &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR selective agonist, A&#8208;61603, relative to an endogenous agonist, epinephrine, at both &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR and &#945;  1B  &#8208;AR. The NMR experimental data were quantitatively compared, using SpINPHARMA, to the back&#8208;calculated spectra based on ligand poses obtained from all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations. The results helped mechanistically explain the selectivity of (  R  )&#8208;A&#8208;61603 towards &#945;  1A  &#8208;AR, demonstrating an approach for targeting subtype selectivity in ARs.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;activated protein&#8208;conjugation and 89Zr&#8208;radiolabelling with water&#8208;soluble desferrioxamine derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;conjugates are vital tools in biomedical research, drug discovery and imaging science. For example, functionalised monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) coupled to the desferrioxamine B (DFO) chelate and radiolabelled with 89Zr are used as radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET). In this context, protein functionalisation requires the formation of a covalent bond which must be achieved without compromising the biological properties of the mAb. Photochemistry offers new synthetic routes toward protein&#8208;conjugates like 89Zr&#8208;mAbs but to harness the potential of light&#8208;induced conjugation reactions new photoactivatable reagents are required. Here, we introduce two photoactivatable DFO&#8208;derivatives functionalised with an aryl azide (ArN3) for use in light&#8208;activated conjugation and radiosynthesis of 89Zr&#8208;mAbs. Incorporation of a tris&#8208;polyethylene glycol (PEG)3 linker between DFO and the ArN3 group furnished water&#8208;soluble chelates that were used in the one&#8208;pot, photoradiosynthesis of different 89Zr&#8208;radiolabelled protein&#8208;conjugates with radiochemical yields up to 72.9&#177;1.9%. Notably, the DFO&#8208;PEG3 chelates can be readily synthesised in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), which will facilitate clinical trials with photoradiolabelled 89Zr&#8208;mAbs.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphine functionalized &#223;&#8208;diketimine ligand for the synthesis of manifold metal complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A bis(diphenyl)&#8208;phosphine functionalized  &#223;  &#8208;diketimine (PNac&#8209;H) was synthesized as a flexible ligand for transition metal complexes. The newly designed ligand features symmetrically placed phosphine moieties around a  &#223;  &#8208;diketimine unit, forming a PNNP&#8208;type pocket. Due to the orthogonal donor atoms (N vs. P) the ligand can stabilize various coordination polyhedra. A complete series ranging from coordination numbers 2 to 6 was realized. Linear, trigonal planar, square planar, tetrahedral, square pyramidal, and octahedral coordination arrangements containing the PNac&#8208;ligand around the metal center were observed by using suitable metal sources. Hereby, PNac&#8209;H or its anion PNac  &#8211;  acts as mono&#8208;, bi&#8208; and tetradendate ligand. Such a broad flexibility is unusual for a rigid tetradentate system. The structural motifs were realized by treatment of PNac&#8209;H with a series of late transition metal precursors, e.g. silver, gold, nickel, copper, platinum, and rhodium. The new complexes have been fully characterized by single crystal X&#8209;ray diffraction, NMR, IR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, selected complexes were investigated regarding their photophysical properties. Thus, PNac&#8209;H proved to be an ideal ligand platform for the selective coordination and stabilization of various metal ions in diverse polyhedra and oxidation states.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Binary  pseudo  &#8208;tetrahedral  Zintl  anions composed of (semi&#8208;)metal atoms of the p&#8208;block elements have proven to be excellent starting materials for the synthesis of a variety of heterometallic and intermetalloid transition metal&#8722;main group metal cluster anions.

This brings up the question, whether the other species are generally not achievable, or whether synthetic chemists just did not succeed in their preparation so far. To contribute to a possible answer to this question, we calculated global minimum structures for all anions of the type (TrTt  3  )  5  &#8722;  , (TrPn  3  )  2&#8722;  , and (Tt  2  Pn  2  )  2&#8722;  , comprising elements of periods 3 to 6 (Tr: triel, Al&#183;&#183;&#183;Tl; Tt: tetrel, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb; Pn: pnictogen, P&#183;&#183;&#183;Bi). By analyzing the computational results, we developed a concept to predict which of the yet missing anions should be synthesizable and why. Additionally, we describe molecular structures that would result upon electrophilic attack by protons or trimethylsilyl groups, or upon nucleophilic attack by transition metal complex fragments.

      <title>Salen based conjugated microporous polymers for efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Exploring high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts, especially nonnoble metal electrocatalysts, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical to energy storage and conversion. Herein we report the moiety incorporated conjugated microporous polymer can be used as the OER electrocatalyst with outstanding performances for the first time. The best OER electrocatalyst (Salen&#8208;CMP&#8208;Fe&#8208;3) exhibits a small Tafel slope of 63 mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  and an overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations confirm that the signficant improved electrocatalytic properties is attributed to the salen moeity&#8217;s intrinsic catalytic activativity and enrichment effect of pore structures. This work demonstrates that salen&#8208;based conjugated polymer is the kind of metal&#8208;coordiatnted porous polymer with the excellent performance.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exploring high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts, especially nonnoble metal electrocatalysts, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical to energy storage and conversion. Herein we report the moiety incorporated conjugated microporous polymer can be used as the OER electrocatalyst with outstanding performances for the first time. The best OER electrocatalyst (Salen&#8208;CMP&#8208;Fe&#8208;3) exhibits a small Tafel slope of 63 mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  and an overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations confirm that the signficant improved electrocatalytic properties is attributed to the salen moeity&#8217;s intrinsic catalytic activativity and enrichment effect of pore structures. This work demonstrates that salen&#8208;based conjugated polymer is the kind of metal&#8208;coordiatnted porous polymer with the excellent performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrophoretic Deposition of Binder&#8208;Free MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Films for High&#8208;Performance Microsupercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, miniaturized power supplies have become essential components of micro&#8208;electromechanical systems (MEMS) and micro portable microdevices due to their high&#8208;power density, moderate specific energy, and superior long&#8208;term cyclability. In this study, we successfully fabricate microsupercapacitors with ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbons as active materials  via  electrophoretic deposition method. The carbon materials on microsupercapacitors, which are directly deposited or obtained by pyrolyzing pre&#8208;deposited ZIF&#8208;8 particles, play a crucial role in achieving outstanding electrochemical performances. The microsupercapacitor of 16 interdigital finger electrodes, prepared by electrophoretic deposition of ZIF&#8208;8 particles and subsequent pyrolysis, shows maximum specific power 687.6 mW cm  &#8208;3  , specific energy 2.87 mWh cm  &#8208;3  and 97.8% capacitance retention rate after 10,000 cycles. The simple and facile process of electrophoretic deposition and subsequent pyrolysis of ZIF&#8208;8 particles generates a film of densely populated microporous carbon particles on microsupercapacitor, leading to superior capacitive performances.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the Visible to UV Photodissociation Processes for the PhotoCORM TryptoCORM</title>
      <dc:description>PhotoCORMs are light&#8208;triggered compounds that release CO for medical applications. Here, we apply laser spectroscopy in the gas phase to TryptoCORM, a known photoCORM that has been shown to destroy  Escherichia coli  upon visible&#8208;light activation. Our experiments allow us to map TryptoCORM&#8217;s photochemistry across a wide wavelength range by using novel laser&#8208;interfaced mass spectrometry (LIMS). LIMS provides the intrinsic absorption spectrum of the photoCORM along with the production spectra of all of its ionic photoproducts for the first time. Importantly, the photoproduct spectra directly reveal the optimum wavelengths for maximizing CO ejection, and the extent to which CO ejection is compromised at redder wavelengths. A series of comparative studies were performed on TryptoCORM&#8208;CH  3  CN which exists in dynamic equilibrium with TryptoCORM in solution. Our measurements allow us to conclude that the presence of the labile CH  3  CN facilitates CO release over a wider wavelength range. This work demonstrates the potential of LIMS as a new methodology for assessing active agent release (  e.g.  CO, NO, H  2  S) from light&#8208;activated prodrugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Effects of Amino Group Substitution on the&#160;Photophysical Properties and Stability of&#160;Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent P&#8208;Rhodamines</title>
      <dc:description>A series of phosphine oxide&#8208;bridged rhodamines (P&#8208;rhodamines) bearing various acyclic and cyclic amine moieties, including dimethyl&#8208; and diethylamine, azetidine, pyrrolidine and 7&#8208;azabicyclo[2,2,1]heptane (7ABH), has been synthesized. Photophysical properties as well as chemical and photo&#8208;stability of these dyes have been studied in detail. Among these dyes, 7ABH&#8208;substituted dye shows stronger fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, relative to the other P&#8208;rhodamines. This dye can be applied to live&#8208;cell imaging, where lysosomes were selectively stained in a pH&#8208;independent manner. It was also found that the ring fusion of the amine moieties gives rise to remarkably red&#8208;shifted spectra with the absorption and emission maxima at 770 and 820 nm, respectively, spectrally close to that of indocyanine green (ICG). Importantly, the ring&#8208;fused P&#8208;rhodamines showed much higher photostability than ICG, indicative of their promising utility as the NIR&#8208;emissive dyes.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Propargylic Substitution Reaction of Racemic Secondary Propargylic Alcohols with Thiols</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the significant progress of the enantioselective reaction using chiral catalysts, the enantioselective nucleophilic substitution reaction at the chiral sp 3 &#8208;hybridized carbon atom of a racemic electrophile has not been largely explored. Here, we report the enantioconvergent propargylic substitution reaction of racemic propargylic alcohols with thiols using chiral bis&#8208;phosphoric acid as the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst. The substitution products were formed in high yields with high enantioselectivities in most cases. The cation&#8208;stabilizing effect of the sulfur functional group introduced at the alkynyl terminus is the key to achieving the efficient enantioconvergent process, in which chiral information originating from not only the racemic stereogenic center but also the formed contact ion pair is completely eliminated from the present system.</dc:description>

      <title>The &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dihalocarbonyl Building Blocks: An Avenue for New Reaction Development in Organic Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Versatile building blocks: A summary of the novel and non&#8208;classical synthetic transformations discovered by exploring the novel reactivity of the versatile 1,2&#8208;bifunctional building blocks &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones, for organic synthesis is presented in this Review. It also provides a survey of existing synthetic methods for these building blocks.







Abstract
The &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihalocarbonyl moiety is a bifunctional system with a gem&#8208;dihalocarbon and a carbonyl carbon in 1,2&#8208;fashion. This is one of the privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry due to its chemical and metabolic stability and lipophilicity. They have also been found in numerous structurally divergent natural products and most of their fabricated structures have already been in medicinal use. Apart from their important use in medicinal chemistry, the &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihalocarbonyl groups have been employed as key building blocks for the development of novel synthetic strategies and utilized as intermediates in total synthesis. In addition to the traditional transformations such as oxidations, reductions, and C&#8722;C bond formations, recently several new and non&#8208;classical reactions have also been developed. This review provides short description of existing methods for their synthesis and detailed discussion on the efforts for the discovery and development of new reactions by employing &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones as synthetic building blocks. We have presented their use as key functional groups for the synthesis of polycyclic systems of medicinal and material importance and natural products.

Biochemical, cellular and structural studies on Fapy&#8901;dG have been hampered due to difficulties in synthesizing oligonucleotides containing this lesion.

Abstract
N6&#8208;(2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;erythropentofuranosyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (Fapy&#8901;dG) is a major DNA lesion produced from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine under oxidizing conditions. Fapy&#8901;dG is produced from a common intermediate that leads to 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (8&#8208;OxodGuo), and in greater quantities in cells. The impact of Fapy&#8901;dG on DNA structure and function is much less well understood than that of 8&#8208;OxodGuo. This is largely due to the significantly greater difficulty in synthesizing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&#8901;dG than 8&#8208;OxodGuo. We describe a synthetic approach for preparing oligonucleotides containing Fapy&#8901;dG that will facilitate intensive studies of this lesion in DNA. A variety of oligonucleotides as long as 30&#8197;nucleotides are synthesized. We anticipate that the chemistry described herein will provide an impetus for a wide range of studies involving Fapy&#8901;dG.

      <title>Triple Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Type Reactivity on a Single Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Center</title>
      <dc:description>
Ce/P FLP: The first Ce/P frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) system was synthesized by the reaction of heptadentate N4P3 ligand with Ce[N(TMS)2]3. This Ce/P species exhibits triple FLP&#8208;type reactivity towards a series of heteroallenes, including isocyanates, isothiocyanates, diazomethane, and organic azides under mild conditions.







Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth metal cations have been used rarely as Lewis&#8208;acidic components in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). Herein, we report the first cerium/phosphorus system (2) employing a heptadentate N4P3 ligand, which exhibits triple FLP&#8208;type reactivity towards a series of organic substrates, including isocyanates, isothiocyanates, diazomethane, and azides on a single rare&#8208;earth Lewis acidic Ce center. This result shows that the Ce center and three P atoms in 2 could simultaneously activate three equivalents of small molecules under mild conditions. This study broadens the diversity of FLPs and demonstrates that rare earth based FLP exhibit unique properties compared with other FLP systems.

      <title>N&#8208;Doped Graphdiyne Coating for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY) is used to improve the nucleation and plating process of metallic Li on the Cu substrate. With the lithiophilic nanofilms, the NGDY@Cu nanowire (NW) electrode exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and significant improvements in terms of coulombic efficiency and lifespan.







Abstract
Nonuniform nucleation is one of the major reasons for the dendric growth of metallic lithium, which leads to intractable problems in the efficiency, reversibility, and safety in Li&#8208;based batteries. To improve the deposition of metallic Li on Cu substrates, herein, a freestanding current collector (NGDY@CuNW) is formed by coating pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY) nanofilms on 3D Cu nanowires (CuNWs). Theoretical predictions reveal that the introduction of nitrogen atoms in the 2D GDY can enhance the binding energy between the Li atom and GDY, therefore improving the lithiophilicity on the surface for uniform lithium nucleation and deposition. Accordingly, the deposited metallic Li on the NGDY@CuNW electrode exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology, resulting in significant improvements in terms of the reversibility with a high coulombic efficiency (CE) and a long lifespan at high current density. Our research provides an efficient method to control the surface property of Cu, which also will be instructive for other metal batteries.

      <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I)&#8211;Aryl Complexes: Expanded Scope and Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Gilded arylation: Methods for the transmetallation of organoboranes to gold(I) centers allow for the synthesis of a plethora of organogold complexes. The scalability of the synthetic methods, in combination with a diversity of reactivity, sets the stage for the use of these complexes in catalytic and synthetic applications (see scheme).







Abstract
The discovery of sustainable and scalable synthetic protocols leading to gold&#8211;aryl compounds bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands sparked an investigation of their reactivity and potential utility as organometallic synthons. The use of a mild base and green solvents provide access to these compounds, starting from widely available boronic acids and various [Au(NHC)Cl] complexes, with reactions taking place under air, at room temperature and leading to high yields with unprecedented ease. One compound, (N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)gold, ([Au(IPr)(4&#8208;MeOC6H4)]), was synthesized on a multigram scale and used to gauge the reactivity of this class of compounds towards C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bonds and with various acids, revealing simple pathways to gold&#8211;based species that possess attractive properties as materials, reagents and/or catalysts.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions with Cp*MIII catalysts (M=Co, Rh, Ir) have found a wide variety of applications in organic synthesis. Albeit the intrinsic difficulties in achieving catalytic stereocontrol using these catalysts due to their lack of additional coordination sites for external chiral ligands and the conformational flexibility of the Cp ligand, catalytic enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using the Group&#8197;9 metal triad with Cp&#8208;type ligands have been intensively studied since 2012. In this minireview, the progress in these reactions according to the type of the chiral catalyst used are summarized and discussed.

      <title>Turning Cell Adhesions ON or OFF with High Spatiotemporal Precision using the Green Light Responsive Protein CarH</title>
      <dc:description>Spatiotemporal control of integrin&#8208;mediated cell adhesions to extracellular matrix regulates cell behavior with has numerous implications for biotechnological applications. Herein, we report two approaches for regulating cell adhesions in space and time with high precision both of which utilize green light. In the first design, CarH, which is a tetramer in the dark, is used to mask cRGD adhesion&#8208;peptides on a surface. Upon green light illumination, the CarH tetramer dissociates into its monomers, revealing the adhesion peptide so that cells can adhere. In the second design, the RGD motif is incorporated into the CarH protein tetramer such that cells can adhere to surfaces functionalized with this protein. The cell adhesions can be disrupted with green light, due to the disassembly of the CarH&#8208;RGD protein. Both designs allow for photoregulation with noninvasive visible light and open new possibilities to investigate the dynamical regulation of cell adhesions in cell biology.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal control of integrin&#8208;mediated cell adhesions to extracellular matrix regulates cell behavior with has numerous implications for biotechnological applications. Herein, we report two approaches for regulating cell adhesions in space and time with high precision both of which utilize green light. In the first design, CarH, which is a tetramer in the dark, is used to mask cRGD adhesion&#8208;peptides on a surface. Upon green light illumination, the CarH tetramer dissociates into its monomers, revealing the adhesion peptide so that cells can adhere. In the second design, the RGD motif is incorporated into the CarH protein tetramer such that cells can adhere to surfaces functionalized with this protein. The cell adhesions can be disrupted with green light, due to the disassembly of the CarH&#8208;RGD protein. Both designs allow for photoregulation with noninvasive visible light and open new possibilities to investigate the dynamical regulation of cell adhesions in cell biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reversible Photoswitching in Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Nanoreactors</title>
      <dc:description>This contribution reports light responsive catalytic nanoreactors based on poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymers. The hydrophobic block of the copolymer is a random copolymer consisting of a spiropyran functionalized 2&#8208;oxazoline (SPOx) and 2&#8208;(but&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazole (ButynOx), while the hydrophilic block is based on 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (MeOx). The block copolymer is terminated with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl) amine (TREN) that serves as catalyst in a Knoevenagel condensation. Four block copolymers with different ButynOx/SPOx and hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios are synthesized and self&#8208;assembled through solvent exchange. Micelles and vesicles of various sizes are observed by TEM, which undergo morphological and size changes in response to irradiation with UV light. We hypothesize that these transformations in the nanostructures are caused by increases in the hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic block when spiropyran (SP) isomerizes to merocyanine (MC) in the presence of UV light. The reversible transition from micellar to vesicular nanoreactors resulted in increased reaction kinetics through improved substrate accessibility to the catalytic site, or termination of the catalytic reaction due to polymer precipitation. These nanoreactors present a promising platform towards photoregulating reaction outcomes based on changes in nanostructure morphology.</dc:description>

      <title>Vanadium&#8208;manganese redox flow battery: Study of Mn(III) disproportionation in the presence of other metallic ions.</title>
      <dc:description>The Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox couple with a standard potential of +1.51 V  vs  . SHE has drawn interest for the design of V/Mn redox flow battery (RFB). However, Mn(III) disproportionation leads to a loss of capacity, an increase of pressure drop and electrode passivation due to the formation of MnO  2  during battery cycling. In this work, we studied the influence of Ti(IV) or/and V(V) on Mn(III) stability in acidic conditions, by formulating 4 different electrolytes at equimolar ratios (Mn, Mn:Ti, Mn:V, Mn:V:Ti). Voltammetric studies have revealed a EC  i  process for Mn(II) oxidation responsible for the electrode passivation. SEM and XPS analysis demonstrate that the nature and the morphology of the passivating oxides layer strongly rely on the electrolyte composition. Spectroelectrochemistry highlights the stabilization effect of Ti(IV) and V(V) on Mn(III). At a comparable pH, the amount of Mn(III) losses through disproportionation is decreased by a factor of 2.5 in the presence of Ti(IV) or/and V(V). V(V) is an efficient substitute to Ti(IV) in order to stabilize Mn(III) electrolyte for redox flow battery applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermal Decomposition of Ternary Sodium Graphite Intercalation Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
Producing graphene: Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent.

Abstract
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Detailed comparisons of in situ temperature dependent XRD with TGA&#8208;MS and Raman measurements reveal a series of dynamic transformations during heating. Surprisingly, the bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene sheets. The heating process drives a reorganisation of the solvent and Na molecules, then an evaporation of the solvent; however, the solvent loss is arrested by restacking of the graphene layers, leading to trapped solvent bubbles. Eventually, the bubbles rupture, releasing the remaining solvent and creating expanded graphite. These trapped dopants may provide useful property enhancements, but also potentially confound measurements of grafting efficiency in liquid&#8208;phase covalent functionalization experiments on 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Detailed comparisons of in situ temperature dependent XRD with TGA&#8208;MS and Raman measurements reveal a series of dynamic transformations during heating. Surprisingly, the bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene sheets. The heating process drives a reorganisation of the solvent and Na molecules, then an evaporation of the solvent; however, the solvent loss is arrested by restacking of the graphene layers, leading to trapped solvent bubbles. Eventually, the bubbles rupture, releasing the remaining solvent and creating expanded graphite. These trapped dopants may provide useful property enhancements, but also potentially confound measurements of grafting efficiency in liquid&#8208;phase covalent functionalization experiments on 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chemical Functionalisation of 2D Materials by Batch and Continuous Hydrothermal Flow Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Functionalising 2D materials: In this Minireview, the authors present batch and continuous hydrothermal synthesis of a selection of 2D derivatives (graphene, MXene and molybdenum disulfide), their chemical functionalisation as an advantageous approach in exploring properties of these materials as well as the benefits and challenges of employing these processes, and an outlook for further research.







Abstract
2D materials are single or few layered materials consisting of one or several elements with a thickness of a few nanometres. Their unique, tuneable physical and chemical properties including ease of chemical functionalisation makes this class of materials useful in a variety of technological applications. The feasibility of 2D materials strongly depends on better synthetic approaches to improve properties, increase performance, durability and reduce costs. As such, in the synthesis of nanomaterials, hydrothermal processes are widely adopted through a precursor&#8211;product synthesis route. This method includes batch or continuous flow systems, both employing water at elevated temperatures (above boiling point) and pressures to fine&#8208;tune the physical, chemical, optical and electronic properties of the nanomaterial. Both techniques yield particles with different morphology, size and surface area due to different mechanisms of particle formation. In this Minireview, we present batch and continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis of a selection of 2D derivatives (graphene, MXene and molybdenum disulfide), their chemical functionalisation as an advantageous approach in exploring properties of these materials as well as the benefits and challenges of employing these processes, and an outlook for further research.

      <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Alumination of Terminal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rare earths team up with main&#8208;group elements: Alkynylaluminum compounds are synthesized directly from terminal alkynes and abundant, inexpensive trialkylaluminum reagents through catalytic C&#8722;H bond functionalization using rare&#8208;earth aluminate compounds, in contrast to transition&#8208;metal complexes which catalyze carboaluminations. A saturated lanthanide aluminate adduct, implicated by kinetic studies, provides a rationale for C&#8722;H bond alumination occurring rather than addition.







Abstract
Organoaluminum reagents&#8217; application in catalytic C&#8722;H bond functionalization is limited by competitive side reactions, such as carboalumination and hydroalumination. Herein, rare&#8208;earth tetramethylaluminate complexes are shown to catalyze the exclusive C&#8722;H bond metalation of terminal alkynes with the commodity reagents trimethyl&#8208;, triethyl&#8208;, and triisobutylaluminum. Kinetic experiments probing alkyl&#8208;group exchange between rare&#8208;earth aluminates and trialkylaluminum, C&#8722;H bond metalation of alkynes, and catalytic conversions reveal distinct pathways of catalytic aluminations with triethylaluminum versus trimethylaluminum. Most significantly, kinetic data point to reversible formation of a unique [Ln](AlR4)2&#8901;AlR3 adduct, followed by turnover&#8208;limiting alkyne metalation. That is, C&#8722;H bond activation occurs from a more associated organometallic species, rather than the expected coordinatively unsaturated species. These mechanistic conclusions allude to a new general strategy for catalytic C&#8722;H bond alumination that make use of highly electrophilic metal catalysts.

      <title>Solution Conformations Explain the Chameleonic Behaviour of Macrocyclic Drugs</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular chameleons: NMR spectroscopy and computational studies reveal that macrocyclic drugs in the beyond rule of 5 chemical space behave as molecular chameleons. This allows them to adapt to the environment and combine otherwise conflicting properties including aqueous solubility, cell permeability and target binding.







Abstract
It has been hypothesised that drugs in the chemical space &#8220;beyond the rule of 5&#8221; (bRo5) must behave as molecular chameleons to combine otherwise conflicting properties, including aqueous solubility, cell permeability and target binding. Evidence for this has, however, been limited to the cyclic peptide cyclosporine&#8197;A. Herein, we show that the non&#8208;peptidic and macrocyclic drugs roxithromycin, telithromycin and spiramycin behave as molecular chameleons, with rifampicin showing a less pronounced behaviour. In particular roxithromycin, telithromycin and spiramycin display a marked, yet limited flexibility and populate significantly less polar and more compact conformational ensembles in an apolar than in a polar environment. In addition to balancing of membrane permeability and aqueous solubility, this flexibility also allows binding to targets that vary in structure between species. The drugs&#8217; passive cell permeability correlates to their 3D polar surface area and corroborate two theoretical models for permeability, developed for cyclic peptides. We conclude that molecular chameleonicity should be incorporated in the design of orally administered drugs in the bRo5 space.

      <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Seeding as a Strategy for Fabrication of Densely Packed Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (SURMOF) Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
Insights from in situ and ex situ investigation on the concentration dependency of the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) growth of metal&#8211;organic frameworks on surfaces markedly improve control of the LbL process. Even at reduced cycle numbers, by varying reactant concentrations, densely packed yet thin films could be produced, which are highly desired for various applications.







Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) method is a well&#8208;established method for the growth of surface&#8208;attached metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs). Various experimental parameters, such as surface functionalization or temperature, have been identified as essential in the past. In this study, inspired by these recent insights regarding the LbL SURMOF growth mechanism, the impact of reactant solutions concentration on LbL growth of the Cu2(F4bdc)2(dabco) SURMOF (F4bdc2&#8722;=tetrafluorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate and dabco=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octane) in situ by using quartz&#8208;crystal microbalance and ex situ with a combination of spectroscopic, diffraction and microscopy techniques was investigated. It was found that number, size, and morphology of MOF crystallites are strongly influenced by the reagent concentration. By adjusting the interplay of nucleation and growth, we were able to produce densely packed, yet thin films, which are highly desired for a variety of SURMOF applications.

      <title>Synthesis, Modification, and Biological Evaluation of a Library of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Thiopyridone&#8208;Based Organometallic Complexes and Their Unexpected (Biological) Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemical concerto: Thiopyridone&#8208;based piano&#8208;stool complexes undergo dimerization in polar protic solvents. The resulting dimers (featuring a double positive charge) were studied for their effects in cancer cells.







Abstract
A series of 16 dinuclear thiopyridone&#8208;based organometallics with excellent water solubility, increased stability and remarkable cytotoxicity were synthesized and characterized. The complexes of this work formed dimeric species featuring a double positive charge in polar protic solvents, accounting for their outstanding solubility in aqueous solution. Most of them displayed higher antiproliferative activity than their parental thiomaltol complex, with unexpected cytotoxicity trends depending on the employed metal center, ligand modification, and cell line. Insights into their behavior in biological systems were gathered by means of amino&#8208;acid interaction studies, cytotoxicity tests in 3D spheroid models, laser ablation, cellular accumulation measurements, as well as cell cycle experiments.

      <title>Structural Peculiarities and Thermoelectric Study of Iron Indium Thiospinel</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron indium thiospinel: Two different mechanisms for the Fe incorporation into indium thiospinel were investigated, namely the charge&#8208;balanced (A1) and the charge&#8208;unbalanced (A2) series. The Fe content (i.e., vacancy concentration) strongly influences the unit cell parameter, charge carrier concentration, charge carrier mobility, as well as thermal conductivity (&#954;tot) in both series.







Abstract
The homogeneity range of ternary iron indium thiospinel at 873&#8197;K was investigated. A detailed study was focused on two distinct series (y=z): 1)&#8197;a previously reported charge&#8208;balanced (In0.67+0.33y&#9633;0.33&#8722;0.33y)tetr[In2&#8722;zFez]octS4 (A1&#8208;series; &#9633; stands for vacancy; the abbreviations &#8220;tetr&#8221; and &#8220;oct&#8221; indicate atoms occupying tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites, respectively) and 2)&#8197;a new charge&#8208;unbalanced (In0.67+y&#9633;0.33&#8722;y)tetr[In2&#8722;zFez]octS4 (A2&#8208;series). Fe atoms were confirmed to exclusively occupy an octahedral position in both series. An unusual reduction of the unit cell parameter with increasing Fe content is explained by differences in the ionic radii between Fe and In, as well as by an additional electrostatic attraction originating from charge imbalance (latter only in A2&#8208;series). The studied compound is an n&#8208;type semiconductor, and its charge carrier concentration increases or decreases for larger Fe content within the A1&#8208; and A2&#8208;series, respectively. The thermal conductivity &#954;tot is significantly reduced upon increasing vacancy concentration, whereas the change of power factor is insufficient to drastically improve the thermoelectric figure of merit.

      <title>Earth&#8208;Abundant Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent fascinating works are summarized that focus on several promising strategies to promote electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting, such as chemical doping, defect (vacancy) engineering, phase engineering, facet engineering, and structural engineering. Finally, the potential for further development in rational electrode materials design is also discussed.







Abstract
The depletion of fossil fuels has accelerated the search for clean, sustainable, scalable, and environmentally friendly alternative energy sources. Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier because of its advantageous properties, and the electrolysis of water is considered as an efficient method for its industrial production. However, the high&#8208;energy conversion efficiency of electrochemical water splitting requires cost&#8208;effective and highly active electrocatalysts. Therefore, researchers have aimed to develop high&#8208;performance electrode materials based on non&#8208;precious and abundant transition metals for conversion devices. Moreover, to further reduce the cost and complexity in real&#8208;world applications, bifunctional catalysts that can be simultaneously active on both the anodic (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and cathodic (i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) sides are economically and technically desirable. This Minireview focuses on the recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts, including several promising strategies to promote electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting in alkaline media, such as chemical doping, defect (vacancy) engineering, phase engineering, facet engineering, and structure engineering.

      <title>Fundamental Insights into the Covalent Silane Functionalization of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Silane grafting: NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were covalently functionalized with using (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules by using a procedure involving a topochemical synthetic approach and an anion exchange process. In the graphic, NiFe&#8208;APTES LDHs are represented by showing the two phases that form the second&#8208;staging interstratified compound which combines the bilayer arrangement of dodecyl sulphate molecules and the APTES covalent grafting.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of 2D anionic materials exhibiting wide chemical versatility and promising applications in different fields, ranging from catalysis to energy storage and conversion. However, the covalent chemistry of this kind of 2D materials is still barely explored. Herein, the covalent functionalization with silanes of a magnetic NiFe&#8208;LDH is reported. The synthetic route consists of a topochemical approach followed by anion exchange reaction with surfactant molecules prior to covalent functionalization with the (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules. The functionalized NiFe&#8208;APTES was fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry and 29Si solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, among others. The effect on the electronic properties of the functionalized LDH was investigated by a magnetic study in combination with M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Moreover, the reversibility of the silane&#8208;functionalization at basic pH was demonstrated, and the quality of the resulting LDH was proven by studying the electrochemical performance in the oxygen evolution reaction in basic media. Furthermore, the anion exchange capability for the NiFe&#8208;APTES was tested employing CrVI, resulting in an increase of 200&#8201;% of the anion retention. This report allows for a new degree of tunability of LDHs, opening the door to the synthesis of new hybrid architectures and materials.

      <title>Aqueous Synthesis of Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles for Synergistic In Vitro and In Vivo Photothermal Chemotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple and one&#8208;step synthetic approach that allows the preparation of well&#8208;defined and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use water&#8208;soluble TPP&#8208;AuNPs is described.

Abstract
Triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface&#8208;functionalized and F&#8208;108 Pluronic&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs) have been synthesized through a one&#8208;step approach, leading to well&#8208;defined (9.6&#177;1.6&#8197;nm) and water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles by microwave heating an aqueous solution of TPP&#8208;AuICl in the presence of a Pluronic polymer under basic conditions. TPP release was negligible under physiological conditions, but enhanced significantly at an acidic pH (5.4) mimicking that of a cancer cell. Laser irradiation (532&#8197;nm) raised the temperature of an aqueous solution of F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs to 51.7&#8201;&#176;C within 5&#8197;min, confirming efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion capabilities without significant photodegradation. TEM confirmed intracellular localization of F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs in the cytosol, endosomes and lysosomes of HeLa cells. F&#8208;108@TPP&#8208;AuNPs were well tolerated by HeLa cells and zebrafish embryos at ambient temperatures and became toxic upon heat activation, suggesting synergistic interactions between heat and cytotoxic action by TPP.
