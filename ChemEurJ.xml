      <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;LDHs have been deemed as a benchmark non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, for NiFe&#8208;LDHs laminate, the edge sites are active, but the basal plane is inert, leading to underutilization for the OER catalysts. Herein, it is the first time to intercalate the light and electron&#8208;deficient Li ion into NiFe&#8208;LDHs basal plane. The results of theoretical calculation and experiment both showed that the electron would transfer from near Ni  2+  to the surrounding of Li  +  , resulting in the electron&#8208;deficient properties of Ni site would work as &#8220;electron&#8208;hungry&#8221; sites to enhance surface adsorption of electron&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing group, which would benefit to enhance the effective active for OER. Demonstrated with catalytic performance, the Li&#8208;NiFe&#8208;LDHs electrodes showed ultralow overpotential only 298 mV at 50 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which was lower than that of 347 mV for initial NiFe&#8208;LDHs, and also lower than that of 373 mV for RuO  2  . The reasonable intercalation adjustment effectively activate laminate Ni  2+  sites and constructs the electron&#8208;deficiency structure to enhance its electrocatalytic activity, which sheds light on the development for functional treatment of catalytic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f = 2.9 vs 0.02%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced&#160;fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photoinduced charge separation in supramolecular aggregates of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules is a fundamental photophysical process, and a key criterion for the development of advanced organic electronics materials. Here, we report on the self&#8208;assembly of novel low&#8208;bandgap chromophores into helical one&#8208;dimensional aggregates due to intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding.

      <dc:description>The use of organometallic triplet emitters in OLEDs is motivated by the premise of efficient intersystem crossing leading to unit internal quantum efficiencies. However, since most devices are based on solid&#8208;state components, an inherent limitation to square planar platinum(II) phosphors is their tendency toward aggregation&#8208;based quenching. &#160;We introduce a new class of emissive, four&#8208;coordinate Pt(II) species based on the bisimidazolyl carbazolide (BIMCA) ligand that display highly efficient, long&#8208;lived solid&#8208;state phosphorescence at room temperature. As examples, a set of four BIMCAPt phenyl acetylides are synthesized that emit in the green (l  max  = 507&#8208;540 nm) with &gt;60% quantum yield and millisecond lifetimes. The structures of the resulting species reveal a non&#8208;planar structure imposed by steric clashes between BIMCA and the iodo or alkynyl coligand. Ground&#8208;state and photophysical characterization are presented. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate that the BIMCA ligand dominates the frontier orbitals along with the first Franck&#8208;Condon singlet and triplet excited states.</dc:description>

      <title>Optically triggered control of the charge carrier density  in chemically functionalized graphene field effect transistors</title>
      <dc:description>Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules.

Under exposure with 365 nm and 455 nm light, azobenzene molecules undergo  cis  and  trans  molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment.

Abstract
This work presents a stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron transfer induced hydrogen shift leading to the conversion of a bis&#8208;pyrrolinium cation to an E&#8208;diaminoalkene and vice versa. Remarkably, the forward and the reverse reaction, which are both reversible, follow two completely different reaction pathways. Establishing such unprecedented property in this type of processes was possible by developing a novel synthetic route towards the starting dication. All intermediates involved in both the forward and the backward reactions were comprehensively characterized by a combination of spectroscopic, crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and theoretical methods. The presented synthetic route opens up new possibilities for the generation of multi&#8208;pyrrolinium cation scaffold&#8208;based organic redox systems, which constitute decidedly sought&#8208;after molecules in contemporary chemistry.

      <title>Interception of Elusive Cationic Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn Heterobimetallic Adducts with Mixed Alkyl Bridges Featuring Multiple Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
To bond to natural terrains, animals employ diverse adaptions: prehensile tails, suction&#8208;cup toes, zygodactyl claws. Molecular bonding can also be nuanced; unraveling such mysteries is at the heart of chemistry. A series of Hf/Al, Hf/Zn complexes is bound by multiple agostic interactions from bridging alkyls and has short Hf&#8211;Al/Zn interatomic distances. One can envision agostic hydrogen atoms grasping the Hf center like toes, the electron cloud of Al/Zn brushing against it like a tail.

      <title>Luminescence&#8208;Driven Electronic Structure Determination in a Textbook Dimeric DyIII&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
      <dc:description>
Shine on: A dysprosium dinuclear complex textbook example is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of crystal field theory. This historical theory coupled with Boltzmann population allows the extraction of the energy spectrum of the ground state multiplet from luminescence that is used to model the magnetic properties.







Abstract
A textbook dysprosium dinuclear complex based on acetylacetone ligands, [Dy2(acac)4(&#956;2&#8208;acac)2(H2O)2], has been synthesized and fully characterized. This simple dimeric lanthanide complex shows well&#8208;resolved solid&#8208;state luminescence and behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet under zero DC field. A seminal crystal&#8208;field approach is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of an energetic picture.

It was found that number, size and morphology of MOF crystallites are strongly influenced by the reagent concentration. By adjusting the interplay of nucleation and growth, we were able to produce densely packed, yet thin films, which are highly desired for a variety of SURMOF applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Control over the Aspect Ratio of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Recent developments in kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization permit control of the size (length and area) of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. However, control of molecular self&#8208;assembly at a level comparable with organic synthetic chemistry and the achievement of structural complexity at a hierarchy larger than the molecular level remain challenging. In this study, we focus on controlling the aspect ratio of supramolecular nanosheets. A systematic understanding of the relationship between the monomer structure and the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape has derived a new monomer capable of forming supramolecular nanosheets. Having this monomer in hand, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of a supramolecular nanosheet can be controlled by modulating intermolecular interactions in two dimensions.</dc:description>

For comparison, a series of  PTZ  derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) (cyano &#8208;CN and formyl &#8208;CHO) and electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) (methoxy &#8208;OMe) group at C3&#8208;position were designed and synthesized.

Computational approaches unveil that for  PTZ  and  PTZ&#8208;OMe  , the transitions are from HOMOs dominated by &#960; orbitals to LUMOs of sulphur nonbonding&#8208;mixed &#960;* orbitals, and hence are partially forbidden. On the contrary, the EWGs lower the energy level of lone pair electrons on the sulphur atom, suppressing the mixing of nonbonding orbital with &#960;* in LUMO such that the allowed &#960;&#960;* transition becomes dominant. This work thus demonstrates a judicious chemical design to fine&#8208;tune the transition character in  PTZ  analogues, making  PTZ&#8208;NO  2  attains unity emission quantum yield in nonpolar solvents.</dc:description>

      <title>Functionalization of Piperidine Derivatives for the Site&#8208;Selective and Stereoselective Synthesis of Positional Analogues of Methylphenidate</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention, please: Regio, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 functionalization on piperidine ring controlled by catalysts and protecting groups has been employed for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate (Ritalin).







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertions and cyclopropanations of donor/acceptor carbenes have been used for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate. The site selectivity is controlled by the catalyst and the amine protecting group. C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TCPTAD)4, or N&#8208;brosyl&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TPPTTL)4 generated 2&#8208;substitited analogues. In contrast, when N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;oxoarylacetyl&#8208;piperidines were used in combination with Rh2(S&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;BrTPCP)4, the C&#8722;H functionalization produced 4&#8208;susbstiuted analogues. Finally, the 3&#8208;substituted analogues were prepared indirectly by cyclopropanation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;tetrahydropyridine followed by reductive regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanes.

      <title>Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalyzed by Ru Nanocatalysts: Labelling of Complex Molecules Containing N&#8208;Heterocycles and Reaction Mechanism Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D2 or T2 gas as isotopic sources. In terms of application, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms allows the synthesis of deuterated internal standards for LC/MS quantification and the efficacy of the catalytic process permits the preparation of complex radiolabelled drugs owning high specific activities by using a subatmospheric pressure of T2 gas.







Abstract
Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D2 or T2 gas as isotopic sources. Depending on the substructure considered, this approach does not only represent a significant step forward in practice, with notably higher isotope uptakes, a broader substrate scope and a higher solvent applicability compared to existing procedures, but also the unique way to label important heterocycles using hydrogen isotope exchange. In terms of applications, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms, allows the synthesis of internal standards for LC&#8208;MS quantification. Moreover, the efficacy of the catalyst permits, even under subatmospheric pressure of T2 gas, the preparation of complex radiolabeled drugs owning high molar activities. From a fundamental point of view, a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic study identifying undisclosed key intermediates, allowed a deeper understanding of C&#8722;H (and N&#8722;H) activation processes occurring at the surface of metallic nanoclusters.

      <title>Radical C&#8722;N Borylation of Aromatic Amines Enabled by a Pyrylium Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>
A radical borylation of aromatic amines through a homolytic C(sp2)&#8722;N bond cleavage is presented. This method capitalizes on a simple and mild activation via a pyrylium reagent (ScPyry&#8208;OTf) that primes the amino group for reactivity. The combination of terpyridine and a diboron reagent triggers a radical reaction which cleaves the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond and forges a new C(sp2)&#8722;B bond. The non&#8208;planar structure of the pyridinium, provides the necessary driving force for the challenging aryl radical formation.

This method capitalizes on a simple and mild activation via a pyrylium reagent (ScPyry&#8208;OTf) thus priming the amino group for reactivity. The combination of terpyridine and a diboron reagent triggers a radical reaction which cleaves the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond and forges a new C(sp2)&#8722;B bond. The unique non&#8208;planar structure of the pyridinium intermediate, provides the necessary driving force for the aryl radical formation. The method permits borylation of a wide variety of aromatic amines indistinctively of the electronic environment.

      <title>Optical Control of Cytokine Production Using Photoswitchable Galactosylceramides</title>
      <dc:description>
A new direction in photoimmunotherapy: The synthesis and biological evaluation of photochromic derivatives of the &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide KRN&#8208;7000 are reported. The photolipid &#945;&#8208;GalACer&#8208;4 proved to be more potent than KRN&#8208;7000 itself when activated with 370&#8197;nm light (see scheme).







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramides are glycosphingolipids that show promise in cancer immunotherapy. After presentation by CD1d, they activate natural killer T cells (NKT), which results in the production of a variety of pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of photochromic derivatives of KRN&#8208;7000, the activity of which can be modulated with light. Based on established structure&#8211;activity relationships, we designed photoswitchable analogues of this glycolipid that control the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN&#8208;&#947;. The azobenzene derivative &#945;&#8208;GalACer&#8208;4 proved to be more potent than KRN&#8208;7000 itself when activated with 370&#8197;nm light. Photolipids of this type could improve our mechanistic understanding of cytokine production and could open new directions in photoimmunotherapy.

      <title>Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling between Phenols and &#946;&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Facile Construction of Benzofurans</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrifying: A mild electrochemical system was developed for the preparation of benzofurans through cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This method has good functional&#8208;group compatibility and can serve as a powerful synthetic tool with high synthetic value.







Abstract
Preparative electrochemical synthesis is an ideal method for establishing green, sustainable processes. The major benefits of an electro&#8208;organic strategy over that of conventional chemical synthesis are the avoidance of reagent waste and mild reaction conditions. Here, an intermolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been developed to build various benzofurans under undivided electrolytic conditions. Neither transition metals nor external chemical oxidants are required to facilitate the dehydrogenation and dehydration processes. The key factor in success was the use of nBu4NBF4 as the electrolyte and hexafluoroisopropanol as the solvent, which play key roles in the cyclocondensation step. This electrolysis is scalable and can be used as a key step in drug synthesis. On the basis of several experimental results, the mechanism, particularly of the remarkable anodic oxidation and cyclization process, was illustrated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electrifying&lt;/b&gt;: A mild electrochemical system was developed for the preparation of benzofurans through cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This method has good functional&#8208;group compatibility and can serve as a powerful synthetic tool with high synthetic value.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparative electrochemical synthesis is an ideal method for establishing green, sustainable processes. The major benefits of an electro&#8208;organic strategy over that of conventional chemical synthesis are the avoidance of reagent waste and mild reaction conditions. Here, an intermolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been developed to build various benzofurans under undivided electrolytic conditions. Neither transition metals nor external chemical oxidants are required to facilitate the dehydrogenation and dehydration processes. The key factor in success was the use of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the electrolyte and hexafluoroisopropanol as the solvent, which play key roles in the cyclocondensation step. This electrolysis is scalable and can be used as a key step in drug synthesis. On the basis of several experimental results, the mechanism, particularly of the remarkable anodic oxidation and cyclization process, was illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amino&#8208;Induced 2D Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Aerobic Oxidation of Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure tuning: With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of an o&#8208;amino group, a coordination structure was tuned from a metal&#8211;organic pholyhedron to a 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA, AIA=2&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid) shows high catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of olefins under air atmosphere.







Abstract
With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of the o&#8208;amino group, we have successfully tuned a coordination structure from a metal&#8211;organic polyhedron (MOP) to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups, and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA) has been applied as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the aerobic epoxidation of olefins by using air as oxygen source. Without the aggregation problem of active sites in MOPs, Cu&#8208;AIA possesses much higher reactivity than MOP&#8208;1. Furthermore, the amino group of the framework has been used as a modifiable site through post&#8208;synthetic metalation (PSMet) to prepare a 2D MOF&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalyst, which shows excellent catalytic performance for the Suzuki reaction. It indicates that Cu&#8208;AIA can also work as a good 2D MOF carrier for the derivation of other heterogeneous catalysts.

      <title>Solvent Impact on the Properties of Benchmark Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Synthesis of CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks: CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 were synthesized by utilizing acetonitrile as the solvent. The typical breathing behavior of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 upon guest molecule adsorption was inhibited by a high concentration of defects. As shown by NMR spectroscopy these consist of noncoordinated &#8722;COOH groups. Breathing could be enforced by applying a pressure of about 60&#8197;MPa during mercury intrusion.







Abstract
Herein is reported the utilization of acetonitrile as a new solvent for the synthesis of the three significantly different benchmark metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 of idealized composition [Al(OH)(ISO)], [Ce6O4(OH)4(BDC)6], and [Al(OH)(BDC)], respectively (ISO2&#8722;: isophthalate, BDC2&#8722;: terephthalate). Its use allowed the synthesis of Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 on a gram scale. While CAU&#8208;10 and Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 exhibit properties similar to those reported elsewhere for these two materials, the obtained Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 shows no structural flexibility upon adsorption of hydrophilic or hydrophobic guest molecules such as water and xenon and is stabilized in its large&#8208;pore form over a broad temperature range (130&#8211;450&#8197;K). The stabilization of the large&#8208;pore form of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 was attributed to a high percentage of noncoordinating &#8722;COOH groups as determined by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The defective material shows an unusually high water uptake of 310&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the range of 0.45 to 0.65&#8197;p/p&#176;. In spite of showing no breathing effect upon water adsorption it exhibits distinct mechanical properties. Thus, mercury intrusion porosimetry studies revealed that the solid can be reversibly forced to breathe by applying moderate pressures (&#8776;60&#8197;MPa).

      <title>Structural Investigation of Hybrid Peptide Foldamers Composed of &#945;&#8208;Dipeptide Equivalent &#946;&#8208;Oxy&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
Peptide mimics: Conformational properties of peptides composed of new &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids are studied as dipeptide surrogates both in solution and as single crystals. Structural analysis suggests that the &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids can be accommodated into helices without significant deviation in the overall helical folding (see figure).







Abstract
Due to their equivalent lengths, &#948;&#8208;amino acids can serve as surrogates of &#945;&#8208;dipeptides. However, &#948;&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains have not been well studied because of synthetic difficulties and because of their insolubility in organic solvents. Recently we reported the spontaneous supramolecular gelation of &#948;&#8208;peptides composed of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. Here, we report the incorporation of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids as guests into the host &#945;&#8208;helix, &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide 12&#8208;helix and their single&#8208;crystal conformations. In addition, we studied the solution conformations of hybrid peptides composed of 1:1 alternating &#945; and &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. In contrast to the control &#945;&#8208;helix structures, the crystal structure of peptides with &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids exhibit &#945;&#8208;helical conformations consisting of both 13&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered H&#8208;bonds. The &#945;,&#948;&#8208;hybrid peptide adopted mixed 13/11&#8208;helix conformation in solution with alternating H&#8208;bond directionality. Crystal&#8208;structure analysis revealed that the &#945;,&#947;4&#8208;hybrid peptide accommodated the guest &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acid without significant deviation to the overall helix folding. The results reported here emphasize that &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains can be accommodated into regular &#945;&#8208;helix or 12&#8208;helix as guests without much deviation of the overall helix folding of the peptides.

      <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red Electrophosphorescent Iridium(III) Complexes Based on Optimizing Ancillary Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Mind the gap: A HOMO energy&#8208;level regulation strategy of modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligand is proposed with the aim of developing pure&#8208;red emission materials, with spectra mainly covering the region from &#955;=600 to 700&#8197;nm.

Abstract
Two new iridium(III) complexes were synthesized by introducing two trifluoromethyl groups into an ancillary ligand to develop pure&#8208;red emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligands is suppressed, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups, which can reduce the HOMO energy levels compared with those of compounds without trifluoromethyl groups. However, the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into the ancillary ligand has little impact on the LUMO energy levels. Therefore, a well&#8208;tuned, pure&#8208;red, excited&#8208;state energy was achieved by regulating the relative energy level between the HOMO and LUMO. OLEDs with these complexes as emitters showed high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26&#8201;% and realized high EQEs of about 25&#8201;% and fairly low driving voltages of 3.3&#8211;3.6&#8197;V for practical luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, as well as excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.66, 0.33) and (0.67, 0.33); thus, this demonstrates the successful molecular design strategy by modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of ancillary ligand.

&lt;p&gt;Two new iridium(III) complexes were synthesized by introducing two trifluoromethyl groups into an ancillary ligand to develop pure&#8208;red emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligands is suppressed, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups, which can reduce the HOMO energy levels compared with those of compounds without trifluoromethyl groups. However, the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into the ancillary ligand has little impact on the LUMO energy levels. Therefore, a well&#8208;tuned, pure&#8208;red, excited&#8208;state energy was achieved by regulating the relative energy level between the HOMO and LUMO. OLEDs with these complexes as emitters showed high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26&#8201;% and realized high EQEs of about 25&#8201;% and fairly low driving voltages of 3.3&#8211;3.6&#8197;V for practical luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.66, 0.33) and (0.67, 0.33); thus, this demonstrates the successful molecular design strategy by modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of ancillary ligand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) for Cancer Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic bullet: In this minireview, recent advances in the field of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for cancer therapeutic applications are highlighted, including those for drug delivery, phototherapy, and combined therapy.







Abstract
As newly emerged crystalline porous materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess fascinating structures and some specific features such as modularity, crystallinity, porosity, stability, versatility, and biocompatibility. Besides adsorption/separation, sensing, catalysis, and energy applications, COFs have recently shown a promise in biomedical applications. This contribution provides an overview of the recent developments of COF&#8208;based medicines in cancer therapeutics, including drug delivery, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and combined therapy. Furthermore, the major challenges and developing trends in this field are also discussed. These recent developments are summarized and discussed to help encourage further contributions in this emerging and promising field.

      <title>Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides</title>
      <dc:description>
Competition time: Anions, gases and solvents present in chemical reactions compete with ligands for metal coordination sites. Coordinating ability indices (CAI) rank such species according to their affinity to three families of metals: transition metals, lanthanides and s&#8208;block metals. After a brief review of recent applications to a variety of fields (synthesis, catalysis, nanochemistry, electrochemistry.), a new extended set of CAI is presented and discussed.







Abstract
After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s&#8208;block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)&#8197;the charge of an anion, (b)&#8197;the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)&#8197;the degree of protonation of oxo&#8208;anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)&#8197;the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes. Hit parades of solvents and anions most commonly used in the areas of transition metal, s&#8208;block and lanthanide chemistry are deduced from the statistics of their presence in crystal structures.

      <title>Is There a Single Ideal Parameter for Halogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Based Lewis Acidity?</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspecting halogen bonding: Is it possible to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strength accurately by a single DFT calculation and achieve better performance than that offered by the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth?







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bond donors (halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids) have now found various applications in diverse fields of chemistry. The goal of this study was to identify a parameter obtainable from a single DFT calculation that reliably describes halogen&#8208;bonding strength (Lewis acidity). First, several DFT methods were benchmarked against the CCSD(T) CBS binding data of complexes of 17 carbon&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donors with chloride and ammonia as representative Lewis bases, which revealed M05&#8208;2X with a partially augmented def2&#8208;TZVP(D) basis set as the best model chemistry. The best single parameter to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strengths was the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth, but it still provided inaccurate predictions for a series of compounds. Thus, a more reliable parameter, &#937;&#963;*, has been developed through the linear combination of the &#963;&#8208;hole depth and the &#963;*(C&#8722;I) energy, which was further validated against neutral, cationic, halogen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donors with very good performance.

      <dc:description>
Click! Postsynthetic functionalization of imine&#8208;based COFs is carried out at the solid&#8211;gas (COF&#8211;azide) interface, without solvent and catalyst, in high yield. This procedure is a green postsynthetic modification of COFs and allows for the preparation of 2D materials with high potential for the development of new applications.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reaction is among the most extensively used strategies for the post&#8208;polymerization modification of COFs. This work shows a new procedure for the postsynthetic functionalization of imine&#8208;based COFs by using a heterogeneous solid&#8211;gas reaction between alkyne&#8208;functionalized COFs and azides in the absence of a copper catalyst. This new alternative represents a step forward towards a greener postsynthetic modification of COFs opening a high potential for the development of new applications.

      <title>Cyclometalated Ruthenium Pincer Complexes as Catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones with Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkylation with ruthenium: Eight new Ru pincer complexes were prepared by introduction of C,N&#8208;bound phenyl heterocycle ligands. These complexes were applied as catalysts in the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols through hydrogen autotransfer. Here, superior yields in comparison to [RuHCl(CO)(HN(CH2CH2PPh2)2)] (Ru&#8208;MACHO) were achieved and 21 different alkylated ketones were synthesized in up to 97&#8201;% yield. Moreover, investigations regarding the catalyst species present during the reaction were conducted.







Abstract
Ruthenium PNP pincer complexes bearing supplementary cyclometalated C,N&#8208;bound ligands have been prepared and fully characterized for the first time. By replacing CO and H&#8722; as ancillary ligands in such complexes, additional electronic and steric modifications of this topical class of catalysts are possible. The advantages of the new catalysts are demonstrated in the general &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols following a hydrogen autotransfer protocol. Herein, various aliphatic and benzylic alcohols were applied as green alkylating agents for ketones bearing aromatic, heteroaromatic or aliphatic substituents as well as cyclic ones. Mechanistic investigations revealed that during catalysis, Ru carboxylate complexes are predominantly formed whereas neither the PNP nor the CN ligand are released from the catalyst in significant amounts.

      <title>Metallation&#8208;Induced Heterogeneous Dynamics of DNA Revealed by Single&#8208;Molecule FRET</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic complexity: The metallation of DNA by an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex is studied using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), revealing dynamic heterogeneity that is obscured at the ensemble level.







Abstract
The metallation of nucleic acids is key to wide&#8208;ranging applications, from anticancer medicine to nanomaterials, yet there is a lack of understanding of the molecular&#8208;level effects of metallation. Here, we apply single&#8208;molecule fluorescence methods to study the reaction of an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex and DNA. Individual metallated DNA hairpins are characterised using F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although ensemble measurements suggest a simple two&#8208;state system, single&#8208;molecule experiments reveal an underlying heterogeneity in the oligonucleotide dynamics, attributable to different degrees of metallation of the GC&#8208;rich hairpin stem. Metallated hairpins display fast two&#8208;state transitions with a two&#8208;fold increase in the opening rate to &#8776;2&#8197;s&#8722;1, relative to the unmodified hairpin, and relatively static conformations with long&#8208;lived open (and closed) states of 5 to &#8805;50&#8197;s. These studies show that a single&#8208;molecule approach can provide new insight into metallation&#8208;induced changes in DNA structure and dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic complexity&lt;/b&gt;: The metallation of DNA by an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex is studied using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), revealing dynamic heterogeneity that is obscured at the ensemble level.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metallation of nucleic acids is key to wide&#8208;ranging applications, from anticancer medicine to nanomaterials, yet there is a lack of understanding of the molecular&#8208;level effects of metallation. Here, we apply single&#8208;molecule fluorescence methods to study the reaction of an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex and DNA. Individual metallated DNA hairpins are characterised using F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although ensemble measurements suggest a simple two&#8208;state system, single&#8208;molecule experiments reveal an underlying heterogeneity in the oligonucleotide dynamics, attributable to different degrees of metallation of the GC&#8208;rich hairpin stem. Metallated hairpins display fast two&#8208;state transitions with a two&#8208;fold increase in the opening rate to &#8776;2&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, relative to the unmodified hairpin, and relatively static conformations with long&#8208;lived open (and closed) states of 5 to &#8805;50&#8197;s. These studies show that a single&#8208;molecule approach can provide new insight into metallation&#8208;induced changes in DNA structure and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis of the 8,19&#8208;Epoxysteroid Eurysterol&#8197;A</title>
      <dc:description>
From an animal sterol to a bioactive marine natural product: The first synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal sulfated sterol with a unique 8,19&#8208;epoxy bridge spanning ring&#8197;B, was elaborated exploiting an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report the first chemical synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal marine steroidal sulfate with a unique C8&#8722;C19 oxy&#8208;bridged cholestane skeleton. After C19 hydroxylation of cholesteryl acetate, used as an inexpensive commercial starting material, the challenging oxidative functionalization of ring&#8197;B was achieved by two different routes to set up a 5&#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one moiety. As a key step, an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was exploited to close the oxy&#8208;bridge (8&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy unit). DFT calculations show this reversible transformation being exergonic by about &#8722;30&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Along the optimized (scalable) synthetic sequence, the target natural product was obtained in only 11&#8197;steps in 5&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, an access to (isomeric) 7&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy steroids with a previously unknown pentacyclic ring system was discovered.

      <title>Tetraammineplatinum(II) and Tetraamminepalladium(II) Chromates as Precursors of Metal Oxide Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and the thermal decomposition mechanisms of precursors in different atmospheres were studied. The catalytic properties of bimetallic Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 were compared with those of monometallic Pt and Pd in CO total oxidation and preferential oxidation in excess hydrogen processes.







Abstract
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and characterized by a number of physicochemical methods of analysis (IR, single&#8208;crystal and powder XRD, and simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry with evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry). Thermolysis of the salts obtained in a hydrogen atmosphere proceeds with the partial reduction of chromium to a metallic state and the formation of MxCr1&#8722;x (M=Pt, Pd) metal solid solution with a chromium content of up to 22&#8197;at&#8201;% and chromium(III) oxide. The thermal decomposition of salts in an inert and oxidizing atmosphere passes through the formation stage of the MCrO2 phase with the delafossite structure followed by its subsequent decomposition into chromium(III) oxide and noble metal. Nanosized Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 composites obtained by the thermolysis of precursor salts in air at 500&#8201;&#176;C and being held at this temperature for 1&#8197;h showed a high catalytic activity in the CO total oxidation (TOX) and preferential oxidation in the excess of hydrogen (PROX) processes compared with that of monometallic Pt and Pd powders.

      <title>Increasing Complexity: A Practical Synthetic Approach to Three&#8208;Dimensional, Cyclic Sulfoximines and First Insights into Their in Vitro Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Practical and safe: An underrepresented structural motif in the life sciences is now accessible by a practical and safe synthetic approach. Five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in two to three steps in high yields and broad scope (17 examples). In vitro evaluation of properties relevant to medicinal chemistry of these three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for drug discovery.







Abstract
A short synthetic approach with broad scope to access five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines in only two to three steps from readily available thiophenols is reported. Thus, simple building blocks were converted to complex molecular structures by a sequence of S&#8208;alkylation and one&#8208;pot sulfoximine formation, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Seventeen structurally diverse cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in high overall yields. In vitro evaluation of these underrepresented, three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines with respect to properties relevant to medicinal chemistry did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for application in drug discovery.

In the present minireview, we summarize the recent advances in this exciting field and provide a critical discussion of the nature of their active sites and the structure&#8208;property correlation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Thermal decomposition of ternary sodium graphite intercalation compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalised graphene related materials (GRMs) in a specific solvent. This study explores the formation of the Na&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;GIC and a new ternary system based on dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Detailed comparisons of in situ temperature dependent XRD with TGA&#8208;MS and Raman measurements reveals a series of dynamic transformations during heating. Surprisingly, the bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene sheets. The heating process drives a reorganisation of the solvent and Na molecules, then an evaporation of the solvent; however, the solvent loss is arrested by restacking of the graphene layers, leading to trapped solvent bubbles. Eventually, the bubbles rupture, releasing the remaining solvent and creating expanded graphite. These trapped dopants may provide useful property enhancements, but also potentially confound measurements of grafting efficiency in liquid phase covalent functionalization experiments on &#8220;2D materials&#8221;.</dc:description>

      <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Carbon&#8208;Bound Boron Difluoride Hydrazone Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>The creation of dimeric boron difluoride complexes of chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is a proven strategy for the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of fluorescent dyes. We report dimers based on the boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) framework, which offer unique and sometimes unexpected substituent&#8208;dependent absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. BODIHY dimers have low&#8208;energy absorption bands (lmax = 421 to 479 nm, e = 17,200 to 39,900 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) that are red&#8208;shifted relative to monomeric analogues. THF solutions of these dimers exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon addition of water, with emission enhancement factors ranging from 5 to 18. Thin films of BODIHY dimers are weakly emissive as a result of the inner&#8208;filter effect, attributed to intermolecular p&#8208;type interactions. BODIHY dimers are redox&#8208;active and display two one&#8208;electron oxidation and two one&#8208;electron reduction waves that strongly depend on the N&#8208;aryl substituents. These properties are rationalized using density&#8208;functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments.</dc:description>

Abstract
The formation of semiconductor heterostructures is an effective approach to achieve high performance in electrical gas sensing. However, such heterostructures are usually prepared via multi&#8208;step procedures. In this contribution, by taking advantage of the crystal phase&#8208;dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, we report a one&#8208;step colloid method for the preparation of SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures, with x &#8776;30, 50, and 70. The obtained materials with solution processability were successfully fabricated into NO2 sensors. Among them, the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor with an active layer thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m exhibited the highest sensitivity to NO2 (30&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;ppm) with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 69&#8197;ppb at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). This was mainly attributed to the formation of p&#8211;n junctions that allowed for gas&#8208;induced modification of the junction barriers. Under 405&#8197;nm laser illumination, the sensor performance was further enhanced, exhibiting a 3.5&#8197;times increased response toward 0.1&#8197;ppm NO2, along with a recovery time of 4.6&#8197;min.

Among them, the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(50&#8201;%) based sensor with an active layer thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m exhibited the highest sensitivity to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (30&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;ppm) with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 69&#8197;ppb at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). This was mainly attributed to the formation of p&#8211;n junctions that allowed for gas&#8208;induced modification of the junction barriers. Under 405&#8197;nm laser illumination, the sensor performance was further enhanced, exhibiting a 3.5&#8197;times increased response toward 0.1&#8197;ppm NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, along with a recovery time of 4.6&#8197;min.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exciton Interactions, Excimer Formation, and [2&#960;+2&#960;] Photodimerization in Nonconjugated Curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Folding chromophores: A series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes has been synthesized. The compounds display solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission as a result of a folding process controlling intramolecular chromophore aggregation. An in&#8208;depth investigation of their photophysical properties allowed a complex kinetic scheme to be established and provided a rationale for the formation of the first example of photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of a series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes and the detailed investigation of their solvent&#8208;dependent spectroscopic and photophysical properties. In solvents of low polarity, intramolecular folding induces the formation of aggregated chromophores, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of which display the optical signature characteristic of weakly&#8208;coupled H&#8208;aggregates. The extent of folding and, in turn, of ground&#8208;state aggregation is strongly dependent on the nature of the flexible linker. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopies show that the Frenkel exciton relaxes into a fluorescent symmetrical excimer state with a long lifetime. Furthermore, our in&#8208;depth studies show that a weakly emitting excimer lies on the pathway toward a photocyclomer. Two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) allowed the structure of the photoproduct to be established. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a [2&#960;+2&#960;] photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.

      <title>Bimodal Heterogeneous Functionality in Redox&#8208;Active Conjugated Microporous Polymer toward Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional catalyst: Bimodal functionality toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photochemical H2 evolution of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) is explored. Tuning of the side&#8208;chain substitutions on oligo&#8208;(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene bola&#8208;amphiphilic struts shows distinct nanostructuring in CMPs, which has a high impact on catalytic performances.







Abstract
The designing and development of heterogeneous catalysts for conversion of renewable energy to chemical energies by electrochemical as well as photochemical processes is at the forefront of energy research. In this work, two new donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;mix and TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;gly) are synthesized through Schiff base condensation reaction using a microwave synthesizer. Notably, the asymmetric and symmetric bola&#8208;amphiphilic nature of the OPE struts results in distinct nanostructuring and morphologies in the CMPs. Interestingly, both CMPs show impressive heterogeneous catalytic activity toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions, and therefore, act as bimodal electro&#8208; and photocatalytic porous organic materials. Furthermore, the redox&#8208;active property of the CMPs is exploited for in&#8197;situ generation and stabilization of platinum nanoparticles (Pt), and these Pt@CMPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.

      <title>Defect Engineering of Two&#8208;dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS  2  ) holds great promise in electronic and optoelectronic applications owing to its unique structure and intriguing properties. The intrinsic defects such as sulfur vacancies (SVs) of MoS  2  nanosheets are found to be detrimental to the device efficiency. To mitigate this problem, functionalization of 2D MoS  2  using thiols has emerged as one of the key strategies for engineering defects. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to controllably engineer the SVs of chemically&#8208;exfoliated MoS  2  nanosheets using a series of substituted thiophenols in solution. The degree of functionalization can be tuned by varying the electron withdrawing strength of substituents in thiophenols. We find that the intensity of 2LA(M) peak normalized to A  1g  peak strongly correlates to the degree of functionalization. Our results provide a spectroscopic indicator to monitor and quantify the defect engineering process. This method of MoS  2  defect functionalization in solution also benefits the further exploration of defect&#8208;free MoS  2  for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Construction of a [16]&#8208;Imidazolium Cage via a Quadruple [2+2] Photocycloaddition and Its Selective Fluorescent Recognition of Pyranine (HPTS)</title>
      <dc:description>Polyimidazolium&#8208;based cages are considered promising materials based on their fascinating properties and potential applications. These three&#8208;dimensional functional structures are highly desirable for the recognition of particular guest molecules, however, their synthesis remains challenging. In this work, we have designed and synthesizes a pure [n]&#8208;imidazolium (n = 16) cage, the hexadecakisimidazolium salt H16&#8208;2(PF6)16, from tetragonal octakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;1(PF6)8. The synthetic method involves formation of metal&#8208;carbene templates, a quadruple photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition reaction and subsequent removal of metal ions. Specifically, the synthesized cage, featuring sixteen imidazolium moieties, demonstrated high efficiency for the selective fluorescent recognition of 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;pyrene trisulfonate (HPTS).&#160;The present work not only further develops the metal&#8208;carbene template strategy by exploiting a new type of polyimidazolium cage, but also provides encouraging prospects for the design of versatile imidazolium&#8208;based functional acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Emission from Precious Metal&#8208;Free Luminophores Consisting of C, H, O, Si, and S/P at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Ratiometric sensors: Dual emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence with comparable intensities is achieved with 1,4&#8208;disiloxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(acceptor)benzenes, in which arylsulfonyl and diarylphosphinyl groups are installed as acceptors. The dual&#8208;luminescent benzene derivatives allowed the performance of ratiometric luminescence sensing of temperature and molecular oxygen with high accuracy.







Abstract
Fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emissive compounds are valuable tools for ratiometric luminescence sensing. Herein, it is reported that 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;bis[bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphinyl]&#8208;1,4&#8208;disiloxybenzenes exhibit dual emission with emission peaks that were easily identified without performing time&#8208;gated measurement. The disiloxybenzenes in powder simultaneously fluoresced and phosphoresced at 358&#8211;374 and 457&#8211;470&#8197;nm, respectively, under vacuum. The intensity ratios of the phosphorescence/fluorescence maxima of the disiloxybenzenes in powder and in a thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate) were sensitive to temperature and molecular oxygen, respectively. The plots of the relative intensity versus temperature or partial pressure of molecular oxygen were well fitted with calibration curves defined by an exponential approximation with excellent correlation coefficients R2 (0.9708&#8211;0.9921), demonstrating the high potential of the disiloxybenzenes as precious metal&#8208;free probes applicable to ratiometric luminescence sensing.

      <title>Carbon&#8211;Phosphorus Coupling from C^N Cyclometalated AuIII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Go for P: C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes were discovered to readily react with phosphines under mild conditions to afford phosphoniums. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and DFT calculations provide insight into this rare AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
With the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report here on the AuIII&#8208;mediated Caryl&#8722;P bond formation occurring upon reaction of C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes with phosphines. The [Au(C^N)Cl2] complex&#8197;1 featuring the bidentate 2&#8208;benzoylpyridine (CCON) scaffold was found to react with PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) under mild conditions, including in water, to afford the corresponding phosphonium&#8197;5 through C&#8722;P reductive elimination. A mechanism is proposed for the title reaction based on in situ 31P{1H} NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS analyses combined with DFT calculations. The C&#8722;P coupling has been generalized to other C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes and other tertiary phosphines. Overall, this work provides new insights into the reactivity of cyclometalated AuIII compounds and establishes initial structure&#8211;activity relationships to develop AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

      <title>Imide&#8208;Fused Diazatetracenes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Add the imide: A series of imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes were synthesized by Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8722;N coupling. Their optical and electronic properties as well as solid&#8208;state structures were investigated. Further application in perovskite solar cells also illustrated the electron&#8208;transporting properties of our imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes (see figure).







Abstract
A series of imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#8722;N coupling with a highly active palladium source. The introduction of an imide segment effectively lowers the LUMO levels compared with that of unsubstituted diazatetracene. By adjusting the alkyl chains of the diazatetracenes, different solid&#8208;state packings were achieved, resulting in distinct photoluminescent behaviors. Their electron&#8208;transporting properties were demonstrated in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Perovskite solar cells as electron transporting layers.

      <dc:description>
Stable and separable atropisomers of meso tetra(N&#8208;mesyl pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin were synthesized. Other N&#8208;protection groups (tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), carboxybenzyl (Cbz), and Tosyl (Ts)) were explored in the &#8216;all&#8208;pyrrolic porphyrins&#8217; synthesis, but only a mixture of inseparable atropisomers were obtained.







Abstract
Atropisomerism has been observed in a variety of biaryl compounds and meso&#8208;aryl substituted porphyrins. However, in porphyrins, this phenomenon had been shown only with o&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;membered aromatic groups at the meso&#8208;position. We show herein that a 5&#8208;membered heteroaromatic (N&#8208;mesyl&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) group at the meso&#8208;position leads to atropisomerism. In addition, we report a &#8216;one&#8208;pot&#8217; synthetic route for the synthesis of &#8216;all&#8208;pyrrolic&#8217; porphyrin (APP) with several N&#8208;protection groups (Boc, Cbz, Ms and Ts). Among these groups, we found that only the Ms group gave four individually separable atropisomers of meso&#8208;tetra(N&#8208;Ms&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin. Furthermore, the reductive removal of Cbz&#8208; was achieved to obtain meso&#8208;tetra(pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin. Thus, our synthetic procedure provides an easy access to a group of APPs and stable atropisomers, which is expected to expand the application of novel APP&#8208;based materials.

      <title>Synthesis and Systematic Structural Analysis of Cationic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ruthenium Chalcogenocarbonyl Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium Half&#8208;Sandwiches: The synthesis and properties of a series of cationic chalcogenocarbonyl complexes of the type [CpRu(CE)(H2IMes)(CNCH2Ts)][BArF4] (H2IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; E=O, S, Se, Te) are reported herein. This series includes very rare examples of selenocarbonyl (CSe) and tellurocarbonyl (CTe) complexes of Ru&#8722;Cp fragments. The &#960;&#8208;acidic nature of the CE ligands increases upon descending the main group, and the stereochemical stability of the obtained chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal CE complexes is very high.







Abstract
Although the chemistry of transition&#8208;metal complexes with carbonyl (CO) and thiocarbonyl (CS) ligands has been well developed, their heavier analogues, namely selenocarbonyl (CSe) and tellurocarbonyl (CTe) complexes remain scarce.

      <title>Interception of Elusive Cationic Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn Heterobimetallic Adducts with Mixed Alkyl Bridges Featuring Multiple Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Weak but important: NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies reveal that weak agostic interactions play a central role in the stabilization of elusive Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn heterobimetallic complexes featuring inequivalent bridging alkyl groups, which are important species for several catalytic processes of industrial relevance.







Abstract
Heterobimetallic complexes with inequivalent bridging alkyl chains are very often invoked as key intermediates in many catalytic processes, yet their interception and structural characterization are lacking. Such complexes have been prepared from reactions of the cationic cyclometalated hafnocene [CpPrCp
Hf][B(C6F5)4] (1) with main group metal alkyls to afford the corresponding hetero&#8208;bridged cationic products, [CpPrCp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;R)E(R)n][B(C6F5)4] (E=Al or Zn; R=Me, Et, or iBu). NMR and DFT studies demonstrate that both bridging alkyls establish agostic interactions with Hf, which are appreciably stronger for ethyl rather than methyl groups. Hf&#8211;Al and Hf&#8211;Zn distances are surprisingly short and only slightly longer than computed Hf&#8211;Al or Hf&#8211;Zn single bond lengths (2.80&#8197;&#197;). Finally, a reaction of [CpPrCp
Hf(&#956;&#8208;Me)Zn(Me)][B(C6F5)4] with excess ZnMe2 yields an unprecedented heterotrimetallic species, [(CpPr)2Hf(&#956;&#8208;Me)(ZnMe)(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)ZnMe][B(C6F5)4], the detailed structure of which is elucidated by a combination of NMR spectroscopic methods and molecular calculations.

      <title>Azobenzene Isomerization&#8208;Induced Photomodulation of Electronic Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoswitches: The photoinduced trans&#8594;cis isomerization can alter the electron&#8208;donating abilities of azobenzene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Appropriate iridium&#8208;complex (see Figure) was synthesized and utilized to calculate Tolman Electronic Parameter (TEP) to provide the extent of alteration.







Abstract
Azobenzene&#8208;based protonated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(azobenzene)imidazolium chlorides (IAz&#8208;X&#8901;HCl; X=OMe, Br, H) were successfully synthesized and switching abilities of the attached azobenzene units along with the concomitant photoinduced generation of geometric isomers were studied. Upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV light, a p&#8208;methoxy&#8208;azobenzene derivative get transformed from all&#8208;trans isomer to nearly all&#8208;cis isomer at the photostationary state. The extent of photomodulation of electronic properties in the NHC ring of the p&#8208;methoxy&#8208;azobenzene derivative is determined through the Tolman Electronic Parameter (TEP). Iridium complex, [(IAz&#8208;OMe)IrCl(CO)2] was synthesized and infrared spectra were recorded in dichloromethane solution as film in NaCl crystals and by drop&#8208;casting in an ATR crystal. Comparison in averaged carbonyl stretching frequency between all&#8208;trans isomer (

) and all&#8208;cis isomer (

) indicates a significant decrement of &#916;tt&#8211;cc
av=2.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (film) and 3.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (ATR). Therefore, moderate to excellent enhancement of electron density (&#916;tt&#8211;cc TEP=2.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 [film] and 3.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 [ATR]) at the C&#8208;2 position of the NHC is achieved through trans&#8594;cis isomerization of the remotely placed azobenzene units. This fine phototuning of electron&#8208;donating ability at the catalytic center would pave the way to control NHC/NHC&#8208;metal catalyzed organic transformations through external stimuli.

      <title>Catechol Thioesters: Ligands for Hierarchically Formed Lithium&#8208;Bridged Titanium(IV) Helicates and Helicate&#8208;Based Switches</title>
      <dc:description>
Titanium springs: Titanium (IV) triscatechol thioester complexes form in the presence of lithium cations dinuclear helicates, showing a monomer&#8211;dimer equilibrium with dimerization tendencies lying between those of the corresponding ketones and oxoesters. Based on this principle, it is possible to obtain a switchable spring&#8208;type helicate which shows some spontaneous expansion in [D6]DMSO.







Abstract
The thioester moiety is introduced as a lithium binding unit for the hierarchical formation of titanium(IV) catecholate&#8208;based lithium&#8208;bridged helicates. In solution, the coordination compounds show a monomer&#8211;dimer equilibrium which &#8212;in comparison to the oxo esters&#8212; is significantly shifted towards the monomers. In addition, the influence of the thioester side chain on the dimerization behavior is investigated and an expansible/compressible molecular switch is synthesized. In the latter case expansion and compression are performed reversibly in methanol, whereas in DMSO spontaneous expansion occurs.

      <title>Late&#8208;Stage 18O Labeling of Primary Sulfonamides via a Degradation&#8211;Reconstruction Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>
A late&#8208;stage 18O labeling approach of sulfonamides that employs the corresponding unlabeled molecule as the starting material was developed. Upon deamination of the sulfonamide, a sulfinate intermediate was isotopically enriched using eco&#8208;friendly reagents H218O and 15NH3(aq) to afford a M+5 isotopologue of the parent compound.







Abstract
A late&#8208;stage 18O labeling approach of sulfonamides that employs the corresponding unlabeled molecule as the starting material was developed. Upon deamination of the sulfonamide, a sulfinate intermediate was isotopically enriched using eco&#8208;friendly reagents H218O and 15NH3(aq) to afford a M+5 isotopologue of the parent compound. This degradation&#8211;reconstruction approach afforded isolated yields of up to 96&#8201;% for the stable isotope labeled (SIL) sulfonamides, and was compatible with multiple marketed therapeutics, including celecoxib, on a gram scale. The SIL products also exhibited no 18O/16O back exchange under extreme conditions, further validating the utility of this green strategy for drug labeling for both in vitro and in vivo use. This procedure was also adapted to include pharmaceutically relevant methyl sulfones by using 13CH3, affording M+5 isotopic enrichment, thereby illustrating the broad utility of this methodology.

      <title>Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Dehydrogenation&#8208;Dehydrocoupling: An Atom Economical Access to Alkynylboranes</title>
      <dc:description>
A tandem made for two: An efficient synthesis of alkynylaminoborane was developed using a magnesium catalyst at room temperature. The reaction proceeds within few minutes in high yields releasing hydrogen through a tandem dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling original mechanism between terminal alkynes and boranes.







Abstract
Owing to the unusual reactivity of sterically hindered amine&#8211;borane complexes, a catalytic system based on magnesium salts was designed to perform a tandem dehydrogenation&#8211;dehydrocoupling between terminal alkynes and boranes. The reaction is providing pure alkynylboranes within few minutes at room temperature, with only two molecules of hydrogen as a byproduct.

      <title>Cp*RuCl&#8208;Vinyl Carbenes: Two Faces and the Bifunctional Role in Catalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>Ruthenium vinyl carbenes derived from Cp/Cp*RuCl&#8208;based complexes have been routinely invoked as key intermediates in tandem reactions involving a carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM). A priori, these intermediates resemble the Grubbs&#8208;type family of catalysts, but they exhibit a completely different reactivity pattern that few, if any, other catalytic system can reproduce so far. The reactivity of these species with &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;substituted alkynals showcases the peculiarities of these intermediates. While Z&#8208;vinyl dihydrooxazines are preferentially obtained with the former, Z&#8208;vinyl epoxypyrrolidines are obtained with the latter. A combination of spectroscopic and computational data now prove that a &#951;3&#8208;coordination mode of the ruthenium vinyl carbene and the presence of a Lewis basic chloride ligand give rise to two markedly different stereoelectronic faces that are responsible for the unconventional reactivity of these species.</dc:description>

Abstract
The synthesis of a new triaminoguanidinium&#8208;based ligand with three tris&#8208;chelating [NNO]&#8208;binding pockets and C3 symmetry is described. The reaction of tris&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylene&#8208;N&#8208;oxide)triaminoguanidinium salts with zinc(II) formate leads to the formation of cyclic supramolecular coordination compounds which in solution bind fullerenes in their spherical cavities. The rapid encapsulation of C60 can be observed by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is verified using computation.

      <title>Tandem Acid/Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Rearrangement of Glycol Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Easy to handle: Glycol derivatives are rearranged under the catalysis of sulfonic acids and subsequently reduced by a unique Pd/diphosphine (dtbpx=&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene) catalyst system with formic acid as transfer reductant. A [1,2] hydrogen shift leading to the subsequent formation of an aldehyde was identified as key step of the transformation, and a PdII&#8211;hydride complex is assumed as active hydrogenation catalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the acid/Pd&#8208;tandem&#8208;catalyzed transformation of glycol derivatives into terminal formic esters. Mechanistic investigations show that the substrate undergoes rearrangement to an aldehyde under [1,2] hydrogen migration and cleavage of an oxygen&#8208;based leaving group. The leaving group is trapped as its formic ester, and the aldehyde is reduced and subsequently esterified to a formate. Whereas the rearrangement to the aldehyde is catalyzed by sulfonic acids, the reduction step requires a unique catalyst system comprising a PdII or Pd0 precursor in loadings as low as 0.75&#8197;mol&#8201;% and &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene as ligand. The reduction step makes use of formic acid as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reductant. The substrate scope of the transformation encompasses both aromatic and aliphatic substrates and a variety of leaving groups.

      <title>Use of Dithiasuccinoyl&#8208;Caged Amines Enables COS/H2S Release Lacking Electrophilic Byproducts
</title>
      <dc:description>
No more electrophilic byproducts! The use of dithiasuccinoyl (DTS)&#8208;caged amines provides access to COS&#8208;based H2S donors that can be activated in the presence of biological thiols including cysteine and reduced glutathione to generate two equivalents of COS/H2S and release an amine&#8208;based payload. These donor compounds provide researchers with chemical tools to further probe the role of reactive sulfur species in biology.







Abstract
The enzymatic conversion of carbonyl sulfide (COS) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by carbonic anhydrase has been used to develop self&#8208;immolating thiocarbamates as COS&#8208;based H2S donors to further elucidate the impact of reactive sulfur species in biology. The high modularity of this approach has provided a library of COS&#8208;based H2S donors that can be activated by specific stimuli. A common limitation, however, is that many such donors result in the formation of an electrophilic quinone methide byproduct during donor activation. As a mild alternative, we demonstrate here that dithiasuccinoyl groups can function as COS/H2S donor motifs, and that these groups release two equivalents of COS/H2S and uncage an amine payload under physiologically relevant conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate that COS/H2S release from this donor motif can be altered by electronic modulation and alkyl substitution. These insights are further supported by DFT investigations, which reveal that aryl and alkyl thiocarbamates release COS with significantly different activation energies.

      <title>In a Quest for Selectivity Paired with Activity: A Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalyst Bearing an Unsymmetrical Phenanthrene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective, but still active! A ruthenium catalyst containing phenanthrene&#8208;based unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand has been synthesized. Its anomalous reactivity at 40&#8201;&#176;C contrasts known N&#8208;benzyl Hoveyda&#8208;type complexes that need high temperatures to operate. Simultaneously, it keeps high selectivity towards olefin metathesis products (see graphic).







Abstract
Robust, selective, and stable in the presence of ethylene, ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst, {[3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9&#8208;phenanthryl)]&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinylidene}dichloro(o&#8208;isopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium(II), Ru&#8208;3, bearing an unsymetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (uNHC) ligand, has been synthesized. The initiation rate of Ru&#8208;3 was examined by ring&#8208;closing metathesis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions with a broad spectrum of olefins, showing an unprecendented selectivity. It was also tested in industrially relevant ethenolysis reactions of olefinic substrates from renewable feedstock with very good yields and selectivities.

      <dc:description>A series of novel acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared via incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of platinum (II) and ruthenium (II).

      <title>Reversible M&#8208;M bonding by Alkaline Earth Metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) in Graphite Intercalation Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>The alkaline earth metals (M=Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) exhibit a +2 oxidation state in nearly all known stable compounds, but M(I) dimeric complexes with M&#8208;M bonding, [M 2 (en) 2 ] 2+ , (en = ethylenediamine) of all these metals can be stabilized within the galleries of donor&#8208;type graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). These metals can also form GICs with more conventional metal (II) ion complexes, [M(en) 2 ] 2+ . We report here facile interconversion be&#8208;tween dimeric&#8208;M(I) and monomeric&#8208;M(II) intercalates upon the addition/removal of en. Thermogravimetry, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and pair distribution function analysis of total scattering data support the presence of either [M 2 (en) 2 ] 2+ or [M(en) 2 ] 2+ guests. This phase conversion requires coupling graphene and metal redox centers, with associated reversible M&#8208;M bond formation within graphene galleries. This chemistry allows the facile isolation of unusual oxidation states, reveals M 0 &#8594;M 2+ reaction pathways, and present new opportunities in the design of hybrid conversion / intercalation materials for applications such as charge&#8208;storage.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Water Stability Limits and Degradation Pathways of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
      <dc:description>A comprehensive model to describe water stability of prototypal metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by combining different types of theoretical and experimental approaches is derived.

      <title>Giant Single&#8208;Crystal Shape Transformation with Wide Thermal Hysteresis Actuated by Synergistic Motions of Molecular Cations and Anions</title>
      <dc:description>Manipulating the collective molecular movements to implement macroscopic mechanical response of bulk material is attractive and challenging. Here, we synthesize an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid single crystal that exhibits a giant macroscopic shape transformation with a remarkable thermal hysteretic feature. The colossal anisotropic shape change, which manifests as an abrupt elongation of ca. 9% along crystallographic c&#8208;axis and a concomitant contraction of ca. 9% in a perpendicular direction, is induced by a significant reorientation of imidazoliums accompanied with a substantial configurational variation in CuBr  4  2&#8722;  complex anions. The synergistic motions of both the molecular cations and anions engender a remarkable large thermal hysteresis (&gt; 30 K) in the shape transformation of single crystal, implying this material may play a role in alternating memory media. Furthermore, due to the stable crystal lattice, a single crystal that demonstrates naked&#8208;eye detectable large shape transformation was used as a thermal actuator to spontaneously control an electric circuit by temperature variation.</dc:description>

The synthesized SiDBFCz clearly exhibits the bipolar characteristics especially with emitter molecules doped. An external quantum efficiency over 19% without any microcavity optimization is achieved thanks to the good charge balance in the SiDBFCz PHOLED. The device lifetime of the SiDBFCz PHOLED is improved more than 1000%, compared to the unipolar control devices at an initial luminance of 500 cd/m  2  . The dramatic enhancement of the operational stability of the deep blue PHOLED is also thoroughly investigated in terms of electrochemical stability of host molecules in charged or excited states.

      <title>A fast, low temperature synthesis method for hexagonal YMnO3: Kinetics, purity, size and shape as studied by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction mechanisms, phase development and kinetics of the hydrothermal synthesis of hexagonal&#8208;YMnO3 from Y2O3 and Mn2O3 using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction are reported under different reaction conditions with temperatures ranging from 300 to 350 &#176;C, and using 1, 5 and 10 M KOH, and 5 M NaOH mineraliser. Reactions initiated with Y2O3 hydrating to Y(OH)3, which then dehydrated to YO(OH). Higher temperature and KOH concentration led to faster, more complete dehydrations. However, 1 M KOH led to YO(OH) forming concurrently with Y(OH)3 before Y(OH)3 fully dehydrated, but yielded a very low phase purity of hexagonal&#8208;YMnO3. Using NaOH mineraliser, no YO(OH) was observed. Dehydration also initiated at a higher temperature in the absence of Mn2O3. The evolution of Rietveld refined scale factors was used to determine kinetic information and approximate activation energies for the reaction.

Characterization of the both the final products as well as the individual steps in the anion exchanged were performed via powder x&#8208;ray diffraction, fast neutron activation analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>TMDs beyond MoS2 for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Properties, morphologies, diversified chemistry, and fast ion diffusion with efficient intercalation of ions of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have spurred interest in them as active material electrodes for energy storage devices. These intriguing 2D materials share common properties, namely, large surface area, fast intercalation, and polymorphic structure. Nevertheless, their low electronic conductivity, cycling stability, and structural changes are challenges that require further research for TMDs to be attainable in applications such as batteries and supercapacitors. Herein we present a systematic review of cutting&#8208;edge research involving TMDs beyond MoS  2  as active materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors, currently absent in the literature. Accordingly, a critical overview of the recent progress concerning synthesis methods, physicochemical and electrochemical properties is reported. Similarly, trends and opportunities that may contribute to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Modular AND Gate Controlled Delivery Platform for Tumor Microenvironment Specific Activation of Protein Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Protein therapeutics has inspired intensive research interest in a variety of realms. It is still urgently required to avoid premature or unexpected activation of therapeutic proteins to achieve great specificity for therapy. Herein, we reported a modular AND gate controlled delivery platform for tumor microenvironment specific activation of therapeutic protein activity based on biomineralization of molecular glue adhered protein enzyme. The AND gate integrates the specific microenvironment of tumor tissues (acidic pH and a certain concentration of ATP) as inputs and activates the therapeutic activity of protein only when both inputs are active. More importantly, the activity of therapeutic protein would not be activated either at acidic pH or in the presence of ATP, which could greatly avoid the deleterious effect on normal tissues. Besides, this AND gate can be modular design and suitable for a variety of therapeutic proteins and nucleic acids.</dc:description>

Comprehensive factors, including ligand geometry, Zr6&#8208;cluster connectivity, acid modulator and reaction temperature/concentration, have been studied for controllable syntheses. The stability, hydrophobicity and gas adsorption/separation properties of obtained Zr&#8208;MOFs are explored.

      <dc:description>
A new strategy for activity&#8208;based probes is reported to address the members of the proteome that target &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine posttranslational modifications, which are highly prevalent and constitute a continuously expanding collection of chemical groups. In addition, this work provides the first investigation of the importance of peptide sequence on performance of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine&#8208;containing photo cross&#8208;linking probes, screening the efficiency of a combined series of 36 probe constructs against all 7 human sirtuins.







Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are important in the regulation of protein function, trafficking, localization, and marking for degradation. This work describes the development of peptide activity/affinity&#8208;based probes for the discovery of proteins that recognize novel acyl&#8208;based PTMs on lysine residues in the proteome. The probes contain surrogates of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine by introduction of either hydrazide or thioamide functionalities to circumvent hydrolysis of the modification during the experiments. In addition to the modified PTMs, the developed chemotypes were analyzed with respect to the effect of peptide sequence. The photo cross&#8208;linking conditions and subsequent functionalization of the covalent adducts were systematically optimized by applying fluorophore labeling and gel electrophoresis (in&#8208;gel fluorescence measurements). Finally, selected probes, containing the &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;glutaryllysine and &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;myristoyllysine analogues, were successfully applied for the enrichment of native, endogenous proteins from cell lysate, recapitulating the expected interactions of SIRT5 and SIRT2, respectively. Interestingly, the latter mentioned was able to pull down two different splice variants of SIRT2, which has not been achieved with a covalent probe before. Based on this elaborate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we expect that the technology will have broad future applications for pairing of novel PTMs with the proteins that target them in the cell.

Asymmetric annulation: With the development of a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+5] annulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with vinylethylene carbonates (VECs), an unprecedented tandem rearrangement reaction featuring a unique asymmetric aromatic Claisen rearrangement is described.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+5] annulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with substituted vinylethylene carbonates (VECs) is described for the first time, giving a novel enantioselective approach to chiral nine&#8208;membered benzoheterocycles. Based on this designed [4+5] annulation, an unprecedented silica gel&#8208;promoted tandem rearrangement reaction featuring a unique asymmetric aromatic Claisen rearrangement is explored at room temperature, offering a new method for asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters embedded in chiral functionalized homoallylic alcohols.

A modulated synthesis approach based on the chelating properties of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) is presented as a robust and versatile method to achieve highly crystalline Al&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. A comparative study on this method and the already established modulation by hydrofluoric acid was conducted using MIL&#8208;53 as test system. The superior performance of oxalic acid modulation in terms of crystallinity and absence of undesired impurities is explained by assessing the coordination modes of the two modulators and the structural features of the product. The validity of our approach was confirmed for a diverse set of Al&#8208;MOFs, namely X&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 (X=OH, CH3O, Br, NO2), CAU&#8208;10, MIL&#8208;69, and Al(OH)ndc (ndc=1,4&#8208;naphtalenedicarboxylate), highlighting the potential benefits of extending the use of this modulator to other coordination materials.

      <title>Asymmetric Construction of Alkaloids by Employing a Key &#969;&#8208;Transaminase Cascade</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic cascade has been developed for the synthesis of hexahydroquinoline and tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, relying on a key transaminase&#8208;mediated aza&#8208;Michael reaction followed by [3+3] annulation.







Abstract
An &#969;&#8208;transaminase&#8208;triggered intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction has been employed for the preparation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enaminones in good yield and excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, starting from easily accessible prochiral ketoynones and commercially available enzymes. The powerful thermodynamic driving force associated with the spontaneous aza&#8208;Michael reaction effectively displaces the transaminase reaction equilibrium towards product formation, using only two equivalents of isopropylamine. To demonstrate the potential of this methodology, this biocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael step was combined with annulation chemistry, affording unique stereo&#8208;defined fused alkaloid architectures.

      <title>Ambident Nucleophilic Substitution: Understanding Non&#8208;HSAB Behavior through Activation Strain and Conceptual DFT Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Faced Nucleophiles! We provide intuitive design rules to predict ambident reactivity for SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions, based on detailed quantum&#8208;chemical activation strain analyses. Our approach overcomes issues that arise from the use of the widely employed HSAB principle and constitutes a more comprehensive predictive model.







Abstract
The ability to understand and predict ambident reactivity is key to the rational design of organic syntheses. An approach to understand trends in ambident reactivity is the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. The recent controversy over the general validity of this principle prompted us to investigate the competing gas&#8208;phase SN2 reaction channels of archetypal ambident nucleophiles CN&#8722;, OCN&#8722;, and SCN&#8722; with CH3Cl (SN2@C) and SiH3Cl (SN2@Si), using DFT calculations. Our combined analyses highlight the inability of the HSAB principle to correctly predict the reactivity trends of these simple, model reactions. Instead, we have successfully traced reactivity trends to the canonical orbital&#8208;interaction mechanism and the resulting nucleophile&#8211;substrate interaction energy. The HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital interactions set the trend in both SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions. We provide simple rules for predicting the ambident reactivity of nucleophiles based on our Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analysis.

      <title>Electronic Structure Engineering of Carbon Nitride Materials by Using Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
      <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of carbon nitride (CN) polymers with predesigned charge&#8208;separation centres is reported, using supramolecular assemblies modified with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as reactants. The new CN materials exhibit excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting reaction.







Abstract
The design of charge separation sites under illumination in semiconductors is a standing challenge for their utilization as photo(electro)catalysts. Here, the synthesis of modified carbon nitride materials (CNs) with donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) domains, with altering electronic structure, is reported. To do so, new monomers based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazine were designed, which were then embedded within cyanuric acid&#8211;melamine supramolecular assemblies to form CN precursors. The conjugation degree of PAHs was systematically changed, from single benzene ring up to pyrene unit, elucidating the role of the conjugation degree on the morphology, structure and electronic properties as well as photo(electro)catalytic activity. The careful design of the D&#8211;A sites results in excellent photocatalytic activity as well as long&#8208;term stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, PAH&#8211;CNs films exhibit enhanced charge separation, optical absorption, electrochemical surface area and electronic conductivity, leading to an outstanding photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity compared to pristine CN.

Abstract
Herein, we present the synthesis of the bench&#8208;stable sodium bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfinate (BCP&#8208;SO2Na) and its application in the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) sulfones and sulfonamides. The salt can be obtained in a four&#8208;step procedure from commercially available precursors in multigram scale without the need for column chromatography or crystallization. Sulfinates are known to be useful precursors in radical and nucleophilic reactions and are widely used in medicinal chemistry. This building block enables access to BCP sulfones and sulfonamides avoiding the volatile [1.1.1]propellane which is favorable for the extension of SAR studies. Further, BCP&#8208;SO2Na enables the synthesis of products that were not available with previous methods. A chlorination of BCP&#8208;SO2Na and subsequent reaction with a Grignard reagent provides a new route to BCP sulfoxides. Several products were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Transformer&#8208;tive chemistry: High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) is changing the way we work in many fields of chemistry. A personal perspective, describing the distinctions between traditional synthetic organic chemistry and HTE from a careers and impact viewpoint.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) is a growing, enabling technology that allows the execution of large, parallel sets of experiments. Often, automation is required to dose compounds on milligram to sub&#8208;milligram scale, to run many parallel reactions, and to analyse large datasets. Unique approaches to screen design, implementation, and analysis are required, distinct from traditional synthetic organic chemistry. The discipline also presents a profitable opportunity for individual scientists to learn about and explore fields adjacent to chemistry, including data science, robotics and equipment engineering, and computer programming. This perspective presents the author's viewpoints on the field of HTE, its implementation within a chemistry career, and the automated future of organic chemistry technology.

      <dc:description>
Questioning the Suspects! Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy has revealed that defective 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC) linkers are located only in some crystals of [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] (BTC=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate) after co&#8208;crystallization into defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy in combination with other bulk techniques has shed light on the effects of this dispersion on the material (e.g., on metal oxidation state, the formation of mesopores or the crystal size).







Abstract
In the past few years, defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (DEMOFs) have been studied due to the plethora of textural, catalytic, or magnetic properties that can be enhanced by carefully introducing defect sites into the crystal lattices of MOFs. In this work, the spatial distribution of two different non&#8208;defective and defective linkers, namely 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) and 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC), respectively, has been studied in different DEMOF crystals of the HKUST&#8208;1 topology. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy revealed a nonhomogeneous distribution of defect sites within the [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] crystals, with the CYDC linker incorporated into defect&#8208;rich or defect&#8208;free areas of selected crystals. Additionally, advanced bulk techniques have shed light on the nature of the copper species, which is highly dynamic and directly affects the reactivity of the copper sites, as shown by probe molecule FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed the effect of co&#8208;crystallizing CYDC and BTC on the crystal size and the formation of mesopores, further corroborated by X&#8208;ray scattering analysis. In this way we have demonstrated the necessity of utilizing micro&#8208;spectroscopy along with a whole array of bulk spectroscopic techniques to fully describe multicomponent metal&#8211;organic frameworks.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cleavage Reaction of Keto Acids with Aliphatic Aldehydes for the Synthesis of Ketones and Ketone Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron power! Iron&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions were reported that are based on the decarboxylation/dehydrogenation of keto acids and decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes to obtain the valuable aryl ketones and ketone esters.







Abstract
The radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction is an important synthetic strategy. In this study, the iron&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction based on the decarboxylation of keto acids and decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes to obtain valuable aryl ketones is reported for the first time. Remarkably, when tertiary aldehydes were used as carbonyl sources, ketone esters were selectively obtained instead of ketones. The gram&#8208;scale preparation of aryl ketone through this strategy was easily achieved by using only 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the iron catalyst. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the bioactive molecule flurprimidol was synthesized in two steps by using this strategy.

      <title>Molecular Engineering Approaches Towards All&#8208;Organic White Light Emitting Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The great white hope: Molecular engineering approaches for the development of all&#8208;organic WLE materials are analyzed in view of different photophysical processes like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), charge transfer (CT), monomer&#8208;excimer emission, triplet&#8208;state harvesting, etc. The key aspect of tuning the molecular fluorescence under the influence of pH, heat, and host&#8211;guest interactions is also discussed (see graphic).







Abstract
White light emitting (WLE) materials are of increasing interest owing to their promising applications in artificial lighting, display devices, molecular sensors, and switches. In this context, organic WLE materials cater to the interest of the scientific community owing to their promising features like color purity, long&#8208;term stability, solution processability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and low toxicity. The typical method for the generation of white light is to combine three primary (red, green, and blue) or the two complementary (e.g., yellow and blue or red and cyan) emissive units covering the whole visible spectral window (400&#8211;800&#8197;nm). The judicious choice of molecular building blocks and connecting them through either strong covalent bonds or assembling through weak noncovalent interactions are the key to achieve enhanced emission spanning the entire visible region. In the present review article, molecular engineering approaches for the development of all&#8208;organic WLE materials are analyzed in view of different photophysical processes like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), charge transfer (CT), monomer&#8208;excimer emission, triplet&#8208;state harvesting, etc. The key aspect of tuning the molecular fluorescence under the influence of pH, heat, and host&#8211;guest interactions is also discussed. The white light emission obtained from small organic molecules to supramolecular assemblies is presented, including polymers, micelles, and also employing covalent organic frameworks. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge in the field of organic WLE materials, challenges, and future scope are delineated.

      <dc:description>
Thin films: For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level.







Abstract
Cubic silicon carbide (3C&#8208;SiC) material feature a suitable bandgap and high resistance to photocorrosion. Thus, it has been emerged as a promising semiconductor for hydrogen evolution. Here, the relationship between the photoelectrochemical properties and the microstructures of different SiC materials is demonstrated. For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as the photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level. This finding offers a strategy to design SiC&#8208;based photocathodes with superior photoelectrochemical performances.

      <title>Molecular Packing&#8208;Controlled Mechanical&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement of Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Functionalised Pyrazoline Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic writing: Four aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement were designed, synthesised and systematic studied. Their use as rewritable data storage materials was demonstrated.







Abstract
Organic mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement (MIEE) are scarce. Herein, Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with various non&#8208;conjugated substituent groups (Br, F, N,N&#8208;dimethylamino and cyano groups for TPEB, TPEF, TPEN and TPECN, respectively) were designed and synthesised. The fluorescence spectra of the compounds in the solid state were sensitive to mechanical stimuli and exhibited unique MFC properties. The solid fluorescence peaks of all compounds were red shifted, whereas the quantum yields of TPEB, TPEF and TPEN were increased and that of TPECN was slightly reduced after grinding. The MIEE mechanism was systematically investigated through structure&#8211;property relationship studies. The results showed that the pyrazoline ring of TPEB with MIEE property formed H&#8208;dimer aggregates with weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state. After grinding, the synergistic effects of conformational planarization and destructive &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induced the red shift of the fluorescence peak and the intensity enhanced. TPECN formed incompact J&#8208;aggregates with weak intermolecular interactions instead. The conformational planarization and increased intermolecular interactions induced by grinding led to the red&#8208;shifted peak and the slightly reduced intensity. These results clearly demonstrated that the translation of packing arrangements is an efficient method to design MIEE materials, which opens a new scope for designing unique MFC materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magic writing&lt;/b&gt;: Four aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement were designed, synthesised and systematic studied. Their use as rewritable data storage materials was demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials with mechanical&#8208;induced emission enhancement (MIEE) are scarce. Herein, Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalised pyrazoline derivatives with various non&#8208;conjugated substituent groups (Br, F, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dimethylamino and cyano groups for TPEB, TPEF, TPEN and TPECN, respectively) were designed and synthesised. The fluorescence spectra of the compounds in the solid state were sensitive to mechanical stimuli and exhibited unique MFC properties. The solid fluorescence peaks of all compounds were red shifted, whereas the quantum yields of TPEB, TPEF and TPEN were increased and that of TPECN was slightly reduced after grinding. The MIEE mechanism was systematically investigated through structure&#8211;property relationship studies. The results showed that the pyrazoline ring of TPEB with MIEE property formed H&#8208;dimer aggregates with weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state. After grinding, the synergistic effects of conformational planarization and destructive &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induced the red shift of the fluorescence peak and the intensity enhanced. TPECN formed incompact J&#8208;aggregates with weak intermolecular interactions instead. The conformational planarization and increased intermolecular interactions induced by grinding led to the red&#8208;shifted peak and the slightly reduced intensity. These results clearly demonstrated that the translation of packing arrangements is an efficient method to design MIEE materials, which opens a new scope for designing unique MFC materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Matrix Effects in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalyst Particle: Influence on Structure, Acidity, and Accessibility</title>
      <dc:description>Matrix effects in a Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst has been studied in terms of structure, accessibility, and acidity. An extensive characterization study into the structural and acidic properties of a FCC catalyst, its individual components (i.e., zeolite H&#8208;Y, binder (boehmite/silica) and kaolin clay), and two model FCC catalyst samples containing only two components (i.e., zeolite&#8208;binder and binder&#8208;clay) was performed at relevant conditions. This allowed drawing conclusions about the role of each individual component, describing their mutual physicochemical interactions, establishing structure&#8208;acidity relationships, and determining matrix effects in FCC catalyst materials. This has been made possible by using a wide variety of characterization techniques, including temperature programmed desorption of ammonia, infrared spectroscopy in combination with CO as probe molecule, transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Ar physisorption and advanced nuclear magnetic resonance. By doing so, it was for example revealed that a freshly prepared spray&#8208;dried FCC catalyst appears as a physical mixture of its individual components, but under typical riser reactor conditions, the interaction between zeolite H&#8208;Y and binder material is significant and mobile aluminum migrates and inserts from the binder into the defects of the zeolite framework, thereby creating additional Br&#248;nsted acid sites and restoring the framework structure.</dc:description>

Abstract
Facile redox&#8208;induced aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic interconversions were accomplished by using &#946;&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;21,23&#8208;dithiaporphyrin (CN4S2Por). Introduced cyano groups not only increased the reduction potential of the porphyrin core but also stabilized the antiaromatic isophlorin (CN4S2Iph) by &#960; conjugation. The reduction of CN4S2Por with hydrazine in polar solvents quantitatively affords CN4S2Iph, even under ambient conditions. CN4S2Iph retains a nearly planar conformation and exhibits considerable antiaromaticity. Aerobic oxidation of CN4S2Iph to CN4S2Por occurs in nonpolar solvents. This study was conducted to contribute to the understanding of the structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationship.

      <title>Organophotocatalytic N&#8208;Demethylation of Oxycodone Using Molecular Oxygen</title>
      <dc:description>
A green and scalable organophotocatalytic procedure that accomplishes the N&#8208;demethylation of oxycodone using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant and an organic dye (rose bengal) as an effective photocatalyst is presented. Optimization of the reaction conditions under continuous flow conditions using visible&#8208;light irradiation led to an efficient, reliable, and scalable process (see scheme).







Abstract
N&#8208;Demethylation of oxycodone is one of the key steps in the synthesis of important opioid antagonists like naloxone or analgesics like nalbuphine. The reaction is typically carried out using stoichiometric amounts of toxic and corrosive reagents. Herein, we present a green and scalable organophotocatalytic procedure that accomplishes the N&#8208;demethylation step using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant and an organic dye (rose bengal) as an effective photocatalyst. Optimization of the reaction conditions under continuous flow conditions using visible&#8208;light irradiation led to an efficient, reliable, and scalable process, producing noroxycodone hydrochloride in high isolated yield and purity after a simple workup.

Optimization of the reaction conditions under continuous flow conditions using visible&#8208;light irradiation led to an efficient, reliable, and scalable process (see scheme).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;Demethylation of oxycodone is one of the key steps in the synthesis of important opioid antagonists like naloxone or analgesics like nalbuphine. The reaction is typically carried out using stoichiometric amounts of toxic and corrosive reagents. Herein, we present a green and scalable organophotocatalytic procedure that accomplishes the N&#8208;demethylation step using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant and an organic dye (rose bengal) as an effective photocatalyst. Optimization of the reaction conditions under continuous flow conditions using visible&#8208;light irradiation led to an efficient, reliable, and scalable process, producing noroxycodone hydrochloride in high isolated yield and purity after a simple workup.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acid&#8208;Cleavable Poly(ethylene glycol) Hydrogels Displaying Protein Release at pH&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
Responsive gels: P(EG&#8208;co&#8208;isoEPB)MA, a PEG copolymer with acidic degradability under physiologically relevant pH is employed for hydrogels. The attached methacrylate units enable radical cross&#8208;linking to form protein&#8208;loaded hydrogels. Both the P(EG&#8208;co&#8208;isoEPB)MA copolymer as well as the respective hydrogels show rapid and tailorable hydrolysis at physiologically relevant pH (pH&#8197;5&#8211;6), despite excellent storage stability at neutral pH (pH&#8197;7.4).







Abstract
PEG is the gold standard polymer for pharmaceutical applications, however it lacks degradability. Degradation under physiologically relevant pH as present in endolysosomes, cancerous and inflammatory tissues is crucial for many areas. The authors present anionic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of ethylene oxide with 3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;butene (EPB) and subsequent modification to introduce acid&#8208;degradable vinyl ether groups as well as methacrylate (MA) units, enabling radical cross&#8208;linking. Copolymers with different molar ratios of EPB, molecular weights (Mn) up to 10&#8201;000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and narrow dispersities (&#272;&lt;1.05) were prepared. Both the P(EG&#8208;co&#8208;isoEPB)MA copolymer and the hydrogels showed pH&#8208;dependent, rapid hydrolysis at pH&#8197;5&#8211;6 and long&#8208;term storage stability at neutral pH (pH&#8197;7.4). By designing the degree of polymerization and content of degradable vinyl ether groups, the release time of an entrapped protein OVA&#8208;Alexa488 can be tailored from a few hours to several days (hydrolysis half&#8208;life time t1/2 at pH&#8197;5: 13&#8197;h to 51&#8197;h).

      <title>Heavier Alkaline&#8208;Earth Catalyzed Dehydrocoupling of Silanes and Alcohols for the Synthesis of Metallo&#8208;Polysilylethers</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkaline earths meet metallopolymers: The heavier alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) mediated catalytic dehydrocoupling of silanes and alcohols is reported. Mechanistic investigations are undertaken and a series of Ae&#8208;alkoxide complexes are isolated. By using ferrocenyl silane substrates, metallo&#8208;polysilylethers can be prepared using this catalysis.







Abstract
The dehydrocoupling of silanes and alcohols mediated by heavier alkaline&#8208;earth catalysts, [Ae{N(SiMe3)2}2&#8901;(THF)2] (I&#8211;III) and [Ae{CH(SiMe3)2}2&#8901;(THF)2], (IV&#8211;VI) (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) is described. Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols were coupled to phenylsilane or diphenylsilane, whereas tertiary silanes are less tolerant towards bulky substrates. Some control over reaction selectivity towards mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, or tri&#8208;substituted silylether products was achieved through alteration of reaction stoichiometry, conditions, and catalyst. The ferrocenyl silylether, FeCp(C5H4SiPh(OBn)2) (2), was prepared and fully characterized from the ferrocenylsilane, FeCp(C5H4SiPhH2) (1), and benzyl alcohol using barium catalysis. Stoichiometric experiments suggested a reaction manifold involving the formation of Ae&#8211;alkoxide and hydride species, and a series of dimeric Ae&#8211;alkoxides [(Ph3CO)Ae(&#956;2&#8208;OCPh3)Ae(THF)] (3&#8201;a&#8211;c, Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) were isolated and fully characterized. Mechanistic experiments suggested a complex reaction mechanism involving dimeric or polynuclear active species, whose kinetics are highly dependent on variables such as the identity and concentration of the precatalyst, silane, and alcohol. Turnover frequencies increase on descending Group&#8197;2 of the periodic table, with the barium precatalyst&#8197;III displaying an apparent first&#8208;order dependence in both silane and alcohol, and an optimum catalyst loading of 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ba, above which activity decreases. With precatalyst&#8197;III in THF, ferrocene&#8208;containing poly&#8208; and oligosilylethers with ferrocene pendent to&#8208; (P1&#8211;P4) or as a constituent (P5, P6) of the main polymer chain were prepared from 1 or Fe(C5H4SiPhH2)2 (4) with diols 1,4&#8208;(HOCH2)2&#8208;(C6H4) and 1,4&#8208;(CH(CH3)OH)2&#8208;(C6H4), respectively. The resultant materials were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and DOSY NMR spectroscopy, with estimated molecular weights in excess of 20,000&#8197;Da for P1 and P4. The iron centers display reversible redox behavior and thermal analysis showed P1 and P5 to be promising precursors to magnetic ceramic materials.

      <title>FeNi Alloy Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Carbon Shells Supported on N&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Like Carbon as Efficient and Stable Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly efficient FeNi alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon shells supported on N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;like carbon bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts were designed and constructed by a facile one&#8208;step pyrolysis method using elaborately screened small molecular precursors. The synergism of the carbon shell and FeNi alloy core together with the high&#8208;content doped N on the large specific surface area results in the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective and durable oxygen electrocatalysts remains highly critical but challenging for energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, a novel FeNi alloy nanoparticle core encapsulated in carbon shells supported on a N&#8208;enriched graphene&#8208;like carbon matrix (denoted as FeNi@C/NG) was constructed by facile pyrolyzing the mixture of metal salts, glucose, and dicyandiamide. The in situ pyrolysis of dicyandiamide in the presence of glucose plays a significant effect on the fabrication of the porous FeNi@C/NG with a high content of doped N and large specific surface area. The optimized FeNi@C/NG catalyst displays not only a superior catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, with an onset potential of 1.0&#8197;V and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84&#8197;V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, the potential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is 1.66&#8197;V) simultaneously in alkaline, but also outstanding long&#8208;term cycling durability. The excellent bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the synergism of the carbon shell and FeNi alloy core together with the high&#8208;content of nitrogen doped on the large specific surface area graphene&#8208;like carbon.

      <title>Light&#8208;Activated Rhenium Complexes with Dual Mode of Action against Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Shining a light on rhenium: A light&#8208;activated rhenium complex with activity against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has been developed. The activity profile against mutant strains combined with assessments of cellular uptake and synergy suggest two distinct modes of action.







Abstract

      <title>Symmetric Mixed Sulfur&#8211;Selenium Fused Ring Systems as Potential Materials for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
This study introduces a series of regioisomeric symmetric sulfur&#8211;selenium fused materials for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). These &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials show strong intermolecular interactions beneficial for charge carrier transport.







Abstract
A reliable synthetic protocol toward a series of fused chalcogenopheno[1]benzochalcogenophene (CBC) building blocks was developed based on a Fiesselmann reaction. The obtained CBC units were applied in McMurry and Stille coupling reactions toward symmetric regioisomeric ene&#8208;linked dimers. These &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds were characterized regarding their photophysical and electrochemical properties and proved to be materials with reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps compared to their sulfur&#8208;based analogues. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments revealed strong intermolecular selenium&#8211;selenium and selenium&#8211;carbon interactions depending on the position and number of incorporated selenium atoms. Good field&#8208;effect transistor performance with charge carrier mobilities up to 4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and high on/off ratios could be observed.

      <title>Facile Access to Substituted 1,4&#8208;Diaza&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diborinines</title>
      <dc:description>
Now established: Convenient access to 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;2,3&#8208;diborinines (DADBs) with variable steric demand of the backbone has been developed. Conversion of the initial bis(dimethylamino)&#8208;substituted DADBs into synthetically more useful halide derivatives offers almost indefinite possibilities for further functionalization of the boron centers aiming at the synthesis of cyclic bis(amino)diboranes(4) with specifically tuned properties.







Abstract
Several bis(dimethylamino)&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;2,3&#8208;diborinines (DADBs) were synthesized with variable substituents at the backbone nitrogen atoms. By reaction with HCl or BX3 (X=Br, I), these species were successfully converted into their synthetically more useful halide congeners. The high versatility of the generated B&#8722;X bonds in further functionalization reactions at the boron centers was demonstrated by means of salt elimination (MeLi) and commutation (NMe2 DADBs) reactions, thus making the DADB system a general structural motif in diborane(4) chemistry. A total of 18&#8197;DADB derivatives were characterized in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing a strong dependence of the heterocyclic bonding parameters from the exocyclic substitution pattern at boron. According to our experiments towards the realization of a Dipp&#8208;substituted, sterically encumbered DADB, the mechanism of DADB formation proceeds via a transient four&#8208;membered azadiboretidine intermediate that subsequently undergoes ring expansion to afford the six&#8208;membered DADB heterocycle.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Anionic Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Lithium Sulfonimidoyl Alkylidene Carbenoids With Organolithiums</title>
      <dc:description>
The nickel0&#8208;catalyzed anionic cross&#8208;coupling reaction (ACCR) of lithium sulfonimidoyl alkylidene carbenoids (metalloalkenyl sulfoximines) with organometallic reagents affords substituted alkenylmetals and lithium sulfinamides. The Ni0&#8208;catalyzed ACCR of three different types of metalloalkenyl sulfoximines, including acyclic, axially chiral, and exocyclic derivatives, with sp2 organolithiums and sp2 and sp3 Grignard reagents has been experimentally and theoretically studied.







Abstract
The mechanistic platform for a novel nickel0&#8208;catalyzed anionic cross&#8208;coupling reaction (ACCR) of lithium sulfonimidoyl alkylidene carbenoids (metalloalkenyl sulfoximines) with organometallic reagents is reported herein, affording substituted alkenylmetals and lithium sulfinamides. The Ni0&#8208;catalyzed ACCR of three different types of metalloalkenyl sulfoximines, including acyclic, axially chiral and exocyclic derivatives, with sp2 organolithiums and sp2 and sp3 Grignard reagents has been studied. The ACCR of metalloalkenyl sulfoximines with PhLi in the presence of the Ni0&#8208;catalyst and precatalyst Ni(PPh3)2Cl2 afforded alkenyllithiums, under inversion of configuration at the C atom and complete retention at the S atom. In a combination of experimental and DFT studies, we propose a catalytic cycle of the Ni0&#8208;catalyzed ACCR of lithioalkenyl sulfoximines. Computational studies reveal two distinctive pathways of the ACCR, depending on whether a phosphine or 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (COD) is the ligand of the Ni atom. They rectify the underlying importance of forming the key Ni0&#8208;vinylidene intermediate through an indispensable electron&#8208;rich Ni0&#8208;center coordinated by phosphine ligands. Fundamentally, we present a mechanistic study in controlling the diastereoselectivity of the alkenyllithium formation via the key lithium sulfinamide coordinated Ni0&#8208;vinylidene complex, which consequently avoids an unselective formation of an alkylidene carbene Ni&#8208;complex and ultimately racemic alkenyllithium.

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterisation of a Bio&#8208;Inspired Ni&#8208;Based Proton Reduction Catalyst Bearing a Pentadentate N2S3 Ligand with Improved Photocatalytic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
Copy that! Inspired by the sulfur&#8208;rich environment of [NiFe] hydrogenase, a Ni&#8208;based proton reduction catalyst bearing an acyclic pentadentate N2S3 ligand was shown to exhibit improved photocatalytic activity compared with a homologous counterpart with a tetradentate N2S2 ligand, which was mechanistically probed by time&#8208;resolved UV/Vis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by the sulfur&#8208;rich environment found in active hydrogenase enzymes, a Ni&#8208;based proton reduction catalyst with pentadentate N2S3 ligand was synthesised. When coupled with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) as photosensitiser and ascorbate as electron donor in a 1:1 mixture of dimethylacetamide and aqueous ascorbic acid/ascorbate buffer, the catalyst showed improved photocatalytic activity compared with a homologous counterpart bearing a tetradentate N2S2 ligand. The mechanistic pathway of photoinduced hydrogen evolution was comprehensively analysed through optical transient absorption and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, which revealed important electronic and structural changes in the catalytic system during photoirradiation. The NiII catalyst undergoes a photoinduced metal&#8208;centred reduction to form a NiI intermediate with distorted square&#8208;bipyramidal geometry. Further kinetic analyses revealed differences in charge&#8208;separation dynamics between the pentadentate and tetradentate forms.

      <title>Concurring Chalcogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions in Supramolecular Polymers for Crystal Engineering Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Rational design: The engineering of crystalline molecular solids through the simultaneous combination of distinctive non&#8208;covalent interactions is an important field of research. Through rational design, chalcogenazolo pyridine scaffold modules were prepared here that can interact with suitable complementary molecular modules, undergoing formation of supramolecular polymers in the solid state.







Abstract
The engineering of crystalline molecular solids through the simultaneous combination of distinctive non&#8208;covalent interactions is an important field of research, as it could allow chemist to prepare materials depicting multi&#8208;responsive properties. It is in this context that, pushed by a will to expand the chemical space of chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, a concept is put forward for which chalcogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonding interactions can be used simultaneously to engineer multicomponent co&#8208;crystals. Through the rational design of crystallizable molecules, chalcogenazolo pyridine scaffold (CGP) modules were prepared that, bearing either a halogen&#8208;bond acceptor or donor at the 2&#8208;position, can interact with suitable complementary molecular modules undergoing formation of supramolecular polymers at the solid state. The recognition reliability of the CGP moiety to form chalcogen&#8208;bonded dimers allows the formation of heteromolecular supramolecular polymers through halogen&#8208;bonding interactions, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

      <title>Luminescent Gold Nanorods To Enhance the Near&#8208;Infrared Emission of a Photosensitizer for Targeted Cancer Imaging and Dual Therapy: Experimental and Theoretical Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;point accuracy: Near&#8208;IR emission of protoporphyrin&#8197;IX is enriched by the weak emission of plasmonic gold nanoparticles through a competitive charge&#8208;transfer mechanism. The near&#8208;IR emitting multifunctional system also has cancer&#8208;targeting ability for imaging and multimodal therapy both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Strong plasmon absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region renders gold nanorods (GNRs) amenable for biomedical applications, particularly for photothermal therapy. However, these nanostructures have not been explored for their imaging potential because of their weak emission profile. In this study, the weak fluorescence emission of GNRs is tuned to match that of the absorption of a photosensitizer (PS) molecule, and energy transfer from the GNR to PS enhances the emission profile of the GNR&#8211;PS combination. GNR complexes generally quench the fluorescence emission of nearby chromophores. However, herein, the complex retains or rather enhances the fluorescence through competition in energy transfer. Excitation&#8208;dependent energy transfer has been explained experimentally and theoretically by using DFT calculations, the CIE chromaticity diagram, and power spectrum. The final GNR&#8211;PS complex modified for tumor specificity serves as an excellent organ&#8208;specific theranostic probe for bioimaging and dual therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Principal component analysis designates photodynamic therapy a better candidate than that of photothermal therapy for long&#8208;term efficacy in vivo.

      <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Glucosides with 3&#8208;O&#8208;Picoloyl&#8208;Protected Glycosyl Donors in the Presence of Excess Triflic Acid: Defining the Scope</title>
      <dc:description>
Among factors investigated, protonation of the picoloyl (Pico) group was determined to be crucial for achieving high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity in glycosidations of 3&#8208;Pico donors. A complete investigation of the scope of this reaction was performed, revealing all important attributes of successful glycosylation. While altering the halogen source was tolerated, substitution of the triflate anion resulted in complete loss of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Excellent &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity for the glycosylation with glucosyl donors equipped with the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl (Pico) group, without the use of participating group, was achieved in the presence of NIS/excess TfOH promoter system. A complete investigation of the scope of this reaction was performed, revealing all important attributes of successful glycosylation. While altering the halogen source was tolerated, substitution of the triflate anion resulted in complete loss of stereoselectivity. Protonation of the Pico group was determined to be crucial in this reaction. The stability or extent of the protonated pyridine ring was also found to be another important key factor in obtaining high stereoselectivity. The nucleophilicity of the acceptor was found to be proportional to the stereoselectivity obtained, suggesting an SN2&#8208;like mechanism.

Abstract
The synthesis of rhodium complexes with weakly binding highly fluorinated benzene ligands is described: 1,2,3&#8208;F3C6H3, 1,2,3,4&#8208;F4C6H2 and 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;F5C6H are shown to bind with cationic [Rh(Cy2P(CH2)xPCy2)]+ fragments (x=1, 2). Their structures and reactivity with alkenes, and use in catalysis for promoting the Tishchenko reaction of a simple aldehyde, are demonstrated. Key to the synthesis of these complexes is the highly concentrated reaction conditions and use of the [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722; anion.

      <title>Boosting Supercapacitor Performance of Graphene by Coupling with Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Clean sheet: Graphene nanosheets supported by hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks derived from ZIF&#8208;8 are fabricated through a simple PEI&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy, and exhibit a remarkably high capacitance and superior rate capability.







Abstract
Graphene as a suitable electrode has been extensively used for electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors based on its excellent properties, including high electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. However, one of the drawbacks is the unavoidable stacking tendency between the graphene nanosheets, resulting in limited electrochemically specific surface area. Herein, novel graphene nanosheets supported by hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks derived from ZIF&#8208;8 (GPNC) were fabricated through a simple polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy, to boost capacitance performance. Benefiting from the unique scaffold/support role of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks within the graphene interlayer, the GPNC with a large specific surface area, along with ample micropore/mesopore channels and high nitrogen content, is capable of facilitating electron and electrolyte ion migration kinetics and enhancing intrinsic electrochemical activity. Thus, the GPNC exhibits the highest charge storage of 218&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate capability of 74&#8201;% when the current density increased from 0.5 to 20&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 in comparison to pristine graphene and common ZIF&#8208;derived carbon/graphene electrodes. The assembled GPNC//GPNC two&#8208;electrode system further delivers a maximum power of 9080&#8197;Wkg&#8722;1 with outstanding electrochemical retention of 84&#8201;% over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.

However, one of the drawbacks is the unavoidable stacking tendency between the graphene nanosheets, resulting in limited electrochemically specific surface area. Herein, novel graphene nanosheets supported by hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks derived from ZIF&#8208;8 (GPNC) were fabricated through a simple polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy, to boost capacitance performance. Benefiting from the unique scaffold/support role of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks within the graphene interlayer, the GPNC with a large specific surface area, along with ample micropore/mesopore channels and high nitrogen content, is capable of facilitating electron and electrolyte ion migration kinetics and enhancing intrinsic electrochemical activity. Thus, the GPNC exhibits the highest charge storage of 218&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and superior rate capability of 74&#8201;% when the current density increased from 0.5 to 20&#8197;Ag&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in comparison to pristine graphene and common ZIF&#8208;derived carbon/graphene electrodes. The assembled GPNC//GPNC two&#8208;electrode system further delivers a maximum power of 9080&#8197;Wkg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with outstanding electrochemical retention of 84&#8201;% over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Based on Cobalt(II) Thiocyanate as XXZ Spin Chain</title>
      <dc:description>
Slowly relax&#8230; The magnetic properties of the linear chain compound [Co(NCS)2(4&#8208;methoxypyridine)2]n have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Slow relaxations of the ferromagnetic chains were observed in the antiferromagnetic state and the specific heat, susceptibility, and EPR data obtained have been reconciled by using the XXZ anisotropic Heisenberg model (see figure).







Abstract
The cobalt(II) in [Co(NCS)2(4&#8208;methoxypyridine)2]n are linked by pairs of thiocyanate anions into linear chains. In contrast to a previous structure determination, two crystallographically independent cobalt(II) centers have been found to be present. In the antiferromagnetic state, below the critical temperature (Tc=3.94&#8197;K) and critical field (Hc=290&#8197;Oe), slow relaxations of the ferromagnetic chains are observed. They originate mainly from defects in the magnetic structure, which has been elucidated by micromagnetic Monte Carlo simulations and ac measurements using pristine and defect samples. The energy barriers of the relaxations are &#916;&#964;1=44.9(5)&#8197;K and &#916;&#964;2=26.0(7)&#8197;K for long and short spin chains, respectively. The spin excitation energy, measured by using frequency&#8208;domain EPR spectroscopy, is 19.1&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and shifts 0.1&#8197;cm&#8722;1 due to the magnetic ordering. Ab initio calculations revealed easy&#8208;axis anisotropy for both CoII centers, and also an exchange anisotropy Jxx/Jzz of 0.21. The XXZ anisotropic Heisenberg model (solved by using the density renormalization matrix group technique) was used to reconcile the specific heat, susceptibility, and EPR data.

      <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Glucosides with 3&#8208;O&#8208;Picoloyl&#8208;Protected Glycosyl Donors in the Presence of Excess Triflic Acid: A Mechanistic Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthesis: Highly &#946;&#8208;stereoselective glycosidations of 3&#8208;Pico donors in the presence of excess TfOH were rationalized by the intermediacy of glycosyl triflates (see scheme).







Abstract
Our previous study showed that picoloylated donors are capable of providing excellent facial stereoselectivity through the H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) pathway. Presented herein is a detailed mechanistic study of stereoselective glycosylation with 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloylated glucosyl donors. While reactions of glycosyl donors equipped with the 3&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl group are typically non&#8208;stereoselective because these reactions proceed via the oxacarbenium intermediate, 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloylated donors are capable of providing enhanced, but somewhat relaxed, &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity by the HAD pathway. In an attempt to refine this reaction, we noticed that glycosylations are highly &#946;&#8208;stereoselective in the presence of NIS and stoichiometric TfOH. The HAD pathway is highly unlikely because the picoloyl nitrogen is protonated under these reaction conditions. The protonation and glycosylation were studied by low&#8208;temperature NMR, and the intermediacy of the glycosyl triflate has been observed. This article is dedicated to broadening the scope of this reaction in application to a variety of substrates and targets.

Charge carrier mobilities of &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds are essentially determined by electronic coupling between adjacent molecules. This study describes rational and reliable synthetic strategies towards mixed sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;based organic semiconductors allowing for a comparison of photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as for their crystallization behavior.

      <title>Reversible Phase Transition of Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Back and forth: In this Minireview, porous coordination polymers with reversible phase transition (RTP&#8208;PCPs) behavior have been summarized and classified based on different stimuli sources. Corresponding typical examples and applications of these RTP&#8208;PCPs are also introduced.







Abstract
Porous coordination polymers or metal&#8211;organic frameworks with reversible phase&#8208;transition behavior possess some attractive properties, and can respond to external stimuli, including physical and chemical stimuli, in a dynamic fashion. Their phase transitions can be triggered by adsorption/desorption of guest molecules, temperature changes, high pressure, light irradiation, and electric fields; these mainly include two types of transitions: crystal&#8211;amorphous and crystal&#8211;crystal transitions. These types of porous coordination polymers have received much attention because of their interesting properties and potential applications. Herein, reversible phase transition porous coordination polymers are summarized and classified based on different stimuli sources. Corresponding typical examples are then introduced. Finally, examples of their applications in gas separation, chemical sensors, guest molecule encapsulation, and energy storage are also presented.

      <title>The Nargenicin Family of Oxa&#8208;Bridged Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Narrow spectrum, broad possibilities: Over the past 40 years, several narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotics belonging to the nargenicin family have been identified and the biosynthetic pathway for the prototypical member of this family, nargenicin&#8197;A1, has been uncovered. Here, we review synthetic approaches to the nargenicins, in particular the unusual oxa&#8208;bridged decalin core, and investigate biosynthetic and structure&#8211;activity aspects of these rare antibiotics.







Abstract
The nargenicin family of antibiotic macrolides comprise a group of bacterial natural products with a rare ether bridged cis&#8208;decalin moiety and a narrow spectrum of activity. Most family members were identified almost four decades ago and were placed on the shelf due to the numbers of broad&#8208;spectrum compounds available at the time. However, in light of rising rates of antimicrobial resistance, there has been a renewed interest in the use of narrow&#8208;spectrum antimicrobials. Here, we review the history of this family of compounds, including synthetic approaches, and highlight the recently uncovered genetic basis for nargenicin production. Given the renewed pharmaceutical interest in these compounds, we also investigate structure&#8211;activity relationships among these molecules, with a view to the future development of members of this unusual antibiotic family.

Oxygen evolution: Cobalt nickel phosphate, oxidized from Co&#8208;doped Ni2P by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, contains high&#8208;valence cations and a large specific surface area. These superiorities, compared with phosphate obtained by electrochemical oxidation, lead to a catalyst with excellent performance in the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient and stable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are very crucial for energy storage and conversion. Here, an amorphous cobalt nickel phosphate (CoNiPO4), containing a considerable amount of high&#8208;valence Ni3+ species as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline solution, is reported. The catalyst was converted from Co&#8208;doped Ni2P through pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) and exhibits a large specific surface area of 162.5&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a low overpotential of 238&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 46&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, which is much lower than those of commercial RuO2 and IrO2. This work demonstrates that PLAL is a powerful technology for generating amorphous CoNiPO4 with high&#8208;valence Ni3+, thus paving a new way towards highly effective OER catalysts.

      <title>Alkali Metal Triphenyl&#8208; and Trihydridosilanides Stabilized by a Macrocyclic Polyamine Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
Silanides: The macrocyclic polyamine ligand Me4TACD (L) stabilizes the full range of alkali metal triphenylsilanides [(L)MSiPh3]n (M=Li&#8211;Cs) that have been studied in solution and in the solid state. They react with H2 or PhSiH3 to give molecular trihydridosilanides [(L)MSiH3] that are soluble in THF and can be regarded as model complexes for the hydrogen&#8208;storage material [MSiH3]&#8734;.







Abstract
Potassium silanide [KSiH3]&#8734; contains 4.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of hydrogen and has been intensely studied as hydrogen storage material. The macrocyclic ligand Me4TACD (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraaminocyclododecane, L) stabilizes the full range of triphenylsilyl complexes [(L)MSiPh3]n (M=Li&#8211;Cs), which react with H2 or PhSiH3 to form molecular [(L)MSiH3]n that can be isolated in soluble form and fully characterized.

      <title>Dihalogenated Methylperoxy Radicals: Spectroscopic Characterization and Photodecomposition by Release of HO.</title>
      <dc:description>
Dihalogenated methylperoxy radicals CHX2OO. (X=F, Cl) have been generated by reacting the hydrocarbon radicals CHX2. with O2 in the gas phase. Upon UV&#8208;light irradiation, both peroxy radicals decompose by release of the tropospheric oxidant HO. in solid Ar and N2&#8208;matrices.







Abstract
Two atmospherically relevant dihalogenated methylperoxy radicals CHX2OO. (X=F and Cl) have been generated through O2&#8208;oxidation of the corresponding alkyl radicals CHX2. in the gas phase. The IR spectroscopic characterization of both radicals in cryogenic Ar&#8208; and N2&#8208;matrices (15&#8197;K) is supported by 18O&#8208;labeling and ab initio calculations at the UCCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level. Upon 266&#8197;nm laser irradiation, both radicals decompose mainly by releasing hydroxyl radicals (&#8594;HO.+X2CO) via the intermediacy of intriguing &#945;&#8208;hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (.CX2OOH), implying that the photooxidation of dihalogenated hydrocarbons might serve as important sources of HO. radicals in the atmosphere.

      <title>Nanosensor for Sensitive Detection of the New Psychedelic Drug 25I&#8208;NBOMe</title>
      <dc:description>
Detection of 25I&#8208;NBOMe was achieved using mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with rhodamine&#8197;B, functionalized with a serotonin derivative and capped with the 5&#8208;HT2A receptor antibody. In the presence of the drug the 5&#8208;HT2A antibody was detached from the surface of the nanoparticles, leading to rhodamine&#8197;B release. The prepared solid allowed the sensitive and selective recognition of 25I&#8208;NBOMe in artificial saliva and in sweets.







Abstract
This work reports the synthesis, characterization, and sensing behavior of a hybrid nanodevice for the detection of the potent abuse drug 25I&#8208;NBOMe. The system is based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles, loaded with a fluorescent dye, functionalized with a serotonin derivative and capped with the 5&#8208;HT2A receptor antibody. In the presence of 25I&#8208;NBOMe the capping antibody is displaced, leading to pore opening and rhodamine&#8197;B release. This delivery was ascribed to 5&#8208;HT2A receptor antibody detachment from the surface due to its stronger coordination with 25I&#8208;NBOMe present in the solution. The prepared nanodevice allowed the sensitive (limit of detection of 0.6&#8197;&#956;m) and selective recognition of the 25I&#8208;NBOMe drug (cocaine, heroin, mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide, MDMA, and morphine were unable to induce pore opening and rhodamine&#8197;B release). This nanodevice acts as a highly sensitive and selective fluorometric probe for the 25I&#8208;NBOMe illicit drug in artificial saliva and in sweets.

      <title>Titanium&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Hydrogenation of Monocyclic and Polycyclic Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ti don't know but Ti been told, hydrogenation of arenes is pretty bold: The newly synthesized Ti&#8208;masked complex (&#951;6&#8208;ImDippN)(Xyketguan)Ti undergoes intermolecular conversion under photolysis to give the benzene&#8208;capped complex (ImDippN)(Xyketguan)Ti(&#951;6&#8208;C6H6). Both of these compounds are effective at the hydrogenation of monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: a first for Group&#8197;IV homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Two electron&#8208;reduction of the TiIV guanidinate complex (ImDippN)(Xyketguan)TiCl2 gives (&#951;6&#8208;ImDippN)(xyketguan)Ti (1intra) and (ImDippN)(Xyketguan)Ti(&#951;6&#8208;C6H6) (1inter) (Xyketguan=[(tBuC=N)C(NXylyl)2]&#8722;, Xylyl=2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl) in the absence or presence of benzene, respectively. These complexes have been found to hydrogenate monocyclic and polycyclic arenes under relatively mild conditions (150 psi, 80&#8201;&#176;C)&#8212;the first example of catalytic, homogeneous arene hydrogenation with TON &gt;1 by a Group&#8197;IV system.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ti don't know but Ti been told, hydrogenation of arenes is pretty bold&lt;/b&gt;: The newly synthesized Ti&#8208;masked complex (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;Im&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;N)(&lt;sup&gt;Xyket&lt;/sup&gt;guan)Ti undergoes intermolecular conversion under photolysis to give the benzene&#8208;capped complex (Im&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;N)(&lt;sup&gt;Xyket&lt;/sup&gt;guan)Ti(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Both of these compounds are effective at the hydrogenation of monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: a first for Group&#8197;IV homogeneous catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two electron&#8208;reduction of the Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; guanidinate complex (Im&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;N)(&lt;sup&gt;Xyket&lt;/sup&gt;guan)TiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;Im&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;N)(&lt;sup&gt;xyket&lt;/sup&gt;guan)Ti (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;intra&lt;/sup&gt;

These complexes have been found to hydrogenate monocyclic and polycyclic arenes under relatively mild conditions (150 psi, 80&#8201;&#176;C)&#8212;the first example of catalytic, homogeneous arene hydrogenation with TON &amp;gt;1 by a Group&#8197;IV system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structurally Diverse Acyl Bicyclobutanes: Valuable Strained Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
The preparation of an unprecedented toolbox of strained acyl bicyclobutane electrophiles&#8212;encompassing amino acids, dipeptides, bioisosteres, and bifunctional linchpin reagents&#8212;is reported from simple and readily available precursors.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) are highly strained carbocycles that have emerged as versatile synthetic tools, particularly for the construction of functionalized small molecules. This work reports two efficient pathways for the rapid preparation of over 20 structurally diverse BCB ketones, encompassing simple alkyl and aryl derivatives, as well as unprecedented amino acid, dipeptide, bioisostere, and bifunctional linchpin reagents currently inaccessible using literature methods. Analogues are readily forged in two steps and in high yields from simple carboxylic acids or through unsymmetrical ketone synthesis beginning with a convenient carbonyl dication equivalent. The utility of this novel toolbox of strained electrophiles for the selective modification of proteinogenic nucleophiles is highlighted.

      <title>Supramolecular Assemblies for Electronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
This work reveals a synergy between supramolecular chemistry and molecular electronics. A perylene diimide&#8208;bithiophene conjugated macrocycle is shown to act as a potent receptor for fullerenes, resulting in strong electronic communication between host and guest. When incorporated into the active layer of an organic field effect transistor (OFET) device, these supramolecular complexes enhance electron mobility relative to the empty macrocycle.







Abstract
This work presents a synergy between organic electronics and supramolecular chemistry, in which a host&#8211;guest complex is designed to function as an efficacious electronic material. Specifically, the noncovalent recognition of a fullerene, phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), by an alternating perylene diimide (P)&#8208;bithiophene (B) conjugated macrocycle (PBPB) results in a greater than five&#8208;fold enhancement in electron mobility, relative to the macrocycle alone. Characterization and quantification of the binding of fullerenes by host PBPB is provided alongside evidence for intermolecular electronic communication within the host&#8211;guest complexes.

Pd&#8208;mediated reactions have emerged as a powerful tool for the site&#8208;selective and bioorthogonal late&#8208;stage diversification of amino acids, peptides and related compounds. Indole moieties of tryptophan derivatives are susceptible to C2H&#8208;activation, whereas halogenated aromatic amino acids such as halophenylalanines or halotryptophans provide a broad spectrum of different functionalisations. The compatibility of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;couplings with functional groups in peptides, other biologically active compounds and even proteins has been demonstrated. This Review primarily compiles the application of different cross&#8208;coupling reactions to modify halotryptophans, halotryptophan containing peptides or halogenated, biologically active compounds derived from tryptophan. Modern approaches use regio&#8208; and stereoselective biocatalytic strategies to generate halotryptophans and derivatives on a preparative scale. The combination of bio&#8208; and chemocatalysis in cascade reactions is given by the biocompatibility and bioorthogonality of Pd&#8208;mediated reactions.

      <title>Amphiphilic Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Dyes: Synthesis, Fluorescence and Aggregation Behaviors in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Amphiphilic donor/acceptor dyes were synthesized from unsymmetrically substituted perylene bisimide dyes, which were obtained by three synthetic methods. The optical behaviors and aggregation behaviors of these functional dyes were studied by UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The donor/acceptor dye displays high efficient intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (96.4%) from pyrene to peylene bisimide chromophores, which leads to a high fluorescence color sensitivity to environment polarity. Under 365nm UV lamp, the light&#8208;emitting colors of donor/acceptor dye change from green to yellow with increasing solvent polarity, which demonstrates application potentials as a new class of fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes. The donor/acceptor dye in water was assembled into hollow vesicles with narrow size distribution as revealed by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements. The bilayer structure of vesicular wall was directly observed by transmission electron microscopy. These vesicular aggregates in water are fluorescent at 650&#8208;850 nm within near&#8208;infrared region.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Operando EPR, XANES/EXAFS, UV&#8208;vis and ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopic methods have been coupled for the first time in the same experimental setup for investigating unclear mechanistic aspects of selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by a Cu/TEMPO catalytic system.

The latter is cleaved in the further course of reaction into (bpy)(NMI)(HOO)Cu II &#8722;TEMPO monomers that are also EPR&#8208;silent due dipolar interaction with bound TEMPO. Both Cu monomers and the Cu dimer are catalytically active in the initial phase of the reaction, yet the dimer is definitely not a major active species nor a resting state since it is irreversibly cleaved in the course of the reaction while catalytic activity is maintained. Gradual formation of non&#8208;reducible Cu II leads to slight deactivation at extended reaction times.</dc:description>

      <title>Of Twists and Curves: Electronics, Photophysics and Upcoming Applications of Non&#8208;Planar Conjugated Organic Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;planar conjugated organic molecules (NPCOMs) contain pi &#8208;conjugation across their length and also exhibit asymmetry in their conformation. In other words, certain molecular fragments in NPCOMs are either twisted or curved out of planarity. This conformational asymmetry in NPCOMs leads to non&#8208;uniform charge&#8208;distribution across the molecule, with important photophysical and electronic consequences such as altered thermodynamic stability, chemical reactivity, as well as materials properties. Majorly, NPCOMs can be classified as having either fused or rotatable architectures. NPCOMs have been the focus of significant scientific attention in the recent past due to their exciting photophysical behavior that includes intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. In addition, they also have many useful materials characteristics such as biradical character, semi&#8208; conductivity, dynamic conformations, and mechanochromism. As a result, rational design of NPCOMs and mapping their structure&#8208;property correlations has become imperative. Researchers have executed conformational changes in NPCOMs through a variety of external stimuli such as pH, temperature, anions&#8208;cations, solvent, electric potential, and mechanical force in order to tailor their photophysical, optoelectronic and magnetic properties. Converging to these points, this review highlights the lucrative electronic features, photophysical traits and upcoming applications of NPCOMs by a selective survey of the recent scientific literature.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the Depolymerization of Paraformaldehyde with Pd&#8208;Phosphine Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Paraformaldehyde is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle chemical for the in&#8208;situ generation of formaldehyde and is therefore often used in chemistry, structural biology or medicine. We have investigated the depolymerization process of paraformaldehyde at different temperatures for the application as C1 surrogate in &#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions using in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Rather surprisingly, it was found that small amounts of commonly applied carbonylation catalysts slow down the depolymerization process significantly. By applying  1  H&#8208;,  17  O&#8208; and  31  P&#8208;NMR spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations the inhibition process could be assigned to an electron withdrawing coordination behavior of the Pd complex at the chain end of the paraformaldehyde chain.

      <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Cyclophanes as Crystalline Sponge and Their [2]Catenanes through SNAr Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
[2]Catenanes and porous cyclophane&#8208;based crystals: A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of adamantane&#8208;bearing cyclophanes and [2]catenanes has been achieved by SNAr reactions. The cyclophane&#8208;based organic crystals had permanent intrinsic porosity and were applied to the crystalline sponge method, by which the molecular structures of incorporated leaf alcohol and aldehyde were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
This work reports that cyclophanes and their [2]catenanes were synthesized by the SNAr reactions of disubstituted adamantanes bearing halophenol units and 3,6&#8208;dichlorotetrazine in moderate yields. In the crystalline state, the cyclophanes had hexagonal structures with a cavity. The [2]catenanes were composed of two macrocycles that were singly interlocked and orthogonally arranged, indicating the construction from eight component molecules through eight C&#8722;O bonds in a one&#8208;step reaction in up to 33&#8201;% yield. The cyclophanes were assembled to afford a supramolecular organic framework in the solid state, which exhibited permanent intrinsic porosity and adsorption of leaf alcohol or aldehyde in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal fashion. The molecular structures of the liquid guests were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The formation of catenanes and the use of cyclophane&#8208;based porous crystals in the crystalline sponge method may be largely ascribed to the solvophobic effects and the van der Waals interactions that originate in the aliphatic and bulky nature of the adamantane units.

In the crystalline state, the cyclophanes had hexagonal structures with a cavity. The [2]catenanes were composed of two macrocycles that were singly interlocked and orthogonally arranged, indicating the construction from eight component molecules through eight C&#8722;O bonds in a one&#8208;step reaction in up to 33&#8201;% yield. The cyclophanes were assembled to afford a supramolecular organic framework in the solid state, which exhibited permanent intrinsic porosity and adsorption of leaf alcohol or aldehyde in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal fashion. The molecular structures of the liquid guests were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The formation of catenanes and the use of cyclophane&#8208;based porous crystals in the crystalline sponge method may be largely ascribed to the solvophobic effects and the van der Waals interactions that originate in the aliphatic and bulky nature of the adamantane units.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, Solid State NMR Spectroscopy, and Electronic Structures of the Phosphidotrielates Li3AlP2 and Li3GaP2</title>
      <dc:description>The lithium phosphidoaluminate Li9AlP4 represents a new promising compound with a high lithium ion mobility. This triggered our search for new members in the family of lithium phosphidotrielates, and we report on the novel compounds Li3AlP2 and Li3GaP2, obtained directly from the elements via ball milling and subsequent annealing. Rietveld analyses reveal that both compounds crystallize isotypically in the orthorhombic space group Cmce (no. 64) with lattice parameters of a = 11.5138(2), b = 11.7634(2) and c = 5.8202(1) &#197; for Li3AlP2, and a = 11.5839(2), b = 11.7809(2) and c = 5.8129(2) &#197; for Li3GaP2. The crystal structures feature TrP4 (Tr = Al, Ga) corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;sharing tetrahedra, forming two&#8208;dimensional Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText  layers. The lithium atoms are located between and inside these layers. The crystal structures were confirmed by MAS&#8208;NMR spectroscopy.

      <title>Single Particle Essays to Determine Heterogeneities within Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is an important process in oil refinery industry to produce gasoline and propylene. Due to harsh reaction conditions, FCC catalysts are subject to deactivation through e.g. metal accumulation and zeolite framework collapse. Here, we perform a screening of the influence of metal poisons on the acidity and accessibility of an industrial FCC catalyst material using laboratory&#8208;based single particle characterization i.e., &#181;&#8208;XRF and fluorescence microscopy in combination with probe molecules. These methods have been performed on density&#8208;separated FCC catalyst fractions, allowing to determine interparticle heterogeneities in the catalyst under study. It was found that with increasing catalyst density and metal content, the acidity and accessibility of the catalyst particles decreased, while their distribution narrowed with catalyst age. For example, particles containing high Ni level possessed very low acidity and were hardly accessible by a Nile Blue dye. Single catalyst particle mapping identifies minority species like the presence of a phosphated zeolite ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;containing FCC additive for selective propylene formation, catalyst particles without any zeolite phase and catalyst particles, which act as a trap for SOx.</dc:description>

      <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Pyramidal Inversion Behavior of Phosphines Involved with the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is a considerably fascinating phenomenon because of application as a luminescent material in the aggregated state, which explores the large structural change of the molecules in the excited state. Recently it was reported that triphenylphosphine derivatives showed AIE behavior where phosphines undergo potentially large structural change in the excited state. Inspired by this report, we investigated photo&#8208;induced pyramidal inversion behavior of phosphines. In photochemical experiments, the prepared  P  &#8208;stereogenic phosphines exhibited photoracemization in the diluted solution, and a negative correlation was observed between the photoracemization and the AIE phenomenon. Theoretical computations revealed that the inversion barrier in the excited state was much smaller than that in the ground state. To the best of our knowledge, this is first report about the photo&#8208;induced pyramidal inversion behavior of phosphines, which will provide the new applications that have never been tried before.</dc:description>

Abstract
The thermodynamics of halogen bonding of a series of isostructural Group&#8197;10 metal pincer fluoride complexes of the type [(3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu)MF] (3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu=&#954;3&#8208;C6HR2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OPtBu2)2 with R=H, tBu, COOMe; M=Ni, Pd, Pt) and iodopentafluorobenzene was investigated. Based on NMR experiments at different temperatures, all complexes&#8197;1&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Ni), 2&#8208;H (R=H, M=Pd), 2&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pd), 2&#8208;COOMe (R=COOMe, M=Pd) and 3&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pt) form strong halogen bonds with Pd complexes showing significantly stronger binding to iodopentafluorobenzene. Structural and computational analysis of a model adduct of complex&#8197;2&#8208;tBu with 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene as well as of structures of iodopentafluorobenzene in toluene solution shows that formation of a type&#8197;I contact occurs.

      <title>Stereochemical Rules Govern the Soft Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Compounds: Understanding the Heliconical Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Phases of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Mirror symmetry breaking in fluids: Achiral bent&#8208;shaped molecules form a spontaneous or field induced short&#8208;pitch heliconical lamellar liquid&#8208;crystalline phase. The combination of the helix with the superstructural layer chirality leads to diastereomeric pairs and changes the switching mechanism from the naturally preferred rotation around the molecular long axis, inverting the layer chirality, to a precession on a cone, retaining the chirality.







Abstract
A series of bent&#8208;shaped 4&#8208;cyanoresorcinol bisterephthalates is reported. Some of these achiral compounds spontaneously form a short&#8208;pitch heliconical lamellar liquid&#8208;crystalline phase with incommensurate 3&#8208;layer pitch and the helix axis parallel to the layer normal. It is observed at the paraelectric&#8208;(anti)ferroelectric transition, if it coincides with the transition from random to uniform tilt and with the transition from anticlinic to synclinic tilt correlation of the molecules in the layers of the developing tilted smectic phase. For compounds with long chains the heliconical phase is only field&#8208;induced, but once formed it is stable in a distinct temperature range, even after switching off the field. The presence of the helix changes the phase properties and the switching mechanism from the naturally preferred rotation around the molecular long axis, which reverses the chirality, to a precession on a cone, which retains the chirality. These observations are explained by diastereomeric relations between two coexisting modes of superstructural chirality. One is the layer chirality, resulting from the combination of tilt and polar order, and the other one is the helical twist evolving between the layers. At lower temperature the helical structure is replaced by a non&#8208;tilted and ferreoelectric switching lamellar phase, providing an alternative non&#8208;chiral way for the transition from anticlinic to synclinic tilt.

      <title>Rational Design of a Cocktail of Inhibitors against A&#946; Aggregation</title>
      <dc:description>
A cocktail of several inhibitors which could bind with different species of A&#946; aggregates simultaneously and achieve co&#8208;inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, without any unwanted interference observed.







Abstract
It has been reported that many molecules could inhibit the aggregation of A&#946; (amyloid&#8208;&#946;) through suppressing either primary nucleation, secondary nucleation, or elongation processes. In order to suppress multiple pathways of A&#946; aggregation, we screened 23 small molecules and found two types of inhibitors with different inhibiting mechanisms based on chemical kinetics analysis. Trp&#8208;glucose conjugates (AS2) could bind with fibril ends while natural products (D3 and D4) could associate with monomers. A cocktail of these two kinds of molecules achieved co&#8208;inhibition of various fibrillar species and avoid unwanted interference.
