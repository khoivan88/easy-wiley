      <title>Yield &#8211; not only Lifetime &#8211; of the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Separated State in Iridium Complex&#8208;Polyoxometalate Dyads Impact Their Hydrogen Evolution Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Photosensitizer&#8208;polyoxometalate (PS&#8211;POM) dyads are promising systems for light&#8208;induced energy conversion, e.g. &#8220;solar&#8221; hydrogen generation. PS&#8211;POM dyads often feature short&#8208;lived photoinduced charge&#8208;separated states (CSS), the lifetime of which is considered crucial for their function in&#160; photocatalysis. Hence, strategies to extend the lifetimes of the photoinduced CSS target the PS photophysics or the POM redox properties. Recently, some of us reported PS&#8211;POM dyads based on cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes covalently linked to Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalate and observed distinct hydrogen evolution reactivity (HER), which was tuned by the central metal ion  M  of the POM  M  (  M  = Mn  3+  , Co  3+  , Fe  3+  ). Here, the photoinduced electron transfer processes in these Ir&#8211;POM  M  dyads is investigated to rationalize the differences in HER activity. Upon excitation of the Ir(III) complex, ultrafast (sub&#8208;ps) charge separation occurs, leading to different amounts of the charge&#8208;separated states (Ir  &#8226;+  &#8211;POM  M  &#8226;&#8208;  ) generated in different dyads. However, in all dyads the resulting Ir  &#8226;+  &#8211;POM  M  &#8226;&#8208;  CSS is short&#8208;lived (sub&#8208;ns). The reductive quenching of Ir  &#8226;+  &#8211;POM  M  &#8226;&#8208;  by triethyl amine is estimated to be very efficient for all dyads studied. We conclude that the yield instead of the lifetime of the Ir  &#8226;+  &#8211;POM  M  &#8226;&#8208;  CSS determines the catalytic capacity of the dyads investigated. This could lead to new design criteria for the development of novel PS&#8211;POM dyads.</dc:description>

      <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red Electrophosphorescent Iridium(III) Complexes Based on Optimizing Ancillary Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Mind the gap: A HOMO energy&#8208;level regulation strategy of modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligand is proposed with the aim of developing pure&#8208;red emission materials, with spectra mainly covering the region from &#955;=600 to 700&#8197;nm. High external quantum efficiencies are achieved with an exciplex cohost.







Abstract
Two new iridium(III) complexes were synthesized by introducing two trifluoromethyl groups into an ancillary ligand to develop pure&#8208;red emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligands is suppressed, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups, which can reduce the HOMO energy levels compared with those of compounds without trifluoromethyl groups. However, the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into the ancillary ligand has little impact on the LUMO energy levels. Therefore, a well&#8208;tuned, pure&#8208;red, excited&#8208;state energy was achieved by regulating the relative energy level between the HOMO and LUMO. OLEDs with these complexes as emitters showed high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26&#8201;% and realized high EQEs of about 25&#8201;% and fairly low driving voltages of 3.3&#8211;3.6&#8197;V for practical luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, as well as excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.66, 0.33) and (0.67, 0.33); thus, this demonstrates the successful molecular design strategy by modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of ancillary ligand.

      <title>Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides</title>
      <dc:description>
Competition time: Anions, gases and solvents present in chemical reactions compete with ligands for metal coordination sites. Coordinating ability indices (CAI) rank such species according to their affinity to three families of metals: transition metals, lanthanides and s&#8208;block metals. After a brief review of recent applications to a variety of fields (synthesis, catalysis, nanochemistry, electrochemistry.), a new extended set of CAI is presented and discussed.







Abstract
After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s&#8208;block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)&#8197;the charge of an anion, (b)&#8197;the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)&#8197;the degree of protonation of oxo&#8208;anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)&#8197;the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes. Hit parades of solvents and anions most commonly used in the areas of transition metal, s&#8208;block and lanthanide chemistry are deduced from the statistics of their presence in crystal structures.

     alt="Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition time&lt;/b&gt;: Anions, gases and solvents present in chemical reactions compete with ligands for metal coordination sites. Coordinating ability indices (CAI) rank such species according to their affinity to three families of metals: transition metals, lanthanides and &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;block metals. After a brief review of recent applications to a variety of fields (synthesis, catalysis, nanochemistry, electrochemistry.), a new extended set of CAI is presented and discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)&#8197;the charge of an anion, (b)&#8197;the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)&#8197;the degree of protonation of oxo&#8208;anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)&#8197;the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes. Hit parades of solvents and anions most commonly used in the areas of transition metal, &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;block and lanthanide chemistry are deduced from the statistics of their presence in crystal structures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zinc(II)&#8211;Organic Framework Films with Thermochromic and Solvatochromic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>

Abstract
Multiple&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photoluminescence films based on a ZnII&#8211;organic framework, {[Zn2(Htpim)(3,4&#8208;pydc)2]&#8901;4&#8201;DMF&#8901;4&#8201;H2O}n (1, Htpim=2,4,5&#8208;tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)imidazole, 3,4&#8208;H2pydc=3,4&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid), were fabricated. This compound consisted of a 2D corrugated layer, {Zn(3,4&#8208;pydc)}n, which was further pillared using a Y&#8208;shaped pillar N&#8208;donor ligand (Htpim) to form a 3D&#8208;pillared&#8208;layer framework with 1D open channels. The rectangular channels in the as&#8208;synthesized compound are fully occupied by guest DMF and H2O molecules. The framework exhibits instant and reversible thermochromic properties corresponding to the removal of different H2O and DMF guest molecules as temperature increases. The pale&#8208;yellow crystal undergoes significant redshifting to a greenish emission centered at 530&#8197;nm. Compound&#8197;1 also showed remarkable solvatochromic effects in the presence of various organic solvents without affecting its structural integrity. In addition, polycrystalline MOF films were grown on an &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 support for switchable and fast&#8208;response thermochromic and solvatochromic sensors.

      <title>Tandem Catalysis of Ammonia Borane Dehydrogenation and Phenylacetylene Hydrogenation Catalyzed by CeO2 Nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
      <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis. A CeO2 nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al) sandwich&#8208;structured catalyst has been used as a tandem catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (see figure). This work provides an alternative strategy for balancing the conversion and selectivity of liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed, selective hydrogenation in the liquid phase is widely used in industry for the synthesis of chemicals. However, it can be a challenge to prevent active nanoparticles (e.g., palladium) from aggregation/leaching and meanwhile achieve high conversion as well as selectivity, especially under mild conditions. To address these issues, a CeO2 nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al) sandwich&#8208;structured catalyst has been prepared in which the MIL&#8208;53(Al) porous shell can efficiently stabilize the palladium nanoparticles. When this catalyst was used in a tandem catalytic reaction involving the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, remarkably, the hydrogen released from the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane boosted the catalytic process, with 100&#8201;% conversion of phenylacetylene and a selectivity of 96.2&#8201;% for styrene, even at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, within 1&#8197;min. This work therefore provides an alternative strategy for balancing the conversion and selectivity of liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions.

      <title>Synthesis of the 8,19&#8208;Epoxysteroid Eurysterol&#8197;A</title>
      <dc:description>
From an animal sterol to a bioactive marine natural product: The first synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal sulfated sterol with a unique 8,19&#8208;epoxy bridge spanning ring&#8197;B, was elaborated exploiting an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report the first chemical synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal marine steroidal sulfate with a unique C8&#8722;C19 oxy&#8208;bridged cholestane skeleton. After C19 hydroxylation of cholesteryl acetate, used as an inexpensive commercial starting material, the challenging oxidative functionalization of ring&#8197;B was achieved by two different routes to set up a 5&#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one moiety. As a key step, an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was exploited to close the oxy&#8208;bridge (8&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy unit). DFT calculations show this reversible transformation being exergonic by about &#8722;30&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Along the optimized (scalable) synthetic sequence, the target natural product was obtained in only 11&#8197;steps in 5&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, an access to (isomeric) 7&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy steroids with a previously unknown pentacyclic ring system was discovered.

Abstract
Herein, the RhIII&#8208;catalyzed selective monoarylation and diarylation (symmetrical and unsymmetrical) of 8&#8208;methylquinolines with organoboron reagents are disclosed. The selective monoarylation of primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is achieved by using 7&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methylquinolines or by changing the quantity of the aryl boronic acids. The method is also applicable for the arylation of 2&#8208;ethylpyridines, and the heteroarylation with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acids. Symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylation of 8&#8208;methylquinolines have been carried out in one&#8208;pot and sequential manner, respectively. Late&#8208;stage monoarylation of oxime derivatives and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of monoarylated products has also been carried out. A mechanistic study revealed that the current reaction is first order with respect to both reactants and a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate may be involved in the catalytic cycle.

A mechanistic study revealed that the current reaction is first order with respect to both reactants and a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate may be involved in the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Azobenzene Isomerization&#8208;Induced Photomodulation of Electronic Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoswitches: The photoinduced trans&#8594;cis isomerization can alter the electron&#8208;donating abilities of azobenzene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Appropriate iridium&#8208;complex (see Figure) was synthesized and utilized to calculate Tolman Electronic Parameter (TEP) to provide the extent of alteration.







Abstract
Azobenzene&#8208;based protonated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(azobenzene)imidazolium chlorides (IAz&#8208;X&#8901;HCl; X=OMe, Br, H) were successfully synthesized and switching abilities of the attached azobenzene units along with the concomitant photoinduced generation of geometric isomers were studied. Upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV light, a p&#8208;methoxy&#8208;azobenzene derivative get transformed from all&#8208;trans isomer to nearly all&#8208;cis isomer at the photostationary state. The extent of photomodulation of electronic properties in the NHC ring of the p&#8208;methoxy&#8208;azobenzene derivative is determined through the Tolman Electronic Parameter (TEP). Iridium complex, [(IAz&#8208;OMe)IrCl(CO)2] was synthesized and infrared spectra were recorded in dichloromethane solution as film in NaCl crystals and by drop&#8208;casting in an ATR crystal. Comparison in averaged carbonyl stretching frequency between all&#8208;trans isomer (

) and all&#8208;cis isomer (

) indicates a significant decrement of &#916;tt&#8211;cc
av=2.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (film) and 3.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (ATR). Therefore, moderate to excellent enhancement of electron density (&#916;tt&#8211;cc TEP=2.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 [film] and 3.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 [ATR]) at the C&#8208;2 position of the NHC is achieved through trans&#8594;cis isomerization of the remotely placed azobenzene units. This fine phototuning of electron&#8208;donating ability at the catalytic center would pave the way to control NHC/NHC&#8208;metal catalyzed organic transformations through external stimuli.

      <title>Anilate Tethered Neutral Tetrahedral Pd(II) Cages Exhibiting Selective Encapsulation of Xylenes and Mesitylene</title>
      <dc:description>
Partner selective cages: A series of neutral tetrahedral Pd(II) cages were shown to exhibit selective encapsulation of xylene isomers and mesitylene. These selectivity values were achieved by the subtle variations in the portal diameters of the cages and the non&#8208;covalent interactions of these hydrocarbons with the anilate linkers (see figure).







Abstract
The design of porous materials for the recognition of multiple hydrocarbons is highly desirable for the energy&#8208;efficient separation and recognition of chemical feedstock. Herein, three new iso&#8208;structural porous discrete metal&#8211;organic cages of formula {[Pd3(NiPr)3PO]4(R&#8208;AN)6} (R&#8208;AN=anilate linkers) for the selective recognition of substituted aromatic hydrocarbons are reported. The tetrahedral cages&#8197;1, 2, and 3 containing anilate, chloranilate, and bromanilate linkers exhibited selective encapsulation of mesitylene, o&#8208;xylene, and p&#8208;xylene, respectively, over other analogous aromatic hydrocarbons. These selective encapsulations were driven by the variations in the portal diameters present at each of these cages and their interactions with the hydrocarbon guests. These observations are supported by mass spectrometry, NMR studies, and theoretical binding&#8208;energy calculations.

Abstract
A series of imide&#8208;fused diazatetracenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#8722;N coupling with a highly active palladium source. The introduction of an imide segment effectively lowers the LUMO levels compared with that of unsubstituted diazatetracene. By adjusting the alkyl chains of the diazatetracenes, different solid&#8208;state packings were achieved, resulting in distinct photoluminescent behaviors.

      <dc:description>
Aggregate and shine! New luminogens for aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) have been synthesized exploiting the one&#8208;pot Ti&#8208;mediated tetraarylation of 2,6&#8208;bis(arylethynyl)pyridines.

Abstract
New luminogens for aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which are characterized by a branched cross&#8208;conjugated 2,6&#8208;bis(1,2,2&#8208;triarylvinyl)pyridine motif, have been synthesized exploiting the one&#8208;pot Ti&#8208;mediated tetraarylation of 2,6&#8208;bis(arylethynyl)pyridines. Thin layer solid&#8208;state emitters were prepared by spin&#8208;coating of the luminogens, while AIE&#8208;colloidal dispersions were investigated in terms of optical density and scattering behaviour. This has given insight into particle size distributions, time evolution of the aggregation and the influence of different functionalization patterns on the luminescence of molecular aggregates. In particular, a combination of extinction spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering is being proposed as a powerful method for investigating the dynamic aggregation process in AIE&#8208;type colloids.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Generation of Benzynes from Phenols: Formation of Primary Anilines by the Deoxyamination of Phenols</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct and selective: Benzynes have been selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.







Abstract
Benzynes were selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. The direct conversion of a phenolic hydroxyl group into a free amino group is a useful method for the preparation of primary aryl amines that are hard to synthesize by using coupling reactions involving phenol derivatives with ammonia. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.

      <title>Late&#8208;Stage 18O Labeling of Primary Sulfonamides via a Degradation&#8211;Reconstruction Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>
A late&#8208;stage 18O labeling approach of sulfonamides that employs the corresponding unlabeled molecule as the starting material was developed. Upon deamination of the sulfonamide, a sulfinate intermediate was isotopically enriched using eco&#8208;friendly reagents H218O and 15NH3(aq) to afford a M+5 isotopologue of the parent compound.







Abstract
A late&#8208;stage 18O labeling approach of sulfonamides that employs the corresponding unlabeled molecule as the starting material was developed. Upon deamination of the sulfonamide, a sulfinate intermediate was isotopically enriched using eco&#8208;friendly reagents H218O and 15NH3(aq) to afford a M+5 isotopologue of the parent compound. This degradation&#8211;reconstruction approach afforded isolated yields of up to 96&#8201;% for the stable isotope labeled (SIL) sulfonamides, and was compatible with multiple marketed therapeutics, including celecoxib, on a gram scale. The SIL products also exhibited no 18O/16O back exchange under extreme conditions, further validating the utility of this green strategy for drug labeling for both in vitro and in vivo use. This procedure was also adapted to include pharmaceutically relevant methyl sulfones by using 13CH3, affording M+5 isotopic enrichment, thereby illustrating the broad utility of this methodology.

Multiple&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photoluminescence films based on a ZnII&#8211;organic framework were fabricated. This compound not only exhibited instant and reversible thermochromic properties corresponding to the removal of different H2O and DMF guest molecules as temperature increases but also showed remarkable solvatochromic effects in the presence of various organic solvents without affecting its structural integrity.

      <title>Luminescence&#8208;Driven Electronic Structure Determination in a Textbook Dimeric DyIII&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
      <dc:description>
Shine on: A dysprosium dinuclear complex textbook example is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of crystal field theory. This historical theory coupled with Boltzmann population allows the extraction of the energy spectrum of the ground state multiplet from luminescence that is used to model the magnetic properties.







Abstract
A textbook dysprosium dinuclear complex based on acetylacetone ligands, [Dy2(acac)4(&#956;2&#8208;acac)2(H2O)2], has been synthesized and fully characterized. This simple dimeric lanthanide complex shows well&#8208;resolved solid&#8208;state luminescence and behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet under zero DC field. A seminal crystal&#8208;field approach is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of an energetic picture.

      <dc:description>
Stable and separable atropisomers of meso tetra(N&#8208;mesyl pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin were synthesized. Other N&#8208;protection groups (tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), carboxybenzyl (Cbz), and Tosyl (Ts)) were explored in the &#8216;all&#8208;pyrrolic porphyrins&#8217; synthesis, but only a mixture of inseparable atropisomers were obtained.







Abstract
Atropisomerism has been observed in a variety of biaryl compounds and meso&#8208;aryl substituted porphyrins. However, in porphyrins, this phenomenon had been shown only with o&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;membered aromatic groups at the meso&#8208;position. We show herein that a 5&#8208;membered heteroaromatic (N&#8208;mesyl&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) group at the meso&#8208;position leads to atropisomerism. In addition, we report a &#8216;one&#8208;pot&#8217; synthetic route for the synthesis of &#8216;all&#8208;pyrrolic&#8217; porphyrin (APP) with several N&#8208;protection groups (Boc, Cbz, Ms and Ts). Among these groups, we found that only the Ms group gave four individually separable atropisomers of meso&#8208;tetra(N&#8208;Ms&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin. Furthermore, the reductive removal of Cbz&#8208; was achieved to obtain meso&#8208;tetra(pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) porphyrin. Thus, our synthetic procedure provides an easy access to a group of APPs and stable atropisomers, which is expected to expand the application of novel APP&#8208;based materials.

      <title>Synthetic and Biological Studies on New Urea and Triazole Containing Cystobactamid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Fighting Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria: Thirteen new cystobactamids, derived from cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 are prepared by chemical synthesis. Main modifications are exchange of the amide group by the chemically more stable urea group and the triazole ring as located in ring A. Antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive bacteria including a multidrug&#8208;resistant strain can be preserved, when the urea function is located between rings A and B and the triazole is positioned between rings C and D.







Abstract
Cystobactamids belong to the group of arene&#8208;based oligoamides that effectively inhibit bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. Cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 is the most active member of these antibiotics. Most amide bonds present in the cystobactamids link benzoic acids with anilines and it was found that some of these amide bonds undergo chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, especially the one linking ring C with ring D. This work reports on the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of thirteen new cystobactamids that still contain the methoxyaspartate hinge. However, we exchanged selected amide bonds either by the urea or the triazole groups and modified ring A in the latter case. While hydrolytic stability could be improved with these structural substitutes, the high antibacterial potency of cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 could only be preserved in selected cases. This includes derivatives, in which the urea group is positioned between rings A and B and where the triazole is found between rings C and D.

      <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral Carbazole&#8208;Based BODIPYs
</title>
      <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;tuned luminescence: A series of chiral carbazole&#8208;based boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) bearing binaphthyl units have been synthesized by the Et2AlCl&#8208;mediated reaction of the precursor BODIPY difluorides with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol. The chiroptical properties of the dyes were investigated, and they showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
A series of carbazole&#8208;based boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) 2&#8201;a&#8211;g bearing binaphthyl units have been synthesized by the Et2AlCl&#8208;mediated reaction of the corresponding BODIPY difluorides 1&#8201;a&#8211;g with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol. Substituents such as halogen, nitrile, and amino groups were tolerated under the reaction conditions, and the reaction of the phenylethynyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8201;h gave (R,R)&#8208;3&#8201;h bearing two binaphthyl units. The chiroptical properties of these dyes with different substituents were investigated by UV/Vis, CD, fluorescence, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The CD spectra showed Cotton effects in the absorption region of the BODIPY moieties. In addition, they showed CPL both in solution and in the solid state. Interestingly, several dyes recorded higher glum values in the solid state, probably due to intermolecular interactions. Because (R,R)&#8208;3&#8201;h recorded relatively low glum values, the diastereomer (R,S)&#8208;3&#8201;h was prepared. The (R,S) diastereomer showed intense CPL, which suggests a synergetic effect of the two binaphthyl groups. Finally, chiral carbazole&#8208;based BODIPY dimers have been synthesized for the first time and their chiroptical properties were investigated. They showed redshifted fluorescence and CPL, which reached the near&#8208;IR (NIR) region in the solid state.

      <title>Cover Feature: Palladium Complexes Based on Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (YPhos): Broadly Applicable High&#8208;Performance Precatalysts for the Amination of Aryl Halides at Room Temperature (Chem. Eur. J. 19/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines (YPhos) are excellent ligands for Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This work examines the impact of different ligand substituents and the use of defined precatalysts on the catalyst activity in room temperature C&#8722;N couplings. Increased selectivities and activities are obtained with the backbone&#8208;modified joYPhos ligand which exhibits extremely high activities (TOF&gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;h&#8722;1) and productivities for the coupling of a variety of amines and aryl halides.

      <dc:description>
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and the thermal decomposition mechanisms of precursors in different atmospheres were studied. The catalytic properties of bimetallic Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 were compared with those of monometallic Pt and Pd in CO total oxidation and preferential oxidation in excess hydrogen processes.







Abstract
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and characterized by a number of physicochemical methods of analysis (IR, single&#8208;crystal and powder XRD, and simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry with evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry). Thermolysis of the salts obtained in a hydrogen atmosphere proceeds with the partial reduction of chromium to a metallic state and the formation of MxCr1&#8722;x (M=Pt, Pd) metal solid solution with a chromium content of up to 22&#8197;at&#8201;% and chromium(III) oxide. The thermal decomposition of salts in an inert and oxidizing atmosphere passes through the formation stage of the MCrO2 phase with the delafossite structure followed by its subsequent decomposition into chromium(III) oxide and noble metal. Nanosized Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 composites obtained by the thermolysis of precursor salts in air at 500&#8201;&#176;C and being held at this temperature for 1&#8197;h showed a high catalytic activity in the CO total oxidation (TOX) and preferential oxidation in the excess of hydrogen (PROX) processes compared with that of monometallic Pt and Pd powders.

      <title>Carbon&#8211;Phosphorus Coupling from C^N Cyclometalated AuIII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Go for P: C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes were discovered to readily react with phosphines under mild conditions to afford phosphoniums. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and DFT calculations provide insight into this rare AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
With the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report here on the AuIII&#8208;mediated Caryl&#8722;P bond formation occurring upon reaction of C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes with phosphines. The [Au(C^N)Cl2] complex&#8197;1 featuring the bidentate 2&#8208;benzoylpyridine (CCON) scaffold was found to react with PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) under mild conditions, including in water, to afford the corresponding phosphonium&#8197;5 through C&#8722;P reductive elimination. A mechanism is proposed for the title reaction based on in situ 31P{1H} NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS analyses combined with DFT calculations. The C&#8722;P coupling has been generalized to other C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes and other tertiary phosphines. Overall, this work provides new insights into the reactivity of cyclometalated AuIII compounds and establishes initial structure&#8211;activity relationships to develop AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

      <title>Increasing Complexity: A Practical Synthetic Approach to Three&#8208;Dimensional, Cyclic Sulfoximines and First Insights into Their in Vitro Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Practical and safe: An underrepresented structural motif in the life sciences is now accessible by a practical and safe synthetic approach. Five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in two to three steps in high yields and broad scope (17 examples). In vitro evaluation of properties relevant to medicinal chemistry of these three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for drug discovery.







Abstract
A short synthetic approach with broad scope to access five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines in only two to three steps from readily available thiophenols is reported. Thus, simple building blocks were converted to complex molecular structures by a sequence of S&#8208;alkylation and one&#8208;pot sulfoximine formation, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Seventeen structurally diverse cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in high overall yields. In vitro evaluation of these underrepresented, three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines with respect to properties relevant to medicinal chemistry did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for application in drug discovery.

      <title>Functionalization of Piperidine Derivatives for the Site&#8208;Selective and Stereoselective Synthesis of Positional Analogues of Methylphenidate</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention, please: Regio, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 functionalization on piperidine ring controlled by catalysts and protecting groups has been employed for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate (Ritalin).







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertions and cyclopropanations of donor/acceptor carbenes have been used for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate. The site selectivity is controlled by the catalyst and the amine protecting group. C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TCPTAD)4, or N&#8208;brosyl&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TPPTTL)4 generated 2&#8208;substitited analogues. In contrast, when N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;oxoarylacetyl&#8208;piperidines were used in combination with Rh2(S&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;BrTPCP)4, the C&#8722;H functionalization produced 4&#8208;susbstiuted analogues. Finally, the 3&#8208;substituted analogues were prepared indirectly by cyclopropanation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;tetrahydropyridine followed by reductive regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanes.

      <title>Palladium Complexes Based on Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (YPhos): Broadly Applicable High&#8208;Performance Precatalysts for the Amination of Aryl Halides at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
User&#8208;friendly and easily accessible Pd complexes of three ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines (YPhos) were prepared and applied in C&#8722;N coupling reactions giving way to extremely active catalysts that allow for high yields and selectivities at room temperature for a wide variety of substrates. Aryl chlorides, bromides, and iodides were successfully coupled also in gram&#8208;scale and with low catalyst loadings including difficult substrates, such as alkyl amines.







Abstract
Palladium allyl, cinnamyl, and indenyl complexes with the ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines Cy3P+&#8722;C&#8722;(R)PCy2 (with R=Me (L1) or Ph (L2)) and Cy3P+&#8722;C&#8722;(Me)PtBu2 (L3) were prepared and applied as defined precatalysts in C&#8722;N coupling reactions. The complexes are highly active in the amination of 4&#8208;chlorotoluene with a series of different amines. Higher yields were observed with the precatalysts in comparison to the in situ generated catalysts. Changes in the ligand structures allowed for improved selectivities by shutting down &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination or diarylation reactions. Particularly, the complexes based on L2 (joYPhos) revealed to be universal precatalysts for various amines and aryl halides. Full conversions to the desired products are reached mostly within 1&#8197;h reaction time at room temperature, thus making L2 to one of the most efficient ligands in C&#8722;N coupling reactions. The applicability of the catalysts was demonstrated for aryl chlorides, bromides and iodides together with primary and secondary aryl and alkyl amines, including gram&#8208;scale applications also with low catalyst loadings of down to 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Kinetic studies further demonstrated the outstanding activity of the precatalysts with TOF over 10.000&#8197;h&#8722;1.

      <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Binder&#8208;Free Capacitive Deionization Electrode for Highly Efficient Sea Water Desalination</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;capacitive electrodes: Binder&#8208;free deionization electrodes fabricated by electrodeposition of SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier exhibiting a combination of pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance show excellent performance in water desalination due to the synergistic effect between the polyoxometalate and the polymer.







Abstract
Capacitive deionization is a promising technique in sea water desalination. Compared with common electrodes, mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes exhibit better performance in sea water desalination because they integrate pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance in one system. Herein, a 3D binder&#8208;free mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode was fabricated by direct electrodeposition of SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. In this electrode, SiW12O404&#8722;/polyaniline composite particles with a size of about 100&#8211;120&#8197;nm are dispersed homogenously on the 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. Its specific capacitance reaches 352&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. With increasing current from 1 to 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacitance only decays by 32&#8201;%. When employed in sea water desalination, the performance of this mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode is also excellent. At 1.2&#8197;V, the salt adsorption capacity of this mixed electrode reaches 23.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a salt adsorption rate of 1.38&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 in 500&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NaCl. The performance of this electrode is well retained after 30 cycles. The excellent sea water desalination performance originates from the synergistic effect between SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline. This work has developed polyoxometalate as a new material for capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mixed&#8208;capacitive electrodes&lt;/b&gt;: Binder&#8208;free deionization electrodes fabricated by electrodeposition of SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier exhibiting a combination of pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance show excellent performance in water desalination due to the synergistic effect between the polyoxometalate and the polymer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitive deionization is a promising technique in sea water desalination. Compared with common electrodes, mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes exhibit better performance in sea water desalination because they integrate pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance in one system. Herein, a 3D binder&#8208;free mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode was fabricated by direct electrodeposition of SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. In this electrode, SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/polyaniline composite particles with a size of about 100&#8211;120&#8197;nm are dispersed homogenously on the 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. Its specific capacitance reaches 352&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With increasing current from 1 to 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the specific capacitance only decays by 32&#8201;%. When employed in sea water desalination, the performance of this mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode is also excellent. At 1.2&#8197;V, the salt adsorption capacity of this mixed electrode reaches 23.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a salt adsorption rate of 1.38&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 500&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; NaCl. The performance of this electrode is well retained after 30 cycles. The excellent sea water desalination performance originates from the synergistic effect between SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline. This work has developed polyoxometalate as a new material for capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BODIPY&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Biothiols</title>
      <dc:description>
Biothiol probes: The development of BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes for the detection of biothiols, preferable detection of individual biothiols, as well as simultaneous discrimination among Cys, Hcy, and reduced glutathione (GSH) is systematically summarized.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes for biothiols have aroused increasing interest owing to their potential to enable better understanding of the diverse physiological and pathological processes related to the biothiol species. BODIPY fluorophores exhibit excellent optical properties, which can be readily tailored by introducing diverse functional units at various positions of the BODIPY core. In the present review, the development of fluorescent probes based on BODIPYs for the detection of biothiols are systematically summarized, with emphasis on the preferable detection of individual biothiols, as well as simultaneous discrimination among cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), reduced glutathione (GSH). In addition, organelle&#8208;targeting probes for biothiols are also highlighted. The general design principles, various recognition mechanisms, and biological applications are elaboratively discussed, which could provide a useful reference to researchers worldwide interested in this area.

      <title>Structural Investigation of Hybrid Peptide Foldamers Composed of &#945;&#8208;Dipeptide Equivalent &#946;&#8208;Oxy&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
Peptide mimics: Conformational properties of peptides composed of new &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids are studied as dipeptide surrogates both in solution and as single crystals. Structural analysis suggests that the &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids can be accommodated into helices without significant deviation in the overall helical folding (see figure).







Abstract
Due to their equivalent lengths, &#948;&#8208;amino acids can serve as surrogates of &#945;&#8208;dipeptides. However, &#948;&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains have not been well studied because of synthetic difficulties and because of their insolubility in organic solvents. Recently we reported the spontaneous supramolecular gelation of &#948;&#8208;peptides composed of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. Here, we report the incorporation of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids as guests into the host &#945;&#8208;helix, &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide 12&#8208;helix and their single&#8208;crystal conformations. In addition, we studied the solution conformations of hybrid peptides composed of 1:1 alternating &#945; and &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. In contrast to the control &#945;&#8208;helix structures, the crystal structure of peptides with &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids exhibit &#945;&#8208;helical conformations consisting of both 13&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered H&#8208;bonds. The &#945;,&#948;&#8208;hybrid peptide adopted mixed 13/11&#8208;helix conformation in solution with alternating H&#8208;bond directionality. Crystal&#8208;structure analysis revealed that the &#945;,&#947;4&#8208;hybrid peptide accommodated the guest &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acid without significant deviation to the overall helix folding. The results reported here emphasize that &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains can be accommodated into regular &#945;&#8208;helix or 12&#8208;helix as guests without much deviation of the overall helix folding of the peptides.

Abstract
Herein, we present the synthesis of the bench&#8208;stable sodium bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfinate (BCP&#8208;SO2Na) and its application in the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) sulfones and sulfonamides. The salt can be obtained in a four&#8208;step procedure from commercially available precursors in multigram scale without the need for column chromatography or crystallization. Sulfinates are known to be useful precursors in radical and nucleophilic reactions and are widely used in medicinal chemistry. This building block enables access to BCP sulfones and sulfonamides avoiding the volatile [1.1.1]propellane which is favorable for the extension of SAR studies. Further, BCP&#8208;SO2Na enables the synthesis of products that were not available with previous methods. A chlorination of BCP&#8208;SO2Na and subsequent reaction with a Grignard reagent provides a new route to BCP sulfoxides. Several products were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

      <title>Cover Feature: Anilate Tethered Neutral Tetrahedral Pd(II) Cages Exhibiting Selective Encapsulation of Xylenes and Mesitylene (Chem. Eur. J. 19/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Neutral molecular cages with definite intrinsic voids and adjustable portals are fascinating for the selective encapsulation and recognition of organic guest molecules. This work reports a family of iso&#8208;structural neutral tetrahedral Pd(II) derived cages built from three different anilate linkers that show the selective encapsulation of xylene isomers and mesitylene. The selective binding of these aromatic guests is driven by the variations in the portal diameters controlled by the substituents on the anilate backbone and their interactions with guest molecules.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cleavage Reaction of Keto Acids with Aliphatic Aldehydes for the Synthesis of Ketones and Ketone Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron power! Iron&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions were reported that are based on the decarboxylation/dehydrogenation of keto acids and decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes to obtain the valuable aryl ketones and ketone esters.







Abstract
The radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction is an important synthetic strategy. In this study, the iron&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction based on the decarboxylation of keto acids and decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes to obtain valuable aryl ketones is reported for the first time. Remarkably, when tertiary aldehydes were used as carbonyl sources, ketone esters were selectively obtained instead of ketones. The gram&#8208;scale preparation of aryl ketone through this strategy was easily achieved by using only 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the iron catalyst. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the bioactive molecule flurprimidol was synthesized in two steps by using this strategy.

      <title>Frontispiece: Advances in Artificial Layers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
The practical application of Li anodes is significantly hindered by the growth of Li dendrites that may cause severe safety issues. To inhibit the Li dendrites, coating an artificial layer on the Li metal anode has been proved as a facile and effective approach. In their review on page&#8197;4193&#8197;ff., Shijun Zhang, Zhengjin Yang, Liangliang Qu, Weixia Zhang and co&#8208;workers look at recent advances in artificial layers for stable Li metal anodes. Different types of artificial layers according to their mechanisms for Li dendrite inhibition, including regulation of uniform deposition of Li metal and suppression of Li dendrite growth, are discussed.

      <title>Amino&#8208;Induced 2D Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Aerobic Oxidation of Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure tuning: With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of an o&#8208;amino group, a coordination structure was tuned from a metal&#8211;organic pholyhedron to a 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA, AIA=2&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid) shows high catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of olefins under air atmosphere.







Abstract
With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of the o&#8208;amino group, we have successfully tuned a coordination structure from a metal&#8211;organic polyhedron (MOP) to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups, and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA) has been applied as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the aerobic epoxidation of olefins by using air as oxygen source. Without the aggregation problem of active sites in MOPs, Cu&#8208;AIA possesses much higher reactivity than MOP&#8208;1. Furthermore, the amino group of the framework has been used as a modifiable site through post&#8208;synthetic metalation (PSMet) to prepare a 2D MOF&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalyst, which shows excellent catalytic performance for the Suzuki reaction. It indicates that Cu&#8208;AIA can also work as a good 2D MOF carrier for the derivation of other heterogeneous catalysts.

This method has good functional&#8208;group compatibility and can serve as a powerful synthetic tool with high synthetic value.







Abstract
Preparative electrochemical synthesis is an ideal method for establishing green, sustainable processes. The major benefits of an electro&#8208;organic strategy over that of conventional chemical synthesis are the avoidance of reagent waste and mild reaction conditions. Here, an intermolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been developed to build various benzofurans under undivided electrolytic conditions. Neither transition metals nor external chemical oxidants are required to facilitate the dehydrogenation and dehydration processes. The key factor in success was the use of nBu4NBF4 as the electrolyte and hexafluoroisopropanol as the solvent, which play key roles in the cyclocondensation step. This electrolysis is scalable and can be used as a key step in drug synthesis. On the basis of several experimental results, the mechanism, particularly of the remarkable anodic oxidation and cyclization process, was illustrated.

      <title>Advances in Artificial Layers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Anode layering: An artificial layer coated on an anode can effectively inhibit Li dendrites by efficiently regulating the uniform deposition of Li and/or mechanically suppressing the growth of Li dendrites, which enables a stable Li metal anode for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is considered as the most promising anode material for rechargeable high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, the practical implement of Li anodes is significantly hindered by the growth of Li dendrites, which can cause severe safety issues. To inhibit the formation of Li dendrites, coating an artificial layer on the Li metal anode has been shown to be a facile and effective approach. This review mainly focuses on recent advances in artificial layers for stable Li metal anodes. It summarizes the progress in this area and discusses the different types of artificial layers according to their mechanisms for Li dendrite inhibition, including regulation of uniform deposition of Li metal and suppression of Li dendrite growth. By doing this, it is hoped that this contribution will provide instructional guidance for the future design of new artificial layers.

      <title>Scholl&#8208;Type Cycloheptatriene Ring Closure of 1,4,9,12&#8208;Tetraarylfenestrindanes: Reactivity and Selectivity in the Construction of Fenestrane&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Saddles</title>
      <dc:description>
Saddle up! The reactivity of thirteen symmetrical and two unsymmetrical tetraarylfenestrindanes towards fourfold Scholl&#8208;type heptagonal ring closure to generate the corresponding saddle&#8208;shaped derivatives was examined, with six new successful examples. The reaction mechanism and the observed selectivity of the twofold cyclization were also investigated by both experiments and DFT calculations (DDQ=dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone).







Abstract
The Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation, generating up to four cycloheptatriene rings around a fenestrindane core, leads to novel, saddle&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbon derivatives. In this article, we present the results of in&#8208;depth experimental and computational work on the oxidative cyclization of various 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes. In particular, the kinetic control of the four&#8208;step cyclization of the electronically activated tetrakis(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) derivative is elucidated. The reasons for the exclusive emergence of one single among the three possible doubly cyclized intermediates and for the nonappearance of the singly and triply cyclized intermediates are clarified. In addition, the origin of the concomitant bridgehead hydroxylation is studied. The reactivity of a set of fifteen symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes towards Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation is presented, pinpointing the structural factors that underlie this reaction and demonstrating the potential and limitations of this synthetic approach. A particularly surprising finding of this study is that the electronically nonactivated 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraphenylfenestrindane can also undergo the fourfold Scholl&#8208;type cyclization process and can be transformed into the parent saddle hydrocarbon.

      <dc:description>
New luminogens for aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and viscocromicity containing a branched cross&#8208;conjugated 2,6&#8208;bis(1,2,2&#8208;triarylvinyl)pyridine structural motif have been synthesized by one&#8208;pot Ti&#8208;mediated tetraarylation of 2,6&#8208;bis(arylethynyl)pyridines. A combination of extinction spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering has given insight into particle size distributions of the AIE&#8208;colloidal dispersions as well as the time evolution of the aggregation.

N,N&#8242;&#8208;Ethylene bridged bis&#8208;2&#8208;aryl pyrrolinium cations are reported in this work, which (a)&#8197;undergo stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron reduction coupled two hydrogen transfer to form E&#8208;diaminoalkenes; and (b)&#8197;have non identical pathways for reduction and oxidation.







Abstract
This work presents a stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron transfer induced hydrogen shift leading to the conversion of a bis&#8208;pyrrolinium cation to an E&#8208;diaminoalkene and vice versa. Remarkably, the forward and the reverse reaction, which are both reversible, follow two completely different reaction pathways. Establishing such unprecedented property in this type of processes was possible by developing a novel synthetic route towards the starting dication. All intermediates involved in both the forward and the backward reactions were comprehensively characterized by a combination of spectroscopic, crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and theoretical methods. The presented synthetic route opens up new possibilities for the generation of multi&#8208;pyrrolinium cation scaffold&#8208;based organic redox systems, which constitute decidedly sought&#8208;after molecules in contemporary chemistry.

      <title>Preparation, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation of an Azaborondipyrromethene/Zinc Porphyrin/Graphene Supramolecular Nanoensemble</title>
      <dc:description>
A supramolecular multichromophoric azaborondipyrromethene (ABDP)/ zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP)/exfoliated graphene (GR) nanoensemble was prepared and characterized. A pyridine&#8208;functionalized ABDP has been synthesized by complexation with ZnTPP. The nanoensemble photophysics have been evaluated and compared to those of the ABDP/ZnTPP complex, revealing that graphene alters the electronic interactions between the adsorbed chromophores.







Abstract
The preparation of an entirely supramolecular, multichromophoric azaborondipyrromethene (ABDP)/zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP)/exfoliated graphene (GR) nanoensemble was accomplished. The ABDP derivative bears glycol chains for enhancing solubility and a pyridine functionality for allowing coordination with ZnTPP. The ABDP/ZnTPP/GR nanoensemble was characterized in terms of morphology and composition by using complementary microscopy imaging, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The photophysical and electrochemical assessment of ABDP/ZnTPP/GR as well as the binding properties of the ABDP/ZnTPP complex, employed as a reference, are presented. Energy and electron transfer events were observed in ABDP/ZnTPP upon photoexcitation. However, in the case of ABDP/ZnTPP/GR, the graphene&#8208;induced aggregation of the chromophores alters their electronic interactions, enhancing the energy/electron transfer process between them.

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Carbon Framework Anchored Polyoxometalate as a High&#8208;Performance Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate anode: A novel 3D Carbon&#8208;PMo12 composite is fabricated, which displays a significantly improved Li&#8208;ion storage performance as an anode for Li&#8208;ion batteries, with excellent reversible specific capacity and rate capacity.







Abstract
Recently, it has become very important to develop cost&#8208;effective anode materials for the large&#8208;scale use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives for LIB electrodes owing to their reversible multi&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer capacity. Herein, Keggin&#8208;type [PMo12O40]3&#8722; (donated as PMo12) clusters are anchored onto a 3D microporous carbon framework derived from ZIF&#8208;8 through electrostatic interactions. The PMo12 clusters can be immobilized steadily and uniformly on the carbon framework, which provides enhanced electrical conductivity and high stability. Compared with PMo12 itself, the as&#8208;prepared novel 3D Carbon&#8208;PMo12 composite displays a significantly improved Li&#8208;ion storage performance as an LIB anode, with excellent reversible specific capacity and rate capacity, as well as high cycling performance (discharge capacity of 985&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles), which are superior to other POM&#8208;based anode materials reported so far. The high performance of the Carbon&#8208;PMo12 composite can be attributed to the 3D conductive network with fast electron transport, high ratio of pseudocapacitive contribution, and evenly distributed PMo12 clusters with reversible 24&#8208;electron transfer capacity. This work offers a facile way to explore novel LIB anodes consisting of electroactive molecule clusters.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of a Group&#8197;B Streptococcus Type&#8197;III Synthetic Glycan&#8211;Conjugate Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Deciphering the sugar glycocode: Starting from the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of a fragment from Group&#8197;B Streptococcus type&#8197;III capsular polysaccharide in complex with a protective mAb complex, a hexasaccharide comprising exclusively the relevant positions involved in interactions was obtained. By structural and immunogenicity studies it was shown that the synthetic hexasaccharide recognized the mAb similarly to the polysaccharide fragment and, conjugated to a carrier protein, suffices as vaccine antigen.







Abstract
Identification of glycan functional epitopes is of paramount importance for rational design of glycoconjugate vaccines. We recently mapped the structural epitope of the capsular polysaccharide from type&#8197;III Group&#8197;B Streptococcus (GBSIII), a major cause of invasive disease in newborns, by using a dimer fragment (composed of two pentasaccharide repeating units) obtained by depolymerization complexed with a protective mAb. Although reported data had suggested a highly complex epitope contained in a helical structure composed of more than four repeating units, we showed that such dimer conjugated to a carrier protein with a proper glycosylation degree elicited functional antibodies comparably to the full&#8208;length conjugated polysaccharide. Here, starting from the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of the polysaccharide fragment&#8211;mAb complex, we synthesized a hexasaccharide comprising exclusively the relevant positions involved in binding. Combining competitive surface plasmon resonance and saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy as well as in&#8208;silico modeling, we demonstrated that this synthetic glycan was recognized by the mAb similarly to the dimer. The hexasaccharide conjugated to CRM197, a mutant of diphtheria toxin, elicited a robust functional immune response that was not inferior to the polysaccharide conjugate, indicating that it may suffice as a vaccine antigen. This is the first evidence of an X&#8208;ray crystallography&#8208;guided design of a synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based conjugate vaccine.

      <title>Metal Oxide Nanosheets as 2D Building Blocks for the Design of Novel Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Building up: This Review article provides an overview of the synthesis of oxide nanosheets and methods to assemble them into nanocomposites, mono&#8208; or multilayer films. In particular, the use of Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett methods to form monolayer films over large surface areas, and the emerging use of ink jet printing to form patterned functional films is emphasized. The use of nanosheets in various areas of technology, for example, electronics, energy storage and tribology, is highlighted, with a special focus on their use as seed layers for epitaxial growth of thin films, and as electrochemically active electrodes for supercapacitors and Li ion batteries.







Abstract
Research into 2&#8208;dimensional materials has soared during the last couple of years. Next to van der Waals type 2D materials such as graphene and h&#8208;BN, less well&#8208;known oxidic 2D equivalents also exist. Most 2D oxide nanosheets are derived from layered metal oxide phases, although few 2D oxide phases can be also made by bottom&#8208;up solution syntheses. Owing to the strong electrostatic interactions within layered metal oxide crystals, a chemical process is usually needed to delaminate them into their 2D constituents. This Review article provides an overview of the synthesis of oxide nanosheets, and methods to assemble them into nanocomposites, mono&#8208; or multilayer films. In particular, the use of Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett methods to form monolayer films over large surface areas, and the emerging use of ink jet printing to form patterned functional films is emphasized.

The utilization of nanosheets in various areas of technology, for example, electronics, energy storage and tribology, is illustrated, with special focus on their use as seed layers for epitaxial growth of thin films, and as electrochemically active electrodes for supercapacitors and Li ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unusual Racemization of Tertiary P&#8208;Chiral Ferrocenyl Phosphines</title>
      <dc:description>
Enantiomeric excess vanished! Subjected to conventional column chromatography as highly enantioenriched compounds, P&#8208;chiral ferrocenyl phosphines suffered dramatically from racemization when collected at the column outlet even within minutes. What has happened? The authors have thoroughly investigated this most frequently used technique for the purification of such compounds and found a remarkable process as the explanation.







Abstract
Tertiary phosphines are generally known to withstand inversion under moderate conditions. In this work, a remarkable racemization process of three P&#8208;chiral ferrocenyl phosphines is reported. Subjected to conventional column chromatography as highly enantioenriched compounds, they greatly experienced racemization when collected at the column outlet within minutes. Initially, attention was drawn to this unusual inversion behavior after observing that the superb enantiomeric excess of these ligands (&gt;95&#8201;% ee in all cases) was almost lost in their corresponding ruthenium(II) complexes. Successively excluding possible racemization causes, these P&#8208;chiral ferrocenyl phosphines were found to undergo a significant, acid&#8208;catalyzed racemization process at room temperature within a few minutes. This process is mainly observed during standard column chromatography by using conventional silica or alumina, but can also be triggered deliberately by addition of certain acids. Therefore, the stereochemical preservation of P&#8208;chiral phosphines during their purification may per se not always be guaranteed, since column chromatography is the most frequently used technique for purifying such types of compounds.

      <title>2D Nanoarchitectonics: Soft Interfacial Media as Playgrounds for Microobjects, Molecular Machines, and Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic! Special focus is put on dynamic functions at liquid dynamic interfaces as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material systems. Three topics are mainly discussed: (i)&#8197;control of microobject regulations, (ii)&#8197;control of molecular machines with functions of target discrimination and optical outputs, and (iii)&#8197;control of living cells including molecular machine functions at cell membranes and cell behaviors at the liquid interface.







Abstract
Soft and flexible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) systems, such as liquid interfaces, would have much more potentials in dynamic regulation on nano&#8211;macro connected functions. In this Minireview article, we focus especially on dynamic motional functions at liquid dynamic interfaces as 2D material systems. Several recent examples are selected to be explained for overviewing features and importance of dynamic soft interfaces in a wide range of action systems. The exemplified research systems are mainly classified into three categories: (i)&#8197;control of microobjects with motional regulations; (ii)&#8197;control of molecular machines with functions of target discrimination and optical outputs; (iii)&#8197;control of living cells including molecular machine functions at cell membranes and cell/biomolecular behaviors at liquid interface. Sciences on soft 2D media with motional freedom and their nanoarchitectonics constructions will have increased importance in future technology in addition to popular rigid solid 2D materials.

      <title>A Unified and Practical Method for Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Cross&#8208;Coupling using Nickel/Photo Dual Catalysis
</title>
      <dc:description>
All in one: A general method is presented that allows for C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under one set of conditions. An iridium photosensitizer produces an excited nickel(II) complex allowing for the key reductive elimination step that allows for an expansive substrate scope.







Abstract
While carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been extensively studied, many methods are specific and limited to a particular set of substrates or functional groups. Reported here is a general method that allows for C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under one general set of conditions. We propose that an energy transfer pathway, in which an iridium photosensitizer produces an excited nickel(II) complex, is responsible for the key reductive elimination step that couples aryl bromides, iodides, and chlorides to 1&#176; and 2&#176; alcohols, amines, thiols, carbamates, and sulfonamides, and is amenable to scale up via a flow apparatus.

      <title>Controlling the Depolymerization of Paraformaldehyde with Pd&#8211;Phosphine Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
DFT: Paraformaldehyde can be used as synthesis gas (CO/H2) equivalent in catalytic carbonylation reactions. For this reason, it is important to understand its interaction with homogeneous carbonylation catalysts. By applying in situ Raman spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations we have studied the paraformaldehyde depolymerization process and found how its activation energy can be controlled by different Pd&#8211;phosphine complexes (see figure).







Abstract
Paraformaldehyde is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle chemical for the in situ generation of formaldehyde and is, therefore, often used in chemistry, structural biology, or medicine. We have investigated the depolymerization process of paraformaldehyde at different temperatures for the application as C1 surrogate in &#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. Rather surprisingly, it was found that small amounts of commonly applied carbonylation catalysts slow down the depolymerization process significantly. By applying 1H, 17O, and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy coupled with DFT calculations the inhibition process could be assigned to an electron&#8208;withdrawing coordination behavior of the Pd complex at the chain end of the paraformaldehyde chain. This inhibition process can be controlled by the utilized phosphine ligand.

      <title>Luminescent Anion Sensing by Transition&#8208;Metal Dipyridylbenzene Complexes Incorporated into Acyclic, Macrocyclic and Interlocked Hosts</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared by incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of PtII and RuII. Anion titrations with the ruthenium [2]rotaxane demonstrate a marked increase in chloride binding affinity and indicate the interlocked receptor is capable of chloride recognition even in competitive 30&#8201;% aqueous mixtures (see figure).







Abstract
A series of novel acyclic, macrocyclic and mechanically interlocked luminescent anion sensors have been prepared by incorporation of the isophthalamide motif into dipyridylbenzene to obtain cyclometallated complexes of platinum(II) and ruthenium(II). Both the acyclic and macrocyclic derivatives 7&#8901;Pt, 7&#8901;Ru&#8901;PF6, 10&#8901;Pt and 10&#8901;Ru&#8901;PF6 are effective sensors for a range of halides and oxoanions. The near&#8208;infra red emitting ruthenium congeners exhibited an increased binding strength compared to platinum due to the cationic charge and thus additional electrostatic interactions. Intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between the dipyridylbenzene ligand and the amide carbonyls increases the preorganisation of both acyclic and macrocyclic metal derivatives resulting in no discernible macrocyclic effect. Interlocked analogues were also prepared, and preliminary luminescent chloride anion spectrometric titrations with 12&#8901;Ru&#8901;(PF6)2 demonstrate a marked increase in halide binding affinity due to the complementary chloride binding pocket of the [2]rotaxane. 1H&#8197;NMR binding titrations indicate the interlocked dicationic receptor is capable of chloride recognition even in competitive 30&#8201;% aqueous mixtures.

      <title>A Regulable Internal Cavity inside a Resorcinarene&#8208;Based Hemicarcerand</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible accommodation: A resorcinarene&#8208;based capsule with a size&#8208;regulable internal cavity was realized. The alkyl chains connecting its 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms permit expansion and contraction of the cavity by demetalation and metalation. The reversible size change of the capsule enables switching of its molecular recognition properties.







Abstract
Covalent organic capsules, such as carcerands and hemicarcerands, are an interesting class of molecular hosts. These container molecules have confined spaces capable of hosting small molecules, although the fact that the size of the inner cavities cannot be changed substantially limits the scope of their applications.

     alt="A Regulable Internal Cavity inside a Resorcinarene&#8208;Based Hemicarcerand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible accommodation&lt;/b&gt;: A resorcinarene&#8208;based capsule with a size&#8208;regulable internal cavity was realized. The alkyl chains connecting its 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms permit expansion and contraction of the cavity by demetalation and metalation. The reversible size change of the capsule enables switching of its molecular recognition properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic capsules, such as carcerands and hemicarcerands, are an interesting class of molecular hosts. These container molecules have confined spaces capable of hosting small molecules, although the fact that the size of the inner cavities cannot be changed substantially limits the scope of their applications. The title covalently linked container was produced by metal&#8208;directed dimerization of a resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand having four 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms on the wide rim followed by olefin metathesis at the vertices of the resulting capsule with a second&#8208;generation Grubbs catalyst. The covalently linked bipyridyl arms permit expansion of the inner cavity by demetalation. This structural change influences the molecular recognition properties; the metal&#8208;coordinated capsule recognizes only 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl, whereas the metal&#8208;free counterpart can encapsulate not only 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl, but also 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;acetoxyphenylethynyl)benzene, which is 9.4&#8197;&#197; longer than the former guest.

      <title>Controlled Covalent Functionalization of 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 with Molecular or Polymeric Adlayers</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the reaction between 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 and maleimides is presented. The use of a base leads to the formation of a succinimide polymer layer covalently connected to MoS2. In the absence of base, functionalization stops at the molecular monolayer. The functionalization protocol is mild, fast, and very flexible (see scheme).







Abstract
Most air&#8208;stable 2D materials are relatively inert, which makes their chemical modification difficult. In particular, in the case of MoS2, the semiconducting 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 is much less reactive than its metallic counterpart, 1T&#8208;MoS2. As a consequence, there are hardly any reliable methods for the covalent modification of 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2. An ideal method for the chemical functionalization of such materials should be both mild, not requiring the introduction of a large number of defects, and versatile, allowing for the decoration with as many different functional groups as possible. Herein, a comprehensive study on the covalent functionalization of 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 with maleimides is presented. The use of a base (Et3N) leads to the in situ formation of a succinimide polymer layer, covalently connected to MoS2. In contrast, in the absence of base, functionalization stops at the molecular level. Moreover, the functionalization protocol is mild (occurs at room temperature), fast (nearly complete in 1&#8197;h), and very flexible (11&#8197;different solvents and 10&#8197;different maleimides tested). In practical terms, the procedures described here allow for the chemist to manipulate 2&#8201;H&#8208;MoS2 in a very flexible way, decorating it with polymers or molecules, and with a wide range of functional groups for subsequent modification. Conceptually, the spurious formation of an organic polymer might be general to other methods of functionalization of 2D materials, where a large excess of molecular reagents is typically used.

      <title>Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyzed Double Hydroboration of Nitriles: Application to One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Nitriles to Aldimines</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple and effective: Co(acac)2/dperphos system is employed as a precatalyst for efficient hydroboration of nitriles with HBPin to produce of N,N&#8208;diborylamines, which selectively react in situ with aldehydes to give aldimines. The overall transformation represents a synthetically valuable approach to aldimines from nitriles and can be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner, tolerating ester, lactone, carboxamide and unactivated alkene functionalities.







Abstract
The commercially available and bench&#8208;stable Co(acac)2/dpephos system is employed as a precatalyst for selective and efficient room temperature hydroboration of organic nitriles with HBPin to produce a series of N,N&#8208;diborylamines [RN(BPin)2], which react in situ with aldehydes to give aldimines. Formation of aldimines from N,N&#8208;diborylamines does not require a dehydrating agent, is applicable to a wide range of N,N&#8208;diborylamine and aldehyde substrates and is highly chemoselective, being unaffected by various common functional groups, such as alkenes, alkynes, secondary amines, ketones, esters, amides, carboxylic acids, pyridines, nitriles, and nitro compounds. The overall transformation represents a synthetically valuable approach to aldimines from nitriles and can be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner, tolerating ester, lactone, carboxamide and unactivated alkene functionalities.

      <title>Pd Nanoparticles Supported on Triangle&#8208;Shaped La2O2CO3 Nanosheets: A New Highly Efficient and Durable Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Cinnamaldehyde to Hydrocinnamaldehyde</title>
      <dc:description>
Triangular nanocatalyst: A catalyst in which Pd nanoparticles are supported on triangular La2O2CO3 nanosheets exposing predominantly the (001) planes (Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS; where TNS denotes triangular nanosheets) was prepared. It exhibits high activity and recyclability in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde.

Abstract
A catalyst in which Pd nanoparticles are supported on triangle&#8208;shaped La2O2CO3 nanosheets exposing predominantly the (001) planes (Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS; where TNS denotes triangular nanosheets) was prepared by a facile solvothermal method. The Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and recycling stability for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to hydrocinnamaldehyde with turnover frequency of up to 41&#8201;238&#8197;h&#8722;1. This enhanced activity of Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS results from strong metal&#8211;support interactions. Structure analysis and characterization demonstrated that surface&#8208;oxygen&#8208;enriched La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS supports exposing (001) planes are beneficial to charge transfer between the Pd nanoparticles and triangle&#8208;shaped La2O2CO3 nanosheets and increase the electron density of Pd. Moreover, the modulated electronic states of the Pd/La2O2CO3&#8208;TNS catalysts can enhance the adsorption and activation of hydrogen to enhance the hydrogenation activity.

The Pd/La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;TNS catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and recycling stability for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to hydrocinnamaldehyde with turnover frequency of up to 41&#8201;238&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <title>Template&#8208;Free Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Trefoil Knots and Double Trefoil Knots Featuring Cp*Rh Building Blocks
</title>
      <dc:description>
Tying the knot: A series of metallarectangles and trefoil knots featuring Cp*Rh building blocks was prepared by the template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly of different rigid and flexible ligands. Furthermore, the trefoil knots could further assemble into rare examples of double trefoil knots through coordination of the amide oxygen atoms to the secondary metal ions.







Abstract
Understanding and controlling the topology of self&#8208;assembled structures plays a fundamental role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, the preparation of a series of tetranuclear metallarectangles and hexanuclear trefoil knots featuring Cp*Rh building blocks by template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly with four different rigid and flexible ligands is described. Transformations between the trefoil knots and the corresponding macrocycles can be induced by using concentration effects. Remarkably, the hexanuclear trefoil knot 5 was shown to assemble further to provide rare examples of [12+1] heteronuclear double trefoil knots (5&#8201;a/5&#8201;b/5&#8201;c/5&#8201;d) through coordination of the amide oxygen atoms to the secondary metal ions Na+/K+/Ca2+/Cd2+. The synthetic results are supported by single&#8208;crystal XRD.

      <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of ZnO&#8211;rGO Core&#8211;Shell Nanorod Hybrids with Photo&#8208; and Electro&#8208;Catalytic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
ZnO&#8211;rGO core&#8211;shell nanorods have been prepared by a new two&#8208;step approach involving solution heating and rapid microwave irradiation. The hybrid possesses extraordinary electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity to the oxygen reduction reaction and RhB dye degradation, respectively.







Abstract
The unique two&#8208;dimensional structure and surface chemistry of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) along with its high electrical conductivity can be exploited to modify the electrochemical properties of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). ZnO&#8211;rGO nanohybrids can be engineered in a simple new two&#8208;step synthesis, which is both fast and energy&#8208;efficient. The resulting hybrid materials show excellent electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity. The structure and composition of the as&#8208;prepared bare ZnO nanorods (NRs) and the ZnO&#8211;rGO hybrids have been extensively characterised and the optical properties subsequently studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (including decay lifetime measurements). The photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine&#8197;B (RhB) dye is enhanced using the ZnO&#8211;rGO hybrids as compared to bare ZnO NRs. Furthermore, potentiometry comparing ZnO and ZnO&#8211;rGO electrodes reveals a featureless capacitive background for an Ar&#8208;saturated solution whereas for an O2&#8208;saturated solution a well&#8208;defined redox peak was observed using both electrodes. The change in reduction potential and significant increase in current density demonstrates that the hybrid core&#8211;shell NRs possess remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared to NRs of ZnO alone.

      <title>Chemical Route to Twisted Graphene, Graphene Oxide and Boron Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>
Let's twist! Covalent cross&#8208;linking of carboxylic groups of graphene through amine functional groups of the linker (trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane) as well as of amine groups of boron nitride with carboxylic groups of the linker (oxalic acid) yields twisted multilayer graphene&#8211;h&#8208;BN superlattice.







Abstract
The recently discovered twisted graphene has attracted considerable interest. A simple chemical route was found to prepare twisted graphene by covalently linking layers of exfoliated graphene containing surface carboxyl groups with an amine&#8208;containing linker (trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane). The twisted graphene shows the expected selected area electron diffraction pattern with sets of diffraction spots out with different angular spacings, unlike graphene, which shows a hexagonal pattern. Twisted multilayer graphene oxide could be prepared by the above procedure. Twisted boron nitride, prepared by cross&#8208;linking layers of boron nitride (BN) containing surface amino groups with oxalic acid linker, exhibited a diffraction pattern comparable to that of twisted graphene. First&#8208;principles DFT calculations threw light on the structures and the nature of interactions associated with twisted graphene/BN obtained by covalent linking of layers.

Here, the effect of heteroatom substitution into molecular cores of non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, containing odd&#8208;membered rings, is examined. Benzodichalcogenophene (BDC) compounds are rigid, planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, with molecular cores containing five&#8208;membered rings fused to a six&#8208;membered aryl ring. To probe the sensitivity or resilience of constructive quantum interference (CQI) in these non&#8208;bipartite molecular cores, two C2&#8208;symmetric molecules (I and II) and one asymmetric molecule (III) were investigated. I (II) contains S (O) heteroatoms in each of the five&#8208;membered rings, while III contains an S in one five&#8208;membered ring and an O in the other. Differences in their conductances arise primarily from the longer S&#8722;C and shorter O&#8722;C bond lengths compared with the C&#8722;C bond and the associated changes in their resonance integrals. Although the conductance of III is significantly lower than the conductances of the others, CQI was found to be resilient and persist in all molecules.

      <title>Dehalogenative or Deprotonative? The Preparation Pathway to the Organometallic Monomer for Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Catalyst&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Type Polymerization of Thiophene Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Polythiophene synthesis employing cross&#8208;coupling polymerization catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes is reviewed. Generation of organometallic species is available in a dehalogenative or deprotonative manner with a mono&#8208; or dihalogenated thiophene derivative, among which the deprotonative protocol shows superior atom efficiency in the polymerization.







Abstract
Due to a wide range of applications in electronic materials, polythiophenes attract considerable attention in organic and polymer syntheses as well as in materials science. For the purpose of developing the practical synthetic protocol, this review focuses on the deprotonative pathway in the preparation of thiophene organometallic monomer, which was shown to be effective employing 2&#8208;halo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted thiophene as a monomer precursor. The thus metallated thiophene monomer was shown to undergo polymerization by nickel(II) complex catalysis, with which highly regioregular head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT)&#8208;type polythiophenes were obtained with controlled molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Several polythiophene derivatives with modified thiophene&#8208;ring and side&#8208;chain structures were shown to be designed in order to achieve the designed functionality as materials.

     alt="Dehalogenative or Deprotonative? The Preparation Pathway to the Organometallic Monomer for Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Catalyst&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Type Polymerization of Thiophene Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polythiophene synthesis&lt;/b&gt; employing cross&#8208;coupling polymerization catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes is reviewed. Generation of organometallic species is available in a dehalogenative or deprotonative manner with a mono&#8208; or dihalogenated thiophene derivative, among which the deprotonative protocol shows superior atom efficiency in the polymerization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a wide range of applications in electronic materials, polythiophenes attract considerable attention in organic and polymer syntheses as well as in materials science. For the purpose of developing the practical synthetic protocol, this review focuses on the deprotonative pathway in the preparation of thiophene organometallic monomer, which was shown to be effective employing 2&#8208;halo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted thiophene as a monomer precursor. The thus metallated thiophene monomer was shown to undergo polymerization by nickel(II) complex catalysis, with which highly regioregular head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT)&#8208;type polythiophenes were obtained with controlled molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Several polythiophene derivatives with modified thiophene&#8208;ring and side&#8208;chain structures were shown to be designed in order to achieve the designed functionality as materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iron Biomineral Growth from the Initial Nucleation Seed in L&#8208;Ferritin</title>
      <dc:description>
Initial step of ferritin&#8208;assisted iron biomineralization: L&#8208;type subunits in mammalian ferritins are known to facilitate iron mineralization by providing nucleation sites but the atomic&#8208;level mechanism of the mineral formation remains elusive. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray crystallography was successfully used to observe iron cluster growth starting from an initial (&#956;3&#8208;oxo) triiron seed anchored to glutamate residues on the inner ferritin cage.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray structures of homopolymeric human L&#8208;ferritin and horse spleen ferritin were solved by freezing protein crystals at different time intervals after exposure to a ferric salt and revealed the growth of an octa&#8208;nuclear iron cluster on the inner surface of the protein cage with a key role played by some glutamate residues. An atomic resolution view of how the cluster formation develops starting from a (&#956;3&#8208;oxo)tris[(&#956;2&#8208;glutamato&#8208;&#954;O:&#954;O&#8217;)](glutamato&#8208;&#954;O)(diaquo)triiron(III) seed is provided. The results support the idea that iron biomineralization in ferritin is a process initiating at the level of the protein surface, capable of contributing coordination bonds and electrostatic guidance.

      <title>Selenolysine: A New Tool for Traceless Isopeptide Bond Formation
</title>
      <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of &#947;&#8208;selenolysine, a selenol&#8208;containing form of the commonly modified proteinogenic amino acid, lysine is reported. The utility of &#947;&#8208;selenolysine is demonstrated with the traceless ligation of the small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifier protein, SUMO&#8208;1, to a peptide segment of human glucokinase.







Abstract
Despite their biological importance, post&#8208;translationally modified proteins are notoriously difficult to produce in a homogeneous fashion by using conventional expression systems. Chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis offers a solution to this problem; however, traditional strategies often rely on sulfur&#8208;based chemistry that is incompatible with the presence of any cysteine residues in the target protein. To overcome these limitations, we present the design and synthesis of &#947;&#8208;selenolysine, a selenol&#8208;containing form of the commonly modified proteinogenic amino acid, lysine. The utility of &#947;&#8208;selenolysine is demonstrated with the traceless ligation of the small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifier protein, SUMO&#8208;1, to a peptide segment of human glucokinase. The resulting polypeptide is poised for native chemical ligation and chemoselective deselenization in the presence of unprotected cysteine residues. Selenolysine's straightforward synthesis and incorporation into synthetic peptides marks it as a universal handle for conjugating any ubiquitin&#8208;like modifying protein to its target.

      <title>Multicomponent Self&#8208;Assembly of PdII/PtII Interlocked Molecular Cages: Cage&#8208;to&#8208;Cage Conversion and Self&#8208;Sorting in Aqueous Medium</title>
      <dc:description>
Arm in arm: Hexanuclear interlocked cages of PdII/PtII were synthesized by multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of cis&#8208;blocked Pt/Pd acceptors in combination with a mixture of tripodal flexible and rigid donors.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is an efficient approach for constructing complicated molecules with the aid of reversible bond formation. However, constructing topologically complicated interlocked systems and their formation studies remain challenging tasks. The formation of two water&#8208;soluble hexanuclear interlocked cages by multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of a flexible triimidazole donor (L1) and a rigid tripyridyl donor (L2) based on a triazine core in combination with 90&#176; cis&#8208;blocked PdII and PtII acceptors is reported here. Formation of interlocked systems having a composition of M6(L1)2(L2)2 (M=Pd or Pt) becomes feasible through cavity&#8208;induced self&#8208;recognition of two similar units having a composition of M3(L1)(L2). Self&#8208;sorting of two independently prepared cages of [M3(L1)2] and [M6(L2)4] in aqueous medium leads to the formation of interlocked systems, and their formation was monitored by time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Self&#8208;recognition of L1 by [M6(L2)4] or L2 by [M3(L1)2] leads to the formation of interlocked systems, as confirmed from 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic titrations of L1 with cages {M6(L2)4} and L2 with {M3(L1)2}, respectively. Both the interlocked cages of Pd and Pt are highly stable, and formation of either system is equally probable as observed from the treatments of Pd3(L1)2 with Pt6(L2)4 or Pt3(L1)2 with Pd6(L2)4, which lead to the formation of two different self&#8208;assembled homometallic interlocked cages [Pt6(L1)2(L2)2+Pd6(L1)2(L2)2] instead of forming any other heterometallic assemblies. Formation of interlocked cages is dependent on the steric bulk of the diamine ligand bound to the metal acceptors. A N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted blocking amine prefers the non&#8208;interlocked cage instead of the interlocked analogue.

      <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized MoS2 Interfacing Polymer Carbon Nanodots with Electrocatalytic Activity for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Facile and fast: A facile and fast bottom&#8208;up approach involving thermal decomposition of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and the in situ complexation of Mo with carboxyl groups on the surface of polymer carbon nanodots (PCNDs) was used to prepare a hybrid material consisting of MoS2 and PCNDs. The thus&#8208;obtained MoS2&#8208;PCND electrocatalyst showed superior activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction and outperformed the corresponding material acquired by a top&#8208;down approach.







Abstract
The preparation of an MoS2&#8211;polymer carbon nanodot (MoS2&#8208;PCND) hybrid material was accomplished by employing an easy and fast bottom&#8208;up synthetic approach. Specifically, MoS2&#8208;PCND was realized by the thermal decomposition of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and the in situ complexation of Mo with carboxylic acid units present on the surface of PCNDs. The newly prepared hybrid material was comprehensively characterized by spectroscopy, thermal means, and electron microscopy. The electrocatalytic activity of MoS2&#8208;PCND was examined in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and compared with that of the corresponding hybrid material prepared by a top&#8208;down approach, namely MoS2&#8208;PCND(exf&#8208;fun), in which MoS2 was firstly exfoliated and then covalently functionalized with PCNDs. The MoS2&#8208;PCND hybrid material showed superior electrocatalytic activity toward the HER with low Tafel slope, excellent electrocatalytic stability, and an onset potential of &#8722;0.16&#8197;V versus RHE. The superior catalytic performance of MoS2&#8208;PCND was rationalized by considering the catalytically active sites of MoS2, the effective charge/energy&#8208;transfer phenomena from PCNDs to MoS2, and the synergetic effect between MoS2 and PCNDs in the hybrid material.

The superior catalytic performance of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;PCND was rationalized by considering the catalytically active sites of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the effective charge/energy&#8208;transfer phenomena from PCNDs to MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the synergetic effect between MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PCNDs in the hybrid material.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of Structural Complexity through Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecules Containing Rodlike Components</title>
      <dc:description>
One block at a time: Rodlike molecular building blocks have emerged as one of the most promising building blocks for constructing functional materials. This Review highlights developments in the rational design of molecules containing rodlike components to achieve unconventional self&#8208;assembled structures. Special attention is paid to recent progress in the &#8220;molecular Lego&#8221; approach.







Abstract
Hierarchical structures are important for transferring and amplifying molecular functions to macroscopic properties of materials. In this regard, rodlike molecules have emerged as one of the most promising molecular building blocks to construct functional materials. Although the self&#8208;assembly of conventional molecules containing rodlike components generally results in nematic or layered smectic phases, due to the preferred parallel arrangements of rodlike components, extensive efforts have revealed that rational molecular design provides a versatile platform to engineer rich self&#8208;assembled structures. Herein, first successes achieved in polyphilic liquid crystals and rod&#8211;coil block systems are summarized. Special attention is paid to recent progress in the conjugation of rodlike building blocks with other molecular building blocks through the molecular Lego approach. Rod&#8208;based giant surfactants, sphere&#8211;rod conjugates, and dendritic rodlike molecules are covered. Future perspectives of the self&#8208;assembly of molecules containing rodlike components are also provided.

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylenes as Ligands in Transition Metal Carbonyl Chemistry: Nature of their Bonding and Supposed Innocence</title>
      <dc:description>A study on the reactivity of the N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene Dipp2NHSi with the transition metal complexes [Ni(CO)4], [M(CO)6] (M= Cr, Mo, W), [Mn(CO)5(Br)] and [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe(CO)2(I)] is reported. We demonstrate that NHSis, the higher homologues of the now ubiquitous NHC ligands, show a remarkably different behavior compared to NHC ligands. Calculations on the features of these ligands revealed differences in the frontier orbital region which lead to some peculiarities of their coordination chemistry, as demonstrated by the synthesis of dinuclear, NHSi&#8208;bridged [{Ni(CO)2(&#956;&#8208;Dipp2NHSi)}2] (2), &#160;[M(CO)5(Dipp2NHSi)] (M = Cr 3, Mo 4, W 5), [Mn(CO)3(Dipp2NHSi)2(Br)] (9) and [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe(CO)2(Dipp2NHSi&#8208;I)] (10). DFT calculations on model systems [Ni(L)], [Ni(CO)3(L)], and [W(CO)5(L)] (L = NHC, NHSi) reveal that carbenes are typically better donor ligands with a larger intrinsic strength of the metal&#8208;ligand bond. The decrease going from NHC to NHSi ligand is mainly caused by favorable electrostatic contributions for the NHC ligand to the total bond strength, whereas the orbital interactions were often found to be higher for the silylene complexes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the contribution of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;interaction depends significantly on the system under investigation. The &#963;&#8208;interaction is often much weaker for the NHSi ligand compared to NHC but, interestingly, the &#960;&#8208;interaction prevails for many NHSi complexes. For the carbonyl complexes, the NHSi ligand is the better &#963;&#8208;donor ligand, and contributions of &#960;&#8208;symmetry play only a minor role for the NHC and NHSi co&#8208;ligands.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The reactions of the fluoride&#8208;ion donor, XeF6, with the fluoride&#8208;ion acceptors, M'OF4  (M' = Cr, Mo, W), yield [XeF5]+  and [Xe2F11]+  salts of [M'OF5]&#8211;  and [M2O2F9]&#8211;  (M = Mo, W).

      <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics and demand of high anodic potential are the bottlenecks for OER&#160;that severely hamper the deployment of water splitting modules for H  2  production.

Herein, we report the controlled assembly of transition metal oxides i.e., Cu@CuO  x  nanoclusters (NCs, &#8776; 2nm) and Co@CoO  x  beaded nanoclusters (BNCs, &#8776;2nm) on thiol&#8208;functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets as novel and highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER. Thiol&#160;functionality was incorporated  via  selective epoxidation reaction on the surface of graphene oxide&#160;to achieve chemically exfoliated nanosheets to enhance its conductivity and trapping ability for metal oxides NCs.

      <title>Efficiency of Site&#8208;Specific Clicked Laccase&#8211;Carbon Nanotubes Biocathodes towards O2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A maximization of a direct electron transfer between redox enzymes and electrodes can be obtained through oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. In this work, a strategy for obtaining carbon nanotube based electrodes covalently modified with perfectly control&#8208;oriented fungal laccases is presented.







Abstract
A maximization of a direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and electrodes can be obtained through the oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. Here, a strategy for obtaining carbon nanotube (CNTs) based electrodes covalently modified with perfectly control&#8208;oriented fungal laccases is presented. Modelizations of the laccase&#8208;CNT interaction and of electron conduction pathways serve as a guide in choosing grafting positions. Homogeneous populations of alkyne&#8208;modified laccases are obtained through the reductive amination of a unique surface&#8208;accessible lysine residue selectively engineered near either one or the other of the two copper centers in enzyme variants. Immobilization of the site&#8208;specific alkynated enzymes is achieved by copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction on azido&#8208;modified CNTs. A highly efficient reduction of O2 at low overpotential and catalytic current densities over &#8722;3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are obtained by minimizing the distance from the electrode surface to the trinuclear cluster.

      <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by water splitting is highly important for the applications of hydrogen energy and the replacement of fossil fuel using solar energy, which needs the development of efficient catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic stability under light irradiation in aqueous solution. Herein, we synthesized Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S solid solution using a metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;template strategy and then loaded MoS  2  &#160;by a hydrothermal method to fabricate MoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The composition of MoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S was fine&#8208;tuned to obtain the optimized 5 wt% MoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S heterojunction that showed a superior hydrogen evolution rate of 23.80 mmol h  &#8208;1  &#160;g  &#8208;1  and steadily photocatalytic stability over 25 hours. The photocatalytic activity is from the appropriate composition and the formation of intimate interface between MoS  2  &#160;and Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S, which endows the photocatalyst with high light&#8208;harvesting ability and effective separation of photogenerated carriers.</dc:description>

      <title>Multimeric Presentation of RGD Peptidomimetics Enhances Integrin Binding and Tumor Cell Uptake</title>
      <dc:description>The use of multimeric ligands is considered as a promising strategy to improve tumor targeting for diagnosis and therapy. Herein, tetrameric RGD peptidomimetics were designed to target &#945;  v  &#946;  3  integrin&#8208;expressing tumor cells. These compounds were prepared  via  an oxime chemoselective assembly of  cyclo  (DKP&#8208;RGD) ligands and a cyclodecapeptide scaffold that allows a tetrameric presentation.

      <title>Assessing Crystallisation Kinetics of Zr Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Turbidity Measurements to Inform Rapid Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the crystallisation of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), network solids of metal ions or clusters connected by organic ligands, is often hindered by the significant number of synthetic variables inherent to their synthesis. Coordination modulation, the addition of monotopic competing ligands to solvothermal syntheses, can allow tuning of physical properties (particle size, porosity, surface chemistry), enhance crystallinity, and select desired phases, by modifying the kinetics of self&#8208;assembly, but its mechanism(s) are poorly understood. Herein, we use turbidity measurements to assess the effects of modulation on the solvothermal synthesis of the prototypical Zr terephthalate MOF UiO&#8208;66 and apply the knowledge gained to its rapid microwave synthesis. The studied experimental parameters &#8208; temperature, reagent concentration, reagent aging, metal precursor, water content, and modulator addition &#8208; all influence the time taken for onset of nucleation, and subsequently allow microwave synthesis of UiO&#8208;66 in as little as one minute. The simple, low cost turbidity measurements align closely with previously reported  in situ  synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, proving their simplicity and utility for probing the nucleation of complex materials while offering significant insights to the synthetic chemist.</dc:description>

      <title>WS2/MoS2 Heterostructures through Thermal Treatment of MoS2 Layers Electrostatically Functionalized with W3S4 Molecular Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Stacked layers: The reported simple and scalable chemical strategy for the preparation of WS2/MoS2 stacked layers gives rise to clean heterostructures with strong interlayer interaction. MoS2 flakes with a negatively charged surface are functionalized with a cationic W cluster, which undergoes a dry thermal decomposition into thin WS2 layers. The quenching of the photoluminescence signal in the prepared heterostructure proves an efficient interlayer coupling.







Abstract
The preparation of 2D stacked layers combining flakes of different nature gives rise to countless numbers of heterostructures where new band alignments, defined at the interfaces, control the electronic properties of the system. Among the large family of 2D/2D heterostructures, the one formed by the combination of the most common semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, WS2/MoS2, has awakened great interest owing to its photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties. Solution as well as dry physical methods have been developed to optimize the synthesis of these heterostructures. Here, a suspension of negatively charged MoS2 flakes is mixed with a methanolic solution of a cationic W3S4&#8208;core cluster, giving rise to a homogeneous distribution of the clusters over the layers. In a second step, a calcination of this molecular/2D heterostructure under N2 leads to the formation of clean WS2/MoS2 heterostructures, where the photoluminescence of both counterparts is quenched, proving an efficient interlayer coupling. Thus, this chemical method combines the advantages of a solution approach (simple, scalable, and low&#8208;cost) with the good quality interfaces reached by using more complicated traditional physical methods.

MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakes with a negatively charged surface are functionalized with a cationic W cluster, which undergoes a dry thermal decomposition into thin WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. The quenching of the photoluminescence signal in the prepared heterostructure proves an efficient interlayer coupling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of 2D stacked layers combining flakes of different nature gives rise to countless numbers of heterostructures where new band alignments, defined at the interfaces, control the electronic properties of the system. Among the large family of 2D/2D heterostructures, the one formed by the combination of the most common semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, has awakened great interest owing to its photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties. Solution as well as dry physical methods have been developed to optimize the synthesis of these heterostructures. Here, a suspension of negatively charged MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakes is mixed with a methanolic solution of a cationic W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;core cluster, giving rise to a homogeneous distribution of the clusters over the layers. In a second step, a calcination of this molecular/2D heterostructure under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the formation of clean WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures, where the photoluminescence of both counterparts is quenched, proving an efficient interlayer coupling. Thus, this chemical method combines the advantages of a solution approach (simple, scalable, and low&#8208;cost) with the good quality interfaces reached by using more complicated traditional physical methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enhanced and Heteromolecular Guest Encapsulation in Nonporous Crystals of a Perfluorinated Triketonato Dinuclear Copper Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Guest encapsulation: A perfluorinated dinuclear complex, comprised of a Cu2O6 core and four pentafluorophenyl groups, was prepared and the crystal encapsulates various benzene derivatives. The number of guest molecules found in the crystal was higher than that in the corresponding mononuclear complex and a new type of heteromolecular guest encapsulation was achieved.







Abstract
The flexible host framework of a perfluorinated mononuclear copper complex, [Cu(L1)2] (1, HL1=3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;propen&#8208;1&#8208;one), with a CuO4 core reversibly encapsulated several organic guest molecules through electrostatic interactions in its crystals. Hence, the corresponding dinuclear complex, [Cu2(L2)2] (2, H2L2=1,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,5&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;pentadien&#8208;3&#8208;one), was prepared to enhance guest recognition and the ability to separate molecular mixtures. Complex 2 comprises a Cu2O6 core and four pentafluorophenyl groups. In crystal 2, cavities are formed on the axial sites of the metal core that are surrounded by pentafluorophenyl groups. The crystal of 2 encapsulates various guest molecules, that is, benzene (3), toluene (4), xylene (5), mesitylene (6), durene (7), and anisole (8). X&#8208;ray crystallographic and thermogravimetric (TG) studies show that three guest molecules are present in the crystal cavities. The number of guest molecules found in complex 2 was higher than that in complex 1, for example, (2)3&#8901;(6)10&gt;1&#8901;(6)2, (2)2&#8901;(7)7&gt;1&#8901;7, or 2&#8901;(8)3&gt;1&#8901;(8)2. Naphthalene (9), was encapsulated in 2 to give 2&#8901;(9)3, but not in 1. In the crystal of complex 2, heteromolecular guest encapsulation was confirmed, designated as 2&#8901;(3)2&#8901;9. TG analysis indicates that the thermal stability of the guest&#8208;included crystals of 2 is higher than that of 1.

Abstract
Electrosynthesis of 2H&#8208;2&#8208;(aryl)benzo[d]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and their N&#8208;oxides from 2&#8208;nitroazobenzene derivatives is reported. The electrolysis is conducted in a very simple undivided cell under constant current conditions with a leaded bronze cathode and a glassy carbon anode. The product distribution between 2H&#8208;2&#8208;(aryl)benzo[d]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and their N&#8208;oxides can be guided by simply controlling the current density and the amount of the charge applied. The reaction tolerates several sensitive functional groups in reductive electrochemistry. The usefulness and the applicability of the synthetic method is demonstrated by a formal synthesis of an antiviral compound.

      <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Janus Fluorographene Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Janus graphene nanosheets with hydroxyl groups on one side and fluorine atoms on the other were obtained by a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction. When graphene is dispersed in water, the nanosheets simultaneously adopt an arrangement driven by the hydroxyl groups, whereas when dispersed in nonpolar solvents, such as chloroform, the arrangement of layers is governed by the hydrophobic nature of C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Fluorographene, a two&#8208;dimensional derivative of graphene, is an excellent starting material for the synthesis of graphene derivatives. In this work, a one&#8208;step, substrate&#8208;free method for the asymmetric functionalization of fluorographene layers with hydroxyl groups by a facile nucleophilic substitution reaction is reported. Such a chemical modification occurs in a biphasic aqueous&#8211;organic system under mild conditions, leading to Janus graphene nanosheets functionalized by hydroxyl groups on one side and retaining fluorine atoms on the other. The reported experimental route paves the way for two&#8208;dimensional bifacial graphene templates, thus broadening the application potential of graphene materials.

      <title>Competitive Reactivity of Tautomers in the Degradation of Organophosphates by Imidazole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Making pesticides safer: The harmful impact of pesticides on human health and the environment necessitates the development of efficient degradation processes. Both inductive effects and hydrogen bonding by the substituents on imidazole derivatives are shown to influence barriers and reaction mechanisms of these catalyst scaffolds for the detoxification of organophosphates.







Abstract
The harmful impact caused by pesticides on human health and the environment necessitates the development of efficient degradation processes and control of prohibited stocks of such substances. Organophosphates (OPs) are among the most used agrochemicals in the world and their degradation can proceed through several possible pathways. Investigating the reactivity of OPs with nucleophilic species allows one to propose new and efficient catalyst scaffolds for use in detoxification. In light of the remarkable catalytic activity of imidazole (IMZ) at promoting dephosphorylation processes of OPs, the reactivity of 4(5)&#8208;hydroxymethylimidazole (HMZ) with diethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrophenylphosphate (DEDNPP) and Paraoxon are evaluated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. It is observed that HMZ is an efficient and regiospecific catalyst with reactivity modulated by competing tautomers. To propose an optimal IMZ&#8208;based catalyst, quantum chemical calculations were performed for monosubstituted 4(5)IMZ derivatives that might cleave DEDNPP. Both inductive effects and hydrogen bonding by the substituents are shown to influence barriers and mechanisms.

In a spin: Structurally different [ML2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (L=2,6&#8208;bis[5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]&#8208;pyridine; M=Fe, Cu or Zn) form the same anhydrous phase on annealing, which transforms to one of two new phases near room temperature. [ZnL2][BF4]2 shows unusual structural changes between 285&#8211;150&#8197;K, which are duplicated in its iron analogue by powder diffraction. This will contribute to the previously reported 65&#8197;K thermal hysteresis in the spin&#8208;transition shown by [FeL2][BF4]2.







Abstract
Annealing [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (L=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]pyridine) affords an anhydrous material, which undergoes a spin transition at T1/2=205&#8197;K with a 65&#8197;K thermal hysteresis loop. This occurs through a sequence of phase changes, which were monitored by powder diffraction in an earlier study. [CuL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O and [ZnL2][BF4]2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O are not perfectly isostructural but, unlike the iron compound, they undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal dehydration upon annealing. All the annealed compounds initially adopt the same tetragonal phase but undergo a phase change near room temperature upon re&#8208;cooling. The low&#8208;temperature phase of [CuL2][BF4]2 involves ordering of its Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, to a monoclinic lattice with three unique cation sites. The zinc compound adopts a different, triclinic low&#8208;temperature phase with significant twisting of its coordination sphere, which unexpectedly becomes more pronounced as the crystal is cooled. Synchrotron powder diffraction data confirm that the structural changes in the anhydrous zinc complex are reproduced in the high&#8208;spin iron compound, before the onset of spin&#8208;crossover. This will contribute to the wide hysteresis in the spin transition of the iron complex. EPR spectra of copper&#8208;doped [Fe0.97Cu0.03L2][BF4]2 imply its low&#8208;spin phase contains two distinct cation environments in a 2:1 ratio.

      <title>Evidence for Electron Transfer between Graphene and Non&#8208; covalently Bound &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Hybridizing graphene and molecules possess a high potential for developing materials for new applications. However, new methods to characterize such hybrids must be developed. Herein, we present the wet&#8208;chemical non&#8208;covalent functionalization of graphene with cationic &#960;&#8208;systems and characterize the interaction between graphene and the molecules in detail. A series of tricationic benzimidazolium salts with various steric demand and counterions was synthesized, characterized and used for the fabrication of graphene hybrids. Subsequently, the doping effects were studied. The molecules are adsorbed onto graphene and studied by Raman spectroscopy, XPS as well as ToF&#8208;SIMS. The charged &#960;&#8208;systems show a p&#8208;doping effect on the underlying graphene. Consequently, the tricationic molecules are reduced&#160; via&#160; a partial electron transfer process from graphene, a process which is accompanied by the loss of counterions. DFT calculations support this hypothesis and the strong p&#8208;doping could be confirmed in fabricated monolayer graphene/hybride FET devices. The results are the basis to develop sensor applications, which are based on analyte/molecule interactions and effects on doping.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise Oxidations in a Cofacial Copper(II) Porphyrin Dimer: Through Space Spin Coupling and Interplay between Metal and Radical spins</title>
      <dc:description>Cis and trans&#8208;copper(II) porphyrin dimers have been synthesized in which two Cu(II) porphyrin macrocycles are bridged through a rigid ethene&#8208;linker for possible through&#8208;space and through&#8208;bond spin&#8208;couplings between the paramagnetic Cu(II) centers. It has been found that the two macrocycles come closer after 1e&#8208;oxidation which, however, move far apart upon further 1e&#8208;oxidation leading to transformation of the cis to trans isomer. Detailed investigations are performed here on the interactions between the two porphyrin macrocycles, between two unpaired spins of closely&#8208;spaced Cu(II) centers and also between the unpaired spins of metal and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. Spectroscopic investigations along with X&#8208;ray structure of the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex displayed strong electronic communications through the bridge between two porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. The counter anion I9&#8211; is stabilized in an unusual trigonal pyramidal structure in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex; the central iodide ion is bound with four iodine (I2) molecules. Variable temperature magnetic study revealed strong anti&#8208;ferromagnetic coupling between the two porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical spins (Jr&#8208;r) in the 2e&#8211; oxidized complex. DFT calculations suggest stabilization of the triplet state which is also in good agreement with the experiment.

      <title>Extraction of graphene nanostructures from Colocasia esculenta and Nelumbo nucifera leaves and surface functionalization with tin oxide: Evaluation of their antibacterial properties</title>
      <dc:description>Expeditious evolution of antimicrobial resistance in recent years has been identified as a growing concern by various health organizations around the world. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign production of highly antibacterial carbonaceous nanomaterials from  Colocasia esculenta  and  Nelumbo nucifera  leaves for the first time. After carbonization and oxidative treatment, smaller graphene domains are formed in  Colocasia esculenta  derivatives whereas larger sheet&#8208;like structures are spotted in the case of  Nelumbo nucifera  . Smaller particle size makes quantum confinement effects more prominent as evident in fine tuning of photoluminescence emission after each stage of treatment. We also demonstrate the influence of precursor materials in dictating the antibacterial properties of nano&#8208;systems. When microbicidal activity was tested against model bacteria  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  , nanocomposite derived from  Colocasia esculenta  leaves displayed higher activity than the antibiotic drug Clarithromycin (control) with a measured zone of inhibition of 40 &#177; 0.5 mm. This is one of the highest values reported in comparison with other plant&#8208;based carbon&#8208;silver nano&#8208;systems. From quantitative analysis, it is discerned that nanocomposite obtained from  Colocasia esculenta  leaves has antimicrobial efficacy equivalent to commercial antibiotic drugs and is able to eradicate bacteria at much lower concentrations when compared to those from  Nelumbo nucifera  leaves.</dc:description>

      <title>Linear and Star&#8208;Shaped Extended Di&#8208; and Tristyrylbenzenes: Synthesis, Characterization and Optical Response to Acid and Metal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>Two linear 1,4&#8208;distyrylbenzenes and five star&#8208;shaped 1,3,5&#8208;tristyrylbenzene derivatives (L2a&#8208;L2b, Y0&#8208;Y3 and YNBu) were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. The photophysical properties, optical response to acid and metal ions were investigated. Upon backbone extension of linear distyrylbenzenes or the introduction of dibutylanilines, the electronic spectra are red&#8208;shifted. Incorporation of electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl units does not significantly affect the optical properties. Variation of the number of pyridine rings and substitution pattern tune the fluorescence response to acids and metal ions. The novel arenes discriminate Al3+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Ag+ and Hg2+.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two linear 1,4&#8208;distyrylbenzenes and five star&#8208;shaped 1,3,5&#8208;tristyrylbenzene derivatives (L2a&#8208;L2b, Y0&#8208;Y3 and YNBu) were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. The photophysical properties, optical response to acid and metal ions were investigated. Upon backbone extension of linear distyrylbenzenes or the introduction of dibutylanilines, the electronic spectra are red&#8208;shifted. Incorporation of electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl units does not significantly affect the optical properties. Variation of the number of pyridine rings and substitution pattern tune the fluorescence response to acids and metal ions. The novel arenes discriminate Al3+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Ag+ and Hg2+.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Optically Triggered Control of the Charge Carrier Density in Chemically Functionalized Graphene Field Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Optically switchable graphene FET: Via van der Waals assembly of an approximately 1&#8197;nm thick azobenzene functionalized molecular nanosheets with single layer graphene, optically responsive field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated. The electrical carrier density of these devices can be modulated using optical stimuli, 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules. The azobenzene molecules were incorporated to the GFET channel by building a van der Waals heterostructure with a carbon nanomembrane (CNM), which is used as a molecular interposer to attach the azobenzene molecules. Under exposure with 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light, azobenzene molecules transition between cis and trans molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment. Thus, the effective electric field acting on the GFET channel is tuned by optical stimulation and the carrier density is modulated.

      <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 4&#8197;GPa and 1150&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was determined from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation.

Abstract
Barium imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized at 5&#8197;GPa and 1000&#8201;&#176;C with a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique. Ba(N3)2, P3N5 and NH4Cl were used as starting materials, applying a combination of azide and mineralizer routes. The structure elucidation of BaP6N10NH (P63, a=7.5633(11), c=8.512(2)&#8197;&#197;, Z=2) was performed by a combination of transmission electron microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Phase purity was verified by Rietveld refinement. 1H and 31P solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy are consistent with the structure model. The chemical composition was confirmed by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and CHNS analyses. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of BaP6N10NH show blue emission upon excitation with UV to blue light (&#955;em=460&#8197;nm, fwhm=2423&#8197;cm&#8722;1) representing unprecedented Eu2+&#8208;luminescence of an imidonitride.

      <title>Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;Azaproline Creates Conformationally Adaptable Proline Derivatives for pH&#8208;Responsive Collagen Triple Helices</title>
      <dc:description>
Swings both ways: Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;azaproline creates pH&#8208;responsive amino acids that change their conformation in different chemical environments through the invertibility of nitrogen. Incorporation into collagen triple helices highlighted the conformational flexibility of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline and demonstrated its potential as a novel apparatus for the functionalization of peptides and proteins.







Abstract
C&#947;&#8208;substituted proline derivatives are valuable tools for developing functionalized collagen peptides for biological and materials investigations, yet the stereochemistry at C&#947; can produce undesired steric or stereoelectronic constraints. Alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline (&#947;&#8208;azPro) derivatives are proline mimetics that lack a stereogenic center at the &#947;&#8208;position of the ring and can thus utilize the invertibility of nitrogen to adapt their conformation. NMR spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations highlighted how alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro derivatives are conformationally dynamic and adopt conformational preferences through ring pucker flip along with nitrogen inversion. Lastly, incorporation of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro into collagen peptides produced functionalized pH&#8208;responsive triple helices with similar thermal stabilities, regardless of their placement in the Xaa or Yaa position within the characteristic Xaa&#8208;Yaa&#8208;Gly repeating unit of collagen peptides.

     alt="Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;Azaproline Creates Conformationally Adaptable Proline Derivatives for pH&#8208;Responsive Collagen Triple Helices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swings both ways&lt;/b&gt;: Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;azaproline creates pH&#8208;responsive amino acids that change their conformation in different chemical environments through the invertibility of nitrogen. Incorporation into collagen triple helices highlighted the conformational flexibility of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline and demonstrated its potential as a novel apparatus for the functionalization of peptides and proteins.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;&#947;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;substituted proline derivatives are valuable tools for developing functionalized collagen peptides for biological and materials investigations, yet the stereochemistry at C&lt;sup&gt;&#947;&lt;/sup&gt; can produce undesired steric or stereoelectronic constraints. Alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline (&#947;&#8208;azPro) derivatives are proline mimetics that lack a stereogenic center at the &#947;&#8208;position of the ring and can thus utilize the invertibility of nitrogen to adapt their conformation. NMR spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations highlighted how alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro derivatives are conformationally dynamic and adopt conformational preferences through ring pucker flip along with nitrogen inversion. Lastly, incorporation of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro into collagen peptides produced functionalized pH&#8208;responsive triple helices with similar thermal stabilities, regardless of their placement in the Xaa or Yaa position within the characteristic Xaa&#8208;Yaa&#8208;Gly repeating unit of collagen peptides.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Carborane modification: Efficient RhI&#8208;catalyzed phosphine&#8208;directed B3&#8208;arylation, B3,B6&#8208;diarylation, and B3,B6&#8208;dialkylation of o&#8208;carboranes to synthesize a series of functionalized monophosphino&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes is reported. Upon switching RhI to PdII, selective C&#8208;arylated and B6&#8208;halogenated products were afforded by using tBuOLi and Li2CO3 as base, respectively.







Abstract
A facile approach to the synthesis of diaryl&#8208; and dialkyl&#8208;substituted monophosphino&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes by rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed phosphine&#8208;directed B3,6&#8722;H activation has been developed for the first time. Upon switching rhodium(I) to palladium(II), C&#8208;arylated and B6&#8208;halogenated products were obtained by using tBuOLi and Li2CO3 as base, respectively. These discoveries provide some simple and efficient approaches to the modification of monophosphino&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes.

      <title>A Maltol&#8208;Containing Ruthenium Polypyridyl Complex as a Potential Anticancer Agent
</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium versus platinum: The synthesis and characterisation of the potential chemotherapeutic agent [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) (DIP=4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline, mal=maltol) is described. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that the compound has higher activity than cisplatin. It is efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affects the mitochondrial metabolism.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Chemotherapy, despite its severe side effects, is to date one of the leading strategies against cancer. Metal&#8208;based drugs present several potential advantages when compared to organic compounds and they have gained trust from the scientific community after the approval on the market of the drug cisplatin. Recently, we reported the ruthenium complex ([Ru(DIP)2(sq)](PF6) (where DIP is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline and sq is semiquinonate) with a remarkable potential as chemotherapeutic agent against cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we analyse a structurally similar compound, namely [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), carrying the flavour&#8208;enhancing agent approved by the FDA, maltol (mal). To possess an FDA approved ligand is crucial for a complex, whose mechanism of action might include ligand exchange. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), its stability in solutions and under conditions that resemble the physiological ones, and its in&#8208;depth biological investigation. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines in 2D model and on HeLa MultiCellular Tumour Spheroids (MCTS) demonstrated that our compound has higher activity than cisplatin, inspiring further tests. [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) was efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affected the mitochondrial metabolism.

      <title>Yldiide Ligands as Building Blocks for Polynuclear Coinage Metal Complexes: Metal Squares, Triangles and Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Yldiides have unique electronic properties and donor abilities, but as ligands in transition metal complexes they are scarcely represented in the literature. Here, the controlled synthesis of a series of polynuclear gold yldiide complexes derived from triphenyl(cyanomethyl)phosphonium bromide, [Ph 3  PCH 2  CN]Br, under mild conditions is described. Anionic dinuclear NBu4  [(AuX) 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] (X = Cl, C 6  F 5  ) or trinuclear derivatives NBu 4  [Au 3  X 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] bearing terminal chloride or pentafluorophenyl groups and bridging yldiide ligands have been prepared. These compounds evolve in solution giving rise to the formation of an unprecedented tetrameric gold cluster, [Au 4  {C(CN)PPh 3  } 4  ], by the loss of the gold complex NBu 4  [AuX 2  ]. This gold cluster can also be prepared in high yield by a transmetallation reaction from the analogous tetrameric silver cluster, and two geometric isomers have been characterised, their formation dependent on the synthetic route. The  ligand has also been used to build different dinuclear and trinuclear cationic complexes bearing phosphine or diphosphine ancillary ligands and bridging yldiide moieties. Further coordination through the cyano group of the yldiide ligand gives heterometallic trinuclear or pentanuclear derivatives. Structural characterisation of many of these compounds reveals the presence of complex molecular systems stabilised by gold&#183;&#183;&#183;gold interactions and bridging yldiide ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly methyl methacrylate&#8208;assisted exfoliation of graphite and its use in acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites</title>
      <dc:description>One of the applications of graphene in which its scalable production is of utmost importance is the development of polymer composites. Among the techniques used to produce graphene flakes, the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite stands out due to its versatility and scalability. However, the solvents suitable for the LPE process are generally toxic and have a high boiling point, making the processing challenging. The use of low boiling point solvents could be convenient for the processing, due to the easiness of their removal.
In this study, we propose the use of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a stabilizing agent for the production of graphene flakes in a low boiling point solvent,  i.e.,  acetone. The graphene dispersions produced in the mixture acetone&#8208;PMMA increases the concentration by +175&#160;%, and contain a higher percentage of few&#8209;layer graphene flakes (&lt;&#160;5&#160;layers)  , e.g.,  +60&#160;%, compared to the dispersions prepared in acetone. The as&#8208;produced graphene dispersions are used to develop graphene/acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites. The mechanical properties of the pristine polymer are improved,  i.e  ., +&#160;22&#160;% in the Young&#8217;s modulus, by adding 0.01&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes. Moreover, a decrease of ~&#160;20&#160;% in the oxygen permeability is obtained using 0.1&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes filler, compared to the unloaded matrix.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfonated Pyrene as a Photoregulator for Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Looping</title>
      <dc:description>
Loop&#8208;control system: The water&#8208;soluble sulfonated pyrene derivative SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator for the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). By observing the formation rate of the SPy dimer radical cation after photoionization, the looping kinetics of doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNA was revealed. Reducing the SPy dimer radical cation makes it possible to realize controlled unlooping.







Abstract
Controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules through photoregulators holds great promise as a spatiotemporally controllable tool for disease control. In addition, introducing photoregulators into biomolecules has also found applications in constructing smart nanomaterials. In spite of the astonishing advances that have been made in the past few years, realizing highly controllable and efficient regulation over the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions is still challenging. Herein, sulfonated pyrene SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator to control the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in aqueous solution. Due to its water solubility, SPy merits use in the study of biomolecules in aqueous solution. The looping of the doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNAs is stimulated by irradiation and regulated by SPy. Photoionization generates the radical cation of SPy (SPy.+). The association of SPy.+ with its neutral counterpart, SPy, gives rise to the dimer radical cation of SPy (SPy2.+). During the association process, the stabilization energy released to form SPy2.+ provides a driving force for the looping of ssDNAs. Conversely, the formed loop conformations were trapped by the formation of SPy2.+, and this allowed the looping dynamics to be investigated. The results reported herein suggest potential of SPy as a photoregulator for controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing with an Aptamer&#8208;Containing DNA Primer</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosensors: We demonstrate the ability to detect protein targets in solution and on paper&#8208;based sensors using a target&#8208;binding aptamer as a primer for rolling circle amplification (RCA). Binding of the target protein to the aptamer prevents the aptamer from binding a circular templet, inhibiting the initiation of the RCA process, which can be followed using a simple fluorescence assay (see figure).







Abstract
We report a method to detect proteins via suppression of rolling circle amplification (RCA) by using an appropriate aptamer as the linear primer (denoted as an aptaprimer) to initiate RCA. In the absence of a protein target, the aptaprimer is free to initiate RCA, which can produce long DNA products that are detected via binding of a fluorescent intercalating dye. Introduction of a target causes the primer region within the aptamer to become unavailable for binding to the circular template, inhibiting RCA. Using SYBR Gold or QuantiFluor dyes as fluorescent probes to bind to the RCA reaction product, it is possible to produce a generic protein&#8208;modulated RCA assay system that does not require fluorophore&#8208; or biotin&#8208;modified DNA species, substantially reducing complexity and cost of reagents. Based on this modulation of RCA, we demonstrate the ability to produce both solution and paper&#8208;based assays for rapid and quantitative detection of proteins including platelet derived growth factor and thrombin.

      <title>A Gold(I) Complex Containing an Oleanolic Acid Derivative as a Potential Anti&#8208;Ovarian&#8208;Cancer Agent by Inhibiting TrxR and Activating ROS&#8208;Mediated ERS
</title>
      <dc:description>
Au versus OC: A gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer (OC) cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzyme activity to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediates ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, it inhibits xenograft OC tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.







Abstract
Many cancer cells critically rely on antioxidant systems for cell survival and are vulnerable to further oxidative impairment triggered by agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the classical design and development of inhibitors that target antioxidant defense enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) can be a promising anticancer strategy. Herein, it is shown that a gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative (4&#8201;b) induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer A2780 cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It can inhibit TrxR enzyme activity to elevate ROS, mediate ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, this complex inhibits A2780 xenograft tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.

Supramolecular gears: The solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature and pressure by a combination of non&#8208;ambient XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The structures and solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the general formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (where DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature (from 100 to 360&#8197;K) and pressure (up to 3.4&#8197;GPa), through the combination of variable&#8208;temperature and variable&#8208;pressure XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The two salts are isomorphous and crystallize in the enantiomeric space groups P3221 and P3121. All building blocks composing the supramolecular complex display dynamic processes at ambient temperature and pressure. It has been demonstrated that the motion of the crown ethers is maintained on lowering the temperature (down to 100&#8197;K) or on increasing the pressure (up to 1.5&#8197;GPa) thanks to the correlation between neighboring molecules, which mesh and rotate in a concerted manner similar to spiral gears. Above 1.55&#8197;GPa, a collapse&#8208;type transition to a lower&#8208;symmetry ordered structure, not attainable at a temperature of 100&#8197;K, takes place, proving, thus, that the pressure acts as the means to couple and decouple the gears. The relationship between temperature and pressure effects on molecular motion in the solid state has also been discussed.

      <title>Towards the Sarpagine&#8208;Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Family of Indole Alkaloids: Enantioselective Synthesis of an N&#8208;Demethyl Alstolactone Diastereomer</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic methods: Transannular cyclization is a key step for the formation of azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a common structural motif found in the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of natural products (see scheme).







Abstract
the strategy involving the use of functionalized tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;cycloocta[b]indol&#8208;6&#8208;one is reported as a key intermediate for synthesis of members of the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The desired tricycle was synthesized through the following key steps: 1)&#8197;Evans&#8217; syn&#8208;selective aldolization; 2)&#8197;Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl cross&#8208;coupling using the phenylthiol ester of 3&#8208;chloropropanoic acid as a surrogate of acrylic thioester for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles; and 3)&#8197;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) for the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring. An N&#8208;allylation followed by intramolecular 1,4&#8208;addition was planned for synthesis of the vobasine class of natural products. However, attempted cyclizations under a diverse set of conditions involving anionic, radical, and organopalladium/organonickel species failed to produce the bridged ring system. On the other hand, esterification of the pendant primary alcohol function with acetoacetic acid, followed by intramolecular Michael addition, afforded the desired tetracycle with excellent diastereoselectivity. Subsequent functional group manipulation and transannular cyclization of the amino alcohol afforded the N(1)&#8208;demethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;alstolactone. We believe that the same synthetic route would afford the alstolactone should the amino alcohol with appropriate stereochemistry be used as the starting material.

&lt;p&gt;the strategy involving the use of functionalized tetrahydro&#8208;6&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cycloocta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indol&#8208;6&#8208;one is reported as a key intermediate for synthesis of members of the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The desired tricycle was synthesized through the following key steps: 1)&#8197;Evans&#8217; &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;selective aldolization; 2)&#8197;Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl cross&#8208;coupling using the phenylthiol ester of 3&#8208;chloropropanoic acid as a surrogate of acrylic thioester for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles; and 3)&#8197;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) for the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring. An &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allylation followed by intramolecular 1,4&#8208;addition was planned for synthesis of the vobasine class of natural products. However, attempted cyclizations under a diverse set of conditions involving anionic, radical, and organopalladium/organonickel species failed to produce the bridged ring system. On the other hand, esterification of the pendant primary alcohol function with acetoacetic acid, followed by intramolecular Michael addition, afforded the desired tetracycle with excellent diastereoselectivity. Subsequent functional group manipulation and transannular cyclization of the amino alcohol afforded the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;(1)&#8208;demethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;alstolactone. We believe that the same synthetic route would afford the alstolactone should the amino alcohol with appropriate stereochemistry be used as the starting material.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Defluoroalkylation of sp3 C&#8722;F Bonds of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it simple! A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones (see scheme).







Abstract
A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones. The reaction sequence allows construction of a new C&#8722;C bond in a highly selective manner from a single sp3 C&#8722;F bond of a CF3 group in the presence of sp2 C&#8722;F bonds. The scope incorporates industrially relevant fluorocarbons including HFO&#8208;1234yf and HFO&#8208;1234ze. No catalyst, additives or transition metals are required, rather the methodology relies on a recently developed boron reagent. Remarkably, the boron site of this reagent plays a dual role in the reaction sequence, being nucleophilic at boron in the C&#8722;F cleavage step (SN2&#8217;) but electrophilic at boron en route to the carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming step (SE2&#8217;). The duplicitous behaviour is underpinned by a hydrogen atom migration from boron to the carbon atom of a carbene ligand.

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the barrel: The formation of H&#8208;aggregates for an 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI)&#8208;containing organogelator enhances the fluorescence quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, a new record for HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system.







Abstract
To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI), in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f=2.9 vs. 0.02&#8201;%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Structural Elucidation of Silver(I) Amides and Their Application as Catalysts in the Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Carbonyls</title>
      <dc:description>
The allure of silver: Utilizing monomeric silver(I) amides as molecular defined pre&#8208;catalysts, the first silver&#8208;mediated hydroboration of a range of aldehydes and ketones has been achieved. Catalytic hydrosilylation of carbonyls has also shown success employing Ph2SiH2. Both mechanisms are proposed to proceed via a &#8216;AgH&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
This study details the isolation and characterisation of three novel silver(I) amides in solution and solid&#8208;state, [Ag(Cy3P)(HMDS)] 2, [Ag(Cy3P){N(TMS)(Dipp)}] 3 and [Ag(Cy3P)2(NPh2)] 4. Their catalytic abilities have proved successful in hydroboration and hydrosilylation reactions with a full investigation performed with complex&#8197;2. Both protocols proceed under mild conditions, displaying exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance and chemoselectivity, in excellent conversions at competitive reaction times. This work reveals the first catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones performed by a silver(I) catalyst.

      <title>Highly Polarized Coumarin Derivatives Revisited: Solvent&#8208;controlled Competition Between Proton Coupled Electron Transfer and Twisted Intramolecular Electron Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Linking a polarized coumarin unit with an aromatic substituent via an amide bridge results in weak electronic coupling affecting the intramolecular electron transfer (ET) process. As a result of this, interesting solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical properties can be observed. In polar solvents, electron transfer in coumarin derivatives of this type induces a mutual twist of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting molecular units (TICT process) that opens radiationless decay processes (internal conversion). In the dyad with the strongest intramolecular hydrogen bond, the planar form is stabilized so twisting can only occur in highly polar solvents, whereas fast proton coupled electron transfer (PCET process) occurs in non&#8208;polar n&#8208;alkanes. The kPCET rate constant decreases linearly with the fluorescence maximum energy in different solvents. This observation is explained in terms of competition between electron and proton transfer from a highly polarized (~15 D) and fluorescent locally&#8208;excited (1LE) state to a much less polarized (~4 D) charge&#8208;transfer (1CT) state, a unique occurrence. Photophysical measurements performed for a family of related coumarin dyads together with results of quantum&#8208;chemical computations give insight into the mechanism of the ET process which is followed by either a TICT or PCET process.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Divergent Catalysis Using a Bench&#8208;Stable Cobalt(I) Hydride Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Night and day: A rare example of switching product outcome depending on light&#8208;dark is reported. Using a cobalt(I) hydride complex, hydroborated products are obtained under visible&#8208;light irradiation whereas, in contrast, alkene isomerisation occurs in the dark. This dual&#8208;function catalysis results from alteration of the coordination sphere surrounding the metal centre.







Abstract
While the use of visible light in conjunction with transition metal catalysis offers powerful opportunities to switch between on/&#8208;off states of catalytic activity, the next frontier would be the ability to switch the actual function of the catalyst and resulting products. Here we report such an example of multi&#8208;dimensional catalysis. Featuring an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable cobalt(I) hydride complex in conjunction with pinacolborane, we can switch the reaction outcome between two widely employed transformations, olefin migration and hydroboration, with visible light as the trigger.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of visible light in conjunction with transition metal catalysis offers powerful opportunities to switch between on/&#8208;off states of catalytic activity, the next frontier would be the ability to switch the actual function of the catalyst and resulting products. Here we report such an example of multi&#8208;dimensional catalysis. Featuring an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable cobalt(I) hydride complex in conjunction with pinacolborane, we can switch the reaction outcome between two widely employed transformations, olefin migration and hydroboration, with visible light as the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Room Temperature Coupling of Aryldiazoacetates with Boronic Acids Enhanced by Blue Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Lights on! A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Mechanistic studies including control experiments, DFT calculations and reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring; as well as synthetic applications have been performed showcasing a rich panorama of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photochemical protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Except for a few cases, the room temperature coupling in the dark (thermal process) generally does not work. When it does, it is likely to also involve free carbenes as key intermediates. Alternatively, photochemical reactions show a broad scope, can be performed under air and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups. Reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring, DFT calculations and control experiments have been used to evaluate the main aspects of this intricate mechanistic scenario. Biologically active molecules Adiphenine, Benactyzine and Aprophen have been prepared as examples of synthetic applications.

      <title>Efficient Fused Ring Extension of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type Nonfullerene Acceptors via Symmetric Replicating Core Unit Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Extension of a fused aromatic ring core is beneficial for enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer and effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation in A&#8208;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). In this work, a novel strategy involving extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetrically replicating core unit was developed, and a novel symmetric fused&#8208;12&#8208;ring NFA, LC81 was synthesized. When paired with the wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PBT1&#8208;C, the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs) showed a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.71%, much higher than that of the device based on reference NFA, TPTT&#8208;4F. Moreover, the LC81&#8208;based OSC displayed a lower energy loss and a better ambient stability than the TPTT&#8208;4F&#8208;based device. Our results indicate that the extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetric replicating core unit is an effective strategy for promoting photovoltaic characteristics of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;temperature solution crystallization of nanostructured oxides and thin films</title>
      <dc:description>The increasing demand of high&#8208;performance crystalline oxide nanomaterials for applications in current and emergent technologies is pushing research on alternative and sustainable synthesis processes, ideally complying with the principles of Green Chemistry. In this framework, wet&#8208;chemistry approaches are particularly promising, since they are typically based on soft synthesis processes, in terms of temperature and pressure, or use water and/or non&#8208;toxic alcohols as solvents. Solution methods are low&#8208;cost and simple approaches to the synthesis of nanomaterials but, to achieve sustainable, environmentally friendly and competitive manufacturing, they should address an additional target, i.e.  the reduction of process energy consumption. This is one of the paradigms of Green Chemistry, where low temperatures and mild conditions of synthesis are specifically pursued. Using low temperatures for the preparation of a nanomaterial or of a nanostructured thin film does not necessarily imply sacrificing crystallinity and compositional purity of the obtained sample. Indeed, low temperatures actually afford tighter control on size and size distribution of the obtained nanostructures and of the microstructure and heterostructure of the resulting films.

In this context, the present progress report provides a brief overview of low&#8208;temperature solution methods reported in the literature to attain crystalline oxide nanostructures and thin films.

      <title>Hydroboration of alkenes catalysed by a nickel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex: reaction and mechanistic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The pentamethylcyclopentadienyl N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel complex [Ni(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Cl(IMes)] (IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) efficiently catalyses the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes with catecholborane in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide, and joins the very exclusive club of nickel catalysts for this important transformation. Interestingly, the regioselectivity can be reversed in some cases by using pinacolborane instead of catecholborane. Mechanistic investigations involving control experiments,  1  H and  11  B NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, piezometric measurements and DFT calculations suggest an initial reduction of the Ni(II) precursor to a Ni(I) active species with the concomitant release of H  2  . The crucial role of the alkoxo&#8208;catecholato&#8208;borohydride species resulting from the reaction of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide with catecholborane in the formation of an intermediate nickel&#8208;hydride species that would then be reduced a Ni(I) active species, is highlighted.</dc:description>

Obtained products have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by computational methods. Completely regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formation of the five&#8208;membered ring system in products  3  , containing four stereogenic centers, can be explained by an unprecedented, stepwise (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of two thiochalcone molecules mediated by Fe  3  (CO)  12  . Quantum chemical calculations, aimed at elucidation of the reaction mechanism, suggest that the formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition proceeds  via  sequential intramolecular radical transfer events upon homolytic cleavage of one carbon&#8208;sulfur bond leading to a diradical intermediate.</dc:description>

Quantum chemical calculations, aimed at elucidation of the reaction mechanism, suggest that the formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition proceeds  via  sequential intramolecular radical transfer events upon homolytic cleavage of one carbon&#8208;sulfur bond leading to a diradical intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Manipulation of the Coordination Geometry along the C4 Rotation Axis in a Dinuclear Tb3+ Triple&#8208;Decker Complex via a Supramolecular Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Switchable SMMs: The magnetic relaxation behavior of a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) could be controlled by selectively changing the coordination environment in the neutral state using a supramolecular approach. By controlling the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 axis in the Tb&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes, switchable SMMs are possible.







Abstract
A supramolecular complex (1&#8901;C60) was prepared by assembling (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) with the dinuclear Tb3+ triple&#8208;decker complex [(TPP)Tb(Pc)Tb(TPP)] (1: Tb3+=trivalent terbium ion, Pc2&#8722;=phthalocyaninato, TPP2&#8722;=tetraphenylporphyrinato) with quasi&#8208;D4h symmetry to investigate the relationship between the coordination symmetry and single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) properties. Tb3+&#8208;Pc triple&#8208;decker complexes (Tb2Pc3) have an important advantage over Tb3+&#8208;Pc double&#8208;decker complexes (TbPc2) since the magnetic relaxation processes correspond to the Zeeman splitting when there are two 4f spin systems. The two Tb3+ sites of 1 are equivalent, and the twist angle (&#966;) was determined to be 3.62&#176;. On the other hand, the two Tb3+ sites of 1&#8901;C60 are not equivalent. The &#966; values for sites Tb1 and Tb2 were determined to be 3.67&#176; and 33.8&#176;, respectively, due to a change in the coordination symmetry of 1 upon association with C60. At 1.8&#8197;K, 1 and 1&#8901;C60 undergo different magnetic relaxations, and the changes in the ground state affect the spin dynamics. Although 1 and 1&#8901;C60 relax via QTM in a zero applied magnetic field (H), H dependencies of the magnetic relaxation times (&#964;) for H&gt;1500&#8197;Oe are similar. On the other hand, for H&lt;1500&#8197;Oe, the &#964; values have different behaviors since the off&#8208;diagonal terms (
) affect the magnetic relaxation mechanism. From temperature (T) and H dependences of &#964;, spin&#8208;phonon interactions along with direct and Raman mechanisms explain the spin dynamics. We believe that a supramolecular method can be used to control the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 rotation axis and the spin dynamic properties in dinuclear Ln3+&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes.

      <title>Boosting visible&#8208;light photocatalytic redox reaction by charge separation in SnO2/ZnSe(N2H4)0.5 heterojunction nanocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report environmental photocatalysts with attractive catalytic properties prepared by introducing SnO  2  quantum dots (QDs) directly attached onto ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  substrates to induce advantageous charge separation. The SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  nanocomposites could be easily synthesized  via  a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal process. Owing to the absence of capping ligands, the attached SnO  2  QDs displayed superior photocatalytic properties, generating many exposed reactive surfaces. Moreover, the addition of a specified amount of SnO  2  boosted the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity; however, the presence of excess SnO  2  QDs in the substrate resulted in aggregation and deteriorated the performance. The spectroscopic data revealed that the SnO  2  QDs act as a photocatalytic mediator and enhance the charge separation within the type&#8208;II band alignment system of the SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  heterojunction photocatalysts. The separated charges in the heterojunction nanocomposites promote radical generation and react with pollutants, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Collective Effects of Electron Affinity and Steric Hindrance of Trifluoromethyl on the &#960;&#8208;Bridge in Designing Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>To explore the correlation of the electron affinity of acceptor and the molecular conformation to the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) feature, a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules were designed and synthesized with triazine (Trz) as acceptor (A) and carbazole (Cz) or tert&#8208;butylcarbazole (BuCz) as donor (D).

Both the twist angles and the singlet and triplet energy difference (&#916;  E  ST  ) were observed strongly dependent on the type and position of the substituent on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. Only those molecules with trifluoromethyl locating close to the D side, namely TrzCz&#8208;CF  3  and TrzBuCz&#8208;CF  3  , exhibit TADF feature, verifying that both sufficient electron affinity of the A unit and large dihedral angle between D and the &#960;&#8208;bridge are necessary to ensure the occurance of TADF.

      <dc:description>
Unusual spin&#8208;crossover features of [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]+: The series of compounds [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=a halogen substituent) exhibit 50&#8201;% spin crossover with a broad [HS&#8208;LS] plateau, a magnetic profile hitherto not crystallographically elucidated within the FeIII&#8208;salRen family (R=alkyl group). As its solvated BPh4&#8722; salt, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]+ is LS and undergoes a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray structures of the halo&#8208;substituted complexes [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) [salMeen=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)salicylaldiminate]at RT have revealed the presence of two discrete HS complex cations in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with two perchlorate counter ions linking them by N&#8722;Hamine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Operchlorate interactions. At 90&#8197;K, the two complex cations are distinctly HS and LS, a rare crystallographic observation of this coexistence in the FeIII&#8208;salRen (R=alkyl) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) system. At both temperatures, crystal packing shows dimerization through C&#8722;Himine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ophenolate interactions, a key feature for SCO cooperativity. Moreover, there are noncovalent contacts between the complex cations through type&#8208;II halogen&#8208;halogen bonds, which are novel in this system. The magnetic profiles and M&#246;ssbauer spectra concur with the structural analyses and reveal 50&#8201;% SCO of the type [HS&#8208;HS]&#8596;[HS&#8208;LS] with a broad plateau. In contrast, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]BPh4&#8901;2MeOH is LS and exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition, exemplifying the influence of lattice solvents and counter ions on SCO.

At 90&#8197;K, the two complex cations are distinctly HS and LS, a rare crystallographic observation of this coexistence in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;salRen (R=alkyl) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) system. At both temperatures, crystal packing shows dimerization through C&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;imine&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;phenolate&lt;/sub&gt; interactions, a key feature for SCO cooperativity. Moreover, there are noncovalent contacts between the complex cations through type&#8208;II halogen&#8208;halogen bonds, which are novel in this system. The magnetic profiles and M&#246;ssbauer spectra concur with the structural analyses and reveal 50&#8201;% SCO of the type [HS&#8208;HS]&#8596;[HS&#8208;LS] with a broad plateau.

      <dc:description>
An unsubstituted CpRhIII complex is a highly effective catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral benzamides (see scheme).







Abstract
It has been established that an unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRhIII) complex is a highly active catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of sterically demanding ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. This catalysis was successfully applied to the diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamides. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamide derivatives with high ee values.

      <title>ZnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed [4+1] Annulation of Alkylthio&#8208;Substituted Enaminones and Enaminothiones with Sulfur Ylides</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid catalyzed protocol has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted furan and thiophene derivatives from enaminones and enaminothiones. The [4+1] annulation allows for broad substrate scopes, high efficiency, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.







Abstract
Concise construction of furan and thiophene units has played an important role in the synthesis of potentially bioactive compounds and functional materials. Herein, an efficient Lewis acid ZnCl2 catalyzed [4+1] annulation of alkylthio&#8208;substituted enaminones is reported, that is, &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals with sulfur ylides to afford 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;aminofuran derivatives. In a similar fashion, [4+1] annulation of the corresponding enaminothiones, that is, &#945;&#8208;thioxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals, with sulfur ylides efficiently proceeded to give multisubstituted 3&#8208;aminothiophenes. This method features wide substrate scopes as well as broad functional group tolerance, offering a concise route to highly functionalized furans and thiophenes.

      <title>Molecular Engineering of Isomeric Benzofurocarbazole Donors for Photophysical Management of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning delayed fluorescence: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.







Abstract
Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, only 5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (34BFCz) has been reported and, to the best of our knowledge, no other benzofurocarbazole derivatives have been covered in the literature. In the present study, two further benzofurocarbazole moieties, 12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (12BFCz) and 7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (23BFCz), have been synthesized to investigate the effect of the donor structure on the photophysics and device parameters of TADF emitters. Two benzofurocarbazole&#8208;derived TADF emitters, 12&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (o12BFCzTrz) and 7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (o23BFCzTrz), have been compared with 5&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (oBFCzTrz). The benzofurocarbazole donor structure governs the TADF characteristics, such as charge&#8208;transfer property and emission color. The 12BFCz donor has proved to be effective in blue&#8208;shifting the emission color, and 34BFCz has proven useful for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The 12BFCz&#8208;derived o12BFCzTrz showed blue&#8208;shifted color coordinates of (0.159, 0.288), compared to (0.178, 0388) for o23BFCzTrz and (0.169, 0.341) for oBFCzTrz. The 34BFCz&#8208;derived oBFCzTrz exhibited an EQE of 22.9&#8201;%, compared to 19.2&#8201;% for o12BFCzTrz and 21.1&#8201;% for o23BFCzTrz.

Abstract
In pursuit of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities, porous LiFe0.4Mn0.6PO4/CNF free&#8208;standing electrodes have been successfully prepared through a facile ionic liquid (IL) assisted electrospinning method. Owing to the hierarchical porosity and N&#8208;doped carbon layer derived from the ionic liquid, the resulting electrodes exhibited superior electrochemical performances with an improvement of conductivity and pseudocapacitive contribution, delivering a discharge capability of 162.7, 133.5, 114.5, and 102.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current rates of 0.1, 1, 5, and 10&#8197;C, respectively. It is highly expected that this facile IL&#8208;assisted electrospinning method will lead to further developments for other phosphate&#8208;based free&#8208;standing electrodes, which offers a new route in designing polyanionic cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities, porous LiFe&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CNF free&#8208;standing electrodes have been successfully prepared through a facile ionic liquid (IL) assisted electrospinning method. Owing to the hierarchical porosity and N&#8208;doped carbon layer derived from the ionic liquid, the resulting electrodes exhibited superior electrochemical performances with an improvement of conductivity and pseudocapacitive contribution, delivering a discharge capability of 162.7, 133.5, 114.5, and 102.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the current rates of 0.1, 1, 5, and 10&#8197;C, respectively. It is highly expected that this facile IL&#8208;assisted electrospinning method will lead to further developments for other phosphate&#8208;based free&#8208;standing electrodes, which offers a new route in designing polyanionic cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metallacarboranes as Photoredox Catalysts in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst and photosensitizer: Cobaltabisdicarbollide [3,3&#8217;&#8208;Co(1,2&#8208;C2B9H11)2]&#8722; and its chloro derivatives are both efficient catalysts and photosensitizers for the photooxidation of alcohols in water through single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. This behavior is due to their high solubility in water, lack of photoluminescence, easy modification of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and high oxidizing power for the Co4+/3+ couple, among others. High performance is achieved with a catalyst loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metallacarboranes with the shape of the Greek letter &#952;, such as [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;, were tested, for the first time, as efficient photoredox catalysts in the oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols in water. Their efficiency is linked to their high solubility in water, their high oxidizing power (Co4+/3+), and their absence of fluorescence on excitation, among others. In most of the studied examples, using a catalyst load of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;% gave high yields of 90&#8211;95&#8201;% with selectivity greater than 99&#8201;%. By reducing the catalyst load to 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, quantitative conversion of reactants to products was achieved, in some cases with greater than 99&#8201;% yield, high catalyst efficiency reaching a turnover number of 10&#8201;000, and a higher yield with a 45 times lower concentration of catalyst. The metallacarboranes can be recovered easily by precipitation on addition of [NMe4]Cl. A pathway for the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of alcohols is proposed.

      <title>Evidence for Genuine Bimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Activation of Dihydrogen with Gold(I)/Platinum(0) Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Balance of power: A family of AuI/Pt0 systems activate H2 by a genuine frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, as demonstrated by a joint experimental/computational effort. These studies evinced that balancing the degree of frustration versus M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction has a strong impact on activation capacity, whereas subtle modifications on ligand sterics result in drastic changes in activity and product distribution.







Abstract
A joint experimental/computational effort to elucidate the mechanism of dihydrogen activation by a gold(I)/platinum(0) metal&#8208;only frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) is described herein. The drastic effects on H2 activation derived from subtle ligand modifications have also been investigated. The importance of the balance between bimetallic adduct formation and complete frustration has been interrogated, providing for the first time evidence for genuine metal&#8208;only FLP reactivity in solution. The origin of a strong inverse kinetic isotopic effect has also been clarified, offering further support for the proposed bimetallic FLP&#8208;type cleavage of dihydrogen.

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in radical reactions involving main&#8208;group metal complexes.

Transformations that used to be the domain of late transition&#8208;metal compounds have been realized, and unusual selectivities, high activities, as well as remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerances have been reported. Recent findings demonstrate the potential of main&#8208;group metal compounds to become standard tools of synthetic chemistry, catalysis, and materials science, when operating through radical pathways.

Nanographene doping: The preparation of borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported.

Abstract
In this work, a comprehensive account of the authors&#8217; synthetic efforts to prepare borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines, bearing an ortho fluoride leaving group on each of the N&#8208; and B&#8208;aryl rings, was shown to lead to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation, giving higher yields of borazinocoronenes than those obtained with borazine precursors bearing fluoride leaving groups at the ortho positions of the B&#8208;aryl substituents. By using this pathway, an unprecedented boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery could be isolated, and its structure proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Mechanistic studies on the stepwise Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization suggest that the mechanism of the planarization reaction proceeds through extension of the &#960; system. To appraise the doping effect of the boroxadizine unit on the optoelectronic properties of topology&#8208;equivalent molecular graphenes, the all&#8208;carbon and pyrylium PAH analogues, all featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery, were also prepared. As already shown for the borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronene, the replacement of the central benzene ring by its B3N2O congener widens the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and dramatically enhances the fluorescence quantum yield.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Substitution of Aliphatic Alcohols Mediated by Sulfuryl Fluoride</title>
      <dc:description>
A method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is described. This new process is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using N, S, O, and C nucleophiles. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable, which was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification (see scheme).







Abstract
The Mitsunobu reaction is a powerful transformation for the one&#8208;pot activation and substitution of aliphatic alcohols. Significant efforts have focused on modifying the classic conditions to overcome problems associated with purification from phosphine&#8208;based byproducts. Herein, we report a phosphine free method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride. This new method is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using phthalimide, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;iminodicarboxylate, and aromatic thiol nucleophiles in 74&#8201;% average yield. Activated carbon nucleophiles and a deactivated phenol were also effective for this reaction in good yields. Secondary alcohols were also successful substrates using aryl thiols, affording the corresponding sulfides in 56&#8201;% average yield with enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable. This feature was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions enabled further in situ derivatization for the one&#8208;pot conversion of alcohols to amines or sulfones. This method also provides a boarder nucleophile scope compared to existing phosphine&#8208;free methods.

This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable, which was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mitsunobu reaction is a powerful transformation for the one&#8208;pot activation and substitution of aliphatic alcohols. Significant efforts have focused on modifying the classic conditions to overcome problems associated with purification from phosphine&#8208;based byproducts. Herein, we report a phosphine free method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride. This new method is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using phthalimide, di&#8208;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl&#8208;iminodicarboxylate, and aromatic thiol nucleophiles in 74&#8201;% average yield. Activated carbon nucleophiles and a deactivated phenol were also effective for this reaction in good yields. Secondary alcohols were also successful substrates using aryl thiols, affording the corresponding sulfides in 56&#8201;% average yield with enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable. This feature was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions enabled further in situ derivatization for the one&#8208;pot conversion of alcohols to amines or sulfones. This method also provides a boarder nucleophile scope compared to existing phosphine&#8208;free methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Efficient Screening for Ternary Molecular Ionic Cocrystals Using a Complementary Mechanosynthesis and Computational Structure Prediction Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot on predictions! The mechanosynthesis of ternary molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) with significantly different physicochemical properties has been achieved in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding. The crystal structures of the ICCs were successfully predicted by using computational methods. The results pave the way for the efficient screening of higher&#8208;order multicomponent crystal forms with functional properties (see figure).







Abstract
The discovery of molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) widens the opportunities for optimizing the physicochemical properties of APIs whilst facilitating the delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. However, ICCs are often observed serendipitously in crystallization screens and the factors dictating their crystallization are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that mechanochemical ball milling is a versatile technique for the reproducible synthesis of ternary molecular ICCs in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding with or without solvent. Computational crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations have been performed on ternary molecular ICCs for the first time and the observed crystal structures of all the ICCs were correctly predicted. Periodic dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that all the ICCs are thermodynamically stable (mean stabilization energy=&#8722;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) relative to the crystallization of a physical mixture of the binary salt and acid. The results suggest that a combined mechanosynthesis and CSP approach could be used to target the synthesis of higher&#8208;order molecular ICCs with functional properties.

      <title>Catalytic Platinum Nanoparticles Decorated with Subnanometer Molybdenum Clusters for Biomass Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
Development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals requires efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. This article demonstrates that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound.







Abstract
The development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals is hindered due to a lack of efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. Here we report that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters can efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound. In contrast with monometallic Mo catalysts that are inactive and monometallic Pt catalysts that have low activities and selectivities, bimetallic Pt&#8211;Mo catalysts exhibit synergistic effects with high activities and selectivities. The maximum activity occurs at a Pt to Mo molar ratio of three. Although Mo atoms themselves are catalytically inactive, they serve as preferential binding anchors for oxygen atoms while a catalytic transformation proceeds on neighboring surface Pt atoms. Beyond biomass processing, Pt&#8211;Mo nanoparticles are promising catalysts for a wide variety of reactions that require a transformation of molecules with an oxygen atom and, more broadly, in other fields of science and technology that require tuning of surface&#8211;oxygen interactions.

      <title>Playing with PtII and ZnII Coordination to Obtain Luminescent Metallomesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature mesomorphism was obtained for PtII and ZnII coordination complexes by playing with the coordination ability of a lipophilic gallate unit. The delicate balance between induction of mesomorphism and luminescence in condensed states is discussed (see figure).







Abstract
Blue&#8211;green luminescent terpyridine&#8208;containing PtII and ZnII complexes are reported. Equipped with lipophilic gallate units, which act as monodentate ancillary coordinating ligands and/or as anions, they display low&#8208;temperature mesomorphic properties (lamello&#8208;columnar and hexagonal mesophases for PtII and ZnII complexes, respectively). The mesomorphic properties were investigated by polarised optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X&#8208;ray scattering of bulk materials and oriented thin films. The model of self&#8208;assembly into the lamello&#8208;columnar phase of the PtII complex has been described in detail. The optical properties of the complexes were investigated in the liquid and condensed liquid crystalline states, highlighting the delicate balance between the role of the metal in determining the type of excited state responsible for the emission, and the role of the ancillary ligand in driving intermolecular interactions for proper mesophase formation.

      <title>Compressing a Non&#8208;Planar Aromatic Heterocyclic [7]Helicene to a Planar Hetero[8]Circulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting compressed: Non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core.







Abstract
This work describes a synthetic approach where a non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core. This [8]circulene consists of four benzene rings and four heterocyclic rings, and it is the first heterocyclic [8]circulene containing three different heteroatoms. The synthetic pathway proceeds via a the flattened dehydro&#8208;hetero[7]helicene, which is partially a helicene and partially a circulene: it is non&#8208;planar and helically chiral as helicenes, and contains a COT motif like [8]circulenes. The antiaromaticity of the COT core is confirmed by nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. The planarization from a helically &#960;&#8208;conjugated [7]helicene to a fully planar heterocyclic [8]circulene significantly alters the spectroscopic properties of the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalization of the [7]helicenes and the [8]circulenes by oxygenation of the thiophene rings to the corresponding thiophene&#8208;sulfones allows an almost complete fluorescence emission coverage of the visible region of the optical spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).
