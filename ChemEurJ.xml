      <title>Optically Triggered Control of the Charge Carrier Density in Chemically Functionalized Graphene Field Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Optically switchable graphene FET: Via van der Waals assembly of an approximately 1&#8197;nm thick azobenzene functionalized molecular nanosheets with single layer graphene, optically responsive field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated. The electrical carrier density of these devices can be modulated using optical stimuli, 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules. The azobenzene molecules were incorporated to the GFET channel by building a van der Waals heterostructure with a carbon nanomembrane (CNM), which is used as a molecular interposer to attach the azobenzene molecules. Under exposure with 365&#8197;nm and 455&#8197;nm light, azobenzene molecules transition between cis and trans molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment. Thus, the effective electric field acting on the GFET channel is tuned by optical stimulation and the carrier density is modulated.

      <title>BaP6N10NH:Eu2+ as a Case Study&#8211;An Imidonitridophosphate Showing Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 4&#8197;GPa and 1150&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was determined from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Doping of the title compound with Eu2+ leads to unprecedented observation of luminescence from a Eu2+&#8208;doped imidonitridophosphate.







Abstract
Barium imidonitridophosphate BaP6N10NH was synthesized at 5&#8197;GPa and 1000&#8201;&#176;C with a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique. Ba(N3)2, P3N5 and NH4Cl were used as starting materials, applying a combination of azide and mineralizer routes. The structure elucidation of BaP6N10NH (P63, a=7.5633(11), c=8.512(2)&#8197;&#197;, Z=2) was performed by a combination of transmission electron microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation. Phase purity was verified by Rietveld refinement. 1H and 31P solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy are consistent with the structure model. The chemical composition was confirmed by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and CHNS analyses. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of BaP6N10NH show blue emission upon excitation with UV to blue light (&#955;em=460&#8197;nm, fwhm=2423&#8197;cm&#8722;1) representing unprecedented Eu2+&#8208;luminescence of an imidonitride.

      <title>Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;Azaproline Creates Conformationally Adaptable Proline Derivatives for pH&#8208;Responsive Collagen Triple Helices</title>
      <dc:description>
Swings both ways: Alkylation of &#947;&#8208;azaproline creates pH&#8208;responsive amino acids that change their conformation in different chemical environments through the invertibility of nitrogen. Incorporation into collagen triple helices highlighted the conformational flexibility of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline and demonstrated its potential as a novel apparatus for the functionalization of peptides and proteins.







Abstract
C&#947;&#8208;substituted proline derivatives are valuable tools for developing functionalized collagen peptides for biological and materials investigations, yet the stereochemistry at C&#947; can produce undesired steric or stereoelectronic constraints. Alkylated &#947;&#8208;azaproline (&#947;&#8208;azPro) derivatives are proline mimetics that lack a stereogenic center at the &#947;&#8208;position of the ring and can thus utilize the invertibility of nitrogen to adapt their conformation. NMR spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations highlighted how alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro derivatives are conformationally dynamic and adopt conformational preferences through ring pucker flip along with nitrogen inversion. Lastly, incorporation of alkylated &#947;&#8208;azPro into collagen peptides produced functionalized pH&#8208;responsive triple helices with similar thermal stabilities, regardless of their placement in the Xaa or Yaa position within the characteristic Xaa&#8208;Yaa&#8208;Gly repeating unit of collagen peptides.

Abstract

      <title>A Maltol&#8208;Containing Ruthenium Polypyridyl Complex as a Potential Anticancer Agent
</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium versus platinum: The synthesis and characterisation of the potential chemotherapeutic agent [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) (DIP=4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline, mal=maltol) is described. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that the compound has higher activity than cisplatin. It is efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affects the mitochondrial metabolism.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Chemotherapy, despite its severe side effects, is to date one of the leading strategies against cancer. Metal&#8208;based drugs present several potential advantages when compared to organic compounds and they have gained trust from the scientific community after the approval on the market of the drug cisplatin. Recently, we reported the ruthenium complex ([Ru(DIP)2(sq)](PF6) (where DIP is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline and sq is semiquinonate) with a remarkable potential as chemotherapeutic agent against cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we analyse a structurally similar compound, namely [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), carrying the flavour&#8208;enhancing agent approved by the FDA, maltol (mal). To possess an FDA approved ligand is crucial for a complex, whose mechanism of action might include ligand exchange. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6), its stability in solutions and under conditions that resemble the physiological ones, and its in&#8208;depth biological investigation. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines in 2D model and on HeLa MultiCellular Tumour Spheroids (MCTS) demonstrated that our compound has higher activity than cisplatin, inspiring further tests. [Ru(DIP)2(mal)](PF6) was efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affected the mitochondrial metabolism.

Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of [Ru(DIP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(mal)](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), its stability in solutions and under conditions that resemble the physiological ones, and its in&#8208;depth biological investigation. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines in 2D model and on HeLa MultiCellular Tumour Spheroids (MCTS) demonstrated that our compound has higher activity than cisplatin, inspiring further tests. [Ru(DIP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(mal)](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) was efficiently internalised by HeLa cells through a passive transport mechanism and severely affected the mitochondrial metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structure and Bonding in a Diamond&#8208;Shaped Tin Cluster Possessing a cyclo&#8208;Sn4 Core</title>
      <dc:description>A tetrameric cluster composed entirely of (aryl)Sn units, [DMPSn]  4  (DMP = 2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl), has been prepared by reduction of [DMPSnCl]  2  with a variety of reductants.

      <dc:description>Four types of carbon dots with various color (blue, green, yellow and red) emissions have been synthesized under solvent&#8208;free condition from citric acid and different nitrogen sources (DMF, urea, ethanamide and formamide).

      <title>Yldiide Ligands as Building Blocks for Polynuclear Coinage Metal Complexes: Metal Squares, Triangles and Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Yldiides have unique electronic properties and donor abilities, but as ligands in transition metal complexes they are scarcely represented in the literature. Here, the controlled synthesis of a series of polynuclear gold yldiide complexes derived from triphenyl(cyanomethyl)phosphonium bromide, [Ph 3  PCH 2  CN]Br, under mild conditions is described. Anionic dinuclear NBu4  [(AuX) 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] (X = Cl, C 6  F 5  ) or trinuclear derivatives NBu 4  [Au 3  X 2  {C(CN)PPh 3  }] bearing terminal chloride or pentafluorophenyl groups and bridging yldiide ligands have been prepared. These compounds evolve in solution giving rise to the formation of an unprecedented tetrameric gold cluster, [Au 4  {C(CN)PPh 3  } 4  ], by the loss of the gold complex NBu 4  [AuX 2  ]. This gold cluster can also be prepared in high yield by a transmetallation reaction from the analogous tetrameric silver cluster, and two geometric isomers have been characterised, their formation dependent on the synthetic route. The  ligand has also been used to build different dinuclear and trinuclear cationic complexes bearing phosphine or diphosphine ancillary ligands and bridging yldiide moieties. Further coordination through the cyano group of the yldiide ligand gives heterometallic trinuclear or pentanuclear derivatives. Structural characterisation of many of these compounds reveals the presence of complex molecular systems stabilised by gold&#183;&#183;&#183;gold interactions and bridging yldiide ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly methyl methacrylate&#8208;assisted exfoliation of graphite and its use in acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites</title>
      <dc:description>One of the applications of graphene in which its scalable production is of utmost importance is the development of polymer composites. Among the techniques used to produce graphene flakes, the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite stands out due to its versatility and scalability. However, the solvents suitable for the LPE process are generally toxic and have a high boiling point, making the processing challenging. The use of low boiling point solvents could be convenient for the processing, due to the easiness of their removal.
In this study, we propose the use of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a stabilizing agent for the production of graphene flakes in a low boiling point solvent,  i.e.,  acetone. The graphene dispersions produced in the mixture acetone&#8208;PMMA increases the concentration by +175&#160;%, and contain a higher percentage of few&#8209;layer graphene flakes (&lt;&#160;5&#160;layers)  , e.g.,  +60&#160;%, compared to the dispersions prepared in acetone. The as&#8208;produced graphene dispersions are used to develop graphene/acrylonitrile&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene composites. The mechanical properties of the pristine polymer are improved,  i.e  ., +&#160;22&#160;% in the Young&#8217;s modulus, by adding 0.01&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes. Moreover, a decrease of ~&#160;20&#160;% in the oxygen permeability is obtained using 0.1&#160;wt.&#160;% of graphene flakes filler, compared to the unloaded matrix.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing relaxation dynamics in five&#8208;coordinate dysprosium single&#8208;molecule magnets</title>
      <dc:description>We report a new family of five&#8208;coordinate Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets (Ln SMMs) [Dy(Mes*O) 2 (THF) 2 X] (Mes*= 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl; X = Cl, 1 ; Br, 2 ; I, 3 ) with energy barriers to magnetic reversal amongst the highest reported for any SMM to date. The five&#8208;coordinate Dy(III) ions have distorted square pyramidal geometries, with halide anions on the apex, and two Mes*O ligands mutually trans&#8208; to each other, and the two THF molecules forming the second trans&#8208; pair. These geometrical features lead to a large magnetic anisotropy in these complexes giving Orbach energy barriers above 1200 K. QTM and Raman relaxation times are significantly enhanced by varying the apex halide from Cl to Br to I, or by simple dilution in a diamagnetic yttrium analogue.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report a new family of five&#8208;coordinate Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets (Ln SMMs) [Dy(Mes*O) 2 (THF) 2 X] (Mes*= 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl; X = Cl, 1 ; Br, 2 ; I, 3 ) with energy barriers to magnetic reversal amongst the highest reported for any SMM to date. The five&#8208;coordinate Dy(III) ions have distorted square pyramidal geometries, with halide anions on the apex, and two Mes*O ligands mutually trans&#8208; to each other, and the two THF molecules forming the second trans&#8208; pair. These geometrical features lead to a large magnetic anisotropy in these complexes giving Orbach energy barriers above 1200 K. QTM and Raman relaxation times are significantly enhanced by varying the apex halide from Cl to Br to I, or by simple dilution in a diamagnetic yttrium analogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sulfonated Pyrene as a Photoregulator for Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Looping</title>
      <dc:description>
Loop&#8208;control system: The water&#8208;soluble sulfonated pyrene derivative SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator for the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). By observing the formation rate of the SPy dimer radical cation after photoionization, the looping kinetics of doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNA was revealed. Reducing the SPy dimer radical cation makes it possible to realize controlled unlooping.







Abstract
Controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules through photoregulators holds great promise as a spatiotemporally controllable tool for disease control. In addition, introducing photoregulators into biomolecules has also found applications in constructing smart nanomaterials. In spite of the astonishing advances that have been made in the past few years, realizing highly controllable and efficient regulation over the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions is still challenging. Herein, sulfonated pyrene SPy was synthesized and used as a photoregulator to control the looping of single&#8208;stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in aqueous solution. Due to its water solubility, SPy merits use in the study of biomolecules in aqueous solution. The looping of the doubly SPy&#8208;modified ssDNAs is stimulated by irradiation and regulated by SPy. Photoionization generates the radical cation of SPy (SPy.+). The association of SPy.+ with its neutral counterpart, SPy, gives rise to the dimer radical cation of SPy (SPy2.+). During the association process, the stabilization energy released to form SPy2.+ provides a driving force for the looping of ssDNAs. Conversely, the formed loop conformations were trapped by the formation of SPy2.+, and this allowed the looping dynamics to be investigated. The results reported herein suggest potential of SPy as a photoregulator for controlling the conformation and function of biomolecules under physiological conditions.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing with an Aptamer&#8208;Containing DNA Primer</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosensors: We demonstrate the ability to detect protein targets in solution and on paper&#8208;based sensors using a target&#8208;binding aptamer as a primer for rolling circle amplification (RCA). Binding of the target protein to the aptamer prevents the aptamer from binding a circular templet, inhibiting the initiation of the RCA process, which can be followed using a simple fluorescence assay (see figure).







Abstract
We report a method to detect proteins via suppression of rolling circle amplification (RCA) by using an appropriate aptamer as the linear primer (denoted as an aptaprimer) to initiate RCA. In the absence of a protein target, the aptaprimer is free to initiate RCA, which can produce long DNA products that are detected via binding of a fluorescent intercalating dye. Introduction of a target causes the primer region within the aptamer to become unavailable for binding to the circular template, inhibiting RCA. Using SYBR Gold or QuantiFluor dyes as fluorescent probes to bind to the RCA reaction product, it is possible to produce a generic protein&#8208;modulated RCA assay system that does not require fluorophore&#8208; or biotin&#8208;modified DNA species, substantially reducing complexity and cost of reagents. Based on this modulation of RCA, we demonstrate the ability to produce both solution and paper&#8208;based assays for rapid and quantitative detection of proteins including platelet derived growth factor and thrombin.

      <title>A Gold(I) Complex Containing an Oleanolic Acid Derivative as a Potential Anti&#8208;Ovarian&#8208;Cancer Agent by Inhibiting TrxR and Activating ROS&#8208;Mediated ERS
</title>
      <dc:description>
Au versus OC: A gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer (OC) cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzyme activity to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediates ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, it inhibits xenograft OC tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.







Abstract
Many cancer cells critically rely on antioxidant systems for cell survival and are vulnerable to further oxidative impairment triggered by agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the classical design and development of inhibitors that target antioxidant defense enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) can be a promising anticancer strategy. Herein, it is shown that a gold(I) complex containing an oleanolic acid derivative (4&#8201;b) induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer A2780 cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). It can inhibit TrxR enzyme activity to elevate ROS, mediate ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of A2780 cells. Notably, this complex inhibits A2780 xenograft tumor growth accompanied by increased ERS level and decreased TrxR activity in tumor tissues.

      <title>Solid&#8208;State Dynamics and High&#8208;Pressure Studies of a Supramolecular Spiral Gear</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular gears: The solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature and pressure by a combination of non&#8208;ambient XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The structures and solid&#8208;state dynamics of the supramolecular salts of the general formula [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2&#8901;DABCOH2](X)2 (where DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, X=BF4, ClO4) have been investigated as a function of temperature (from 100 to 360&#8197;K) and pressure (up to 3.4&#8197;GPa), through the combination of variable&#8208;temperature and variable&#8208;pressure XRD techniques and variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The two salts are isomorphous and crystallize in the enantiomeric space groups P3221 and P3121. All building blocks composing the supramolecular complex display dynamic processes at ambient temperature and pressure. It has been demonstrated that the motion of the crown ethers is maintained on lowering the temperature (down to 100&#8197;K) or on increasing the pressure (up to 1.5&#8197;GPa) thanks to the correlation between neighboring molecules, which mesh and rotate in a concerted manner similar to spiral gears. Above 1.55&#8197;GPa, a collapse&#8208;type transition to a lower&#8208;symmetry ordered structure, not attainable at a temperature of 100&#8197;K, takes place, proving, thus, that the pressure acts as the means to couple and decouple the gears. The relationship between temperature and pressure effects on molecular motion in the solid state has also been discussed.

      <title>Towards the Sarpagine&#8208;Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Family of Indole Alkaloids: Enantioselective Synthesis of an N&#8208;Demethyl Alstolactone Diastereomer</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic methods: Transannular cyclization is a key step for the formation of azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a common structural motif found in the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of natural products (see scheme).







Abstract
the strategy involving the use of functionalized tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;cycloocta[b]indol&#8208;6&#8208;one is reported as a key intermediate for synthesis of members of the sarpagine&#8208;ajmaline&#8208;macroline family of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The desired tricycle was synthesized through the following key steps: 1)&#8197;Evans&#8217; syn&#8208;selective aldolization; 2)&#8197;Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl cross&#8208;coupling using the phenylthiol ester of 3&#8208;chloropropanoic acid as a surrogate of acrylic thioester for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles; and 3)&#8197;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) for the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring. An N&#8208;allylation followed by intramolecular 1,4&#8208;addition was planned for synthesis of the vobasine class of natural products. However, attempted cyclizations under a diverse set of conditions involving anionic, radical, and organopalladium/organonickel species failed to produce the bridged ring system. On the other hand, esterification of the pendant primary alcohol function with acetoacetic acid, followed by intramolecular Michael addition, afforded the desired tetracycle with excellent diastereoselectivity. Subsequent functional group manipulation and transannular cyclization of the amino alcohol afforded the N(1)&#8208;demethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;alstolactone. We believe that the same synthetic route would afford the alstolactone should the amino alcohol with appropriate stereochemistry be used as the starting material.

      <title>Defluoroalkylation of sp3 C&#8722;F Bonds of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it simple! A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones (see scheme).







Abstract
A simple, one&#8208;pot procedure is reported for the selective defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkene derivatives with aldehydes and ketones. The reaction sequence allows construction of a new C&#8722;C bond in a highly selective manner from a single sp3 C&#8722;F bond of a CF3 group in the presence of sp2 C&#8722;F bonds. The scope incorporates industrially relevant fluorocarbons including HFO&#8208;1234yf and HFO&#8208;1234ze. No catalyst, additives or transition metals are required, rather the methodology relies on a recently developed boron reagent. Remarkably, the boron site of this reagent plays a dual role in the reaction sequence, being nucleophilic at boron in the C&#8722;F cleavage step (SN2&#8217;) but electrophilic at boron en route to the carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming step (SE2&#8217;). The duplicitous behaviour is underpinned by a hydrogen atom migration from boron to the carbon atom of a carbene ligand.

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the barrel: The formation of H&#8208;aggregates for an 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI)&#8208;containing organogelator enhances the fluorescence quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude, a new record for HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system.







Abstract
To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene&#8208;dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI), in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f=2.9 vs. 0.02&#8201;%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.

The allure of silver: Utilizing monomeric silver(I) amides as molecular defined pre&#8208;catalysts, the first silver&#8208;mediated hydroboration of a range of aldehydes and ketones has been achieved. Catalytic hydrosilylation of carbonyls has also shown success employing Ph2SiH2. Both mechanisms are proposed to proceed via a &#8216;AgH&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
This study details the isolation and characterisation of three novel silver(I) amides in solution and solid&#8208;state, [Ag(Cy3P)(HMDS)] 2, [Ag(Cy3P){N(TMS)(Dipp)}] 3 and [Ag(Cy3P)2(NPh2)] 4. Their catalytic abilities have proved successful in hydroboration and hydrosilylation reactions with a full investigation performed with complex&#8197;2. Both protocols proceed under mild conditions, displaying exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance and chemoselectivity, in excellent conversions at competitive reaction times. This work reveals the first catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones performed by a silver(I) catalyst.

      <title>Highly Polarized Coumarin Derivatives Revisited: Solvent&#8208;controlled Competition Between Proton Coupled Electron Transfer and Twisted Intramolecular Electron Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Linking a polarized coumarin unit with an aromatic substituent via an amide bridge results in weak electronic coupling affecting the intramolecular electron transfer (ET) process. As a result of this, interesting solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical properties can be observed. In polar solvents, electron transfer in coumarin derivatives of this type induces a mutual twist of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting molecular units (TICT process) that opens radiationless decay processes (internal conversion). In the dyad with the strongest intramolecular hydrogen bond, the planar form is stabilized so twisting can only occur in highly polar solvents, whereas fast proton coupled electron transfer (PCET process) occurs in non&#8208;polar n&#8208;alkanes. The kPCET rate constant decreases linearly with the fluorescence maximum energy in different solvents. This observation is explained in terms of competition between electron and proton transfer from a highly polarized (~15 D) and fluorescent locally&#8208;excited (1LE) state to a much less polarized (~4 D) charge&#8208;transfer (1CT) state, a unique occurrence. Photophysical measurements performed for a family of related coumarin dyads together with results of quantum&#8208;chemical computations give insight into the mechanism of the ET process which is followed by either a TICT or PCET process. Our results reveal that dielectric solvation of the excited state slows down the PCET process, even in non&#8208;polar solvents.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Divergent Catalysis Using a Bench&#8208;Stable Cobalt(I) Hydride Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Night and day: A rare example of switching product outcome depending on light&#8208;dark is reported. Using a cobalt(I) hydride complex, hydroborated products are obtained under visible&#8208;light irradiation whereas, in contrast, alkene isomerisation occurs in the dark. This dual&#8208;function catalysis results from alteration of the coordination sphere surrounding the metal centre.







Abstract
While the use of visible light in conjunction with transition metal catalysis offers powerful opportunities to switch between on/&#8208;off states of catalytic activity, the next frontier would be the ability to switch the actual function of the catalyst and resulting products. Here we report such an example of multi&#8208;dimensional catalysis. Featuring an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable cobalt(I) hydride complex in conjunction with pinacolborane, we can switch the reaction outcome between two widely employed transformations, olefin migration and hydroboration, with visible light as the trigger.

      <title>Room Temperature Coupling of Aryldiazoacetates with Boronic Acids Enhanced by Blue Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Lights on! A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Mechanistic studies including control experiments, DFT calculations and reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring; as well as synthetic applications have been performed showcasing a rich panorama of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photochemical protocol is reported for the coupling of aryldiazoacetates with boronic acids. This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Except for a few cases, the room temperature coupling in the dark (thermal process) generally does not work. When it does, it is likely to also involve free carbenes as key intermediates. Alternatively, photochemical reactions show a broad scope, can be performed under air and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups. Reaction&#8208;evolution monitoring, DFT calculations and control experiments have been used to evaluate the main aspects of this intricate mechanistic scenario. Biologically active molecules Adiphenine, Benactyzine and Aprophen have been prepared as examples of synthetic applications.

      <title>Efficient Fused Ring Extension of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type Nonfullerene Acceptors via Symmetric Replicating Core Unit Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Extension of a fused aromatic ring core is beneficial for enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer and effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation in A&#8208;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). In this work, a novel strategy involving extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetrically replicating core unit was developed, and a novel symmetric fused&#8208;12&#8208;ring NFA, LC81 was synthesized. When paired with the wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PBT1&#8208;C, the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs) showed a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.71%, much higher than that of the device based on reference NFA, TPTT&#8208;4F. Moreover, the LC81&#8208;based OSC displayed a lower energy loss and a better ambient stability than the TPTT&#8208;4F&#8208;based device. Our results indicate that the extension of fused&#8208;ring core by symmetric replicating core unit is an effective strategy for promoting photovoltaic characteristics of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydroboration of alkenes catalysed by a nickel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex: reaction and mechanistic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The pentamethylcyclopentadienyl N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel complex [Ni(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Cl(IMes)] (IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) efficiently catalyses the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes with catecholborane in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide, and joins the very exclusive club of nickel catalysts for this important transformation. Interestingly, the regioselectivity can be reversed in some cases by using pinacolborane instead of catecholborane. Mechanistic investigations involving control experiments,  1  H and  11  B NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, piezometric measurements and DFT calculations suggest an initial reduction of the Ni(II) precursor to a Ni(I) active species with the concomitant release of H  2  . The crucial role of the alkoxo&#8208;catecholato&#8208;borohydride species resulting from the reaction of potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide with catecholborane in the formation of an intermediate nickel&#8208;hydride species that would then be reduced a Ni(I) active species, is highlighted.</dc:description>

      <title>Manipulation of the Coordination Geometry along the C4 Rotation Axis in a Dinuclear Tb3+ Triple&#8208;Decker Complex via a Supramolecular Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Switchable SMMs: The magnetic relaxation behavior of a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) could be controlled by selectively changing the coordination environment in the neutral state using a supramolecular approach. By controlling the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 axis in the Tb&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes, switchable SMMs are possible.







Abstract
A supramolecular complex (1&#8901;C60) was prepared by assembling (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) with the dinuclear Tb3+ triple&#8208;decker complex [(TPP)Tb(Pc)Tb(TPP)] (1: Tb3+=trivalent terbium ion, Pc2&#8722;=phthalocyaninato, TPP2&#8722;=tetraphenylporphyrinato) with quasi&#8208;D4h symmetry to investigate the relationship between the coordination symmetry and single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) properties. Tb3+&#8208;Pc triple&#8208;decker complexes (Tb2Pc3) have an important advantage over Tb3+&#8208;Pc double&#8208;decker complexes (TbPc2) since the magnetic relaxation processes correspond to the Zeeman splitting when there are two 4f spin systems. The two Tb3+ sites of 1 are equivalent, and the twist angle (&#966;) was determined to be 3.62&#176;. On the other hand, the two Tb3+ sites of 1&#8901;C60 are not equivalent. The &#966; values for sites Tb1 and Tb2 were determined to be 3.67&#176; and 33.8&#176;, respectively, due to a change in the coordination symmetry of 1 upon association with C60. At 1.8&#8197;K, 1 and 1&#8901;C60 undergo different magnetic relaxations, and the changes in the ground state affect the spin dynamics. Although 1 and 1&#8901;C60 relax via QTM in a zero applied magnetic field (H), H dependencies of the magnetic relaxation times (&#964;) for H&gt;1500&#8197;Oe are similar. On the other hand, for H&lt;1500&#8197;Oe, the &#964; values have different behaviors since the off&#8208;diagonal terms (
) affect the magnetic relaxation mechanism. From temperature (T) and H dependences of &#964;, spin&#8208;phonon interactions along with direct and Raman mechanisms explain the spin dynamics. We believe that a supramolecular method can be used to control the magnetic anisotropy along the C4 rotation axis and the spin dynamic properties in dinuclear Ln3+&#8208;Pc multiple&#8208;decker complexes.

      <title>Boosting visible&#8208;light photocatalytic redox reaction by charge separation in SnO2/ZnSe(N2H4)0.5 heterojunction nanocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report environmental photocatalysts with attractive catalytic properties prepared by introducing SnO  2  quantum dots (QDs) directly attached onto ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  substrates to induce advantageous charge separation. The SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  nanocomposites could be easily synthesized  via  a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal process. Owing to the absence of capping ligands, the attached SnO  2  QDs displayed superior photocatalytic properties, generating many exposed reactive surfaces. Moreover, the addition of a specified amount of SnO  2  boosted the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity; however, the presence of excess SnO  2  QDs in the substrate resulted in aggregation and deteriorated the performance. The spectroscopic data revealed that the SnO  2  QDs act as a photocatalytic mediator and enhance the charge separation within the type&#8208;II band alignment system of the SnO  2  /ZnSe(N  2  H  4  )  0.5  heterojunction photocatalysts.

      <title>Collective Effects of Electron Affinity and Steric Hindrance of Trifluoromethyl on the &#960;&#8208;Bridge in Designing Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

      <title>The CH&#8208;&#960; interaction in protein &#8211; carbohydrate binding: Bioinformatics and in vitro quantification</title>
      <dc:description>The molecular recognition of carbohydrates by proteins plays a key role in many biological processes including immune response, pathogen entry into a cell and cell&#8208;cell adhesion (e.g., in cancer metastasis).

Unusual spin&#8208;crossover features of [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]+: The series of compounds [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=a halogen substituent) exhibit 50&#8201;% spin crossover with a broad [HS&#8208;LS] plateau, a magnetic profile hitherto not crystallographically elucidated within the FeIII&#8208;salRen family (R=alkyl group).

Abstract
X&#8208;ray structures of the halo&#8208;substituted complexes [FeIII(5&#8208;X&#8208;salMeen)2]ClO4 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) [salMeen=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)salicylaldiminate]at RT have revealed the presence of two discrete HS complex cations in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with two perchlorate counter ions linking them by N&#8722;Hamine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Operchlorate interactions. At 90&#8197;K, the two complex cations are distinctly HS and LS, a rare crystallographic observation of this coexistence in the FeIII&#8208;salRen (R=alkyl) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) system. At both temperatures, crystal packing shows dimerization through C&#8722;Himine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ophenolate interactions, a key feature for SCO cooperativity. Moreover, there are noncovalent contacts between the complex cations through type&#8208;II halogen&#8208;halogen bonds, which are novel in this system. The magnetic profiles and M&#246;ssbauer spectra concur with the structural analyses and reveal 50&#8201;% SCO of the type [HS&#8208;HS]&#8596;[HS&#8208;LS] with a broad plateau. In contrast, [FeIII(5&#8208;Cl&#8208;salMeen)2]BPh4&#8901;2MeOH is LS and exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic phase transition, exemplifying the influence of lattice solvents and counter ions on SCO.

      <dc:description>
An unsubstituted CpRhIII complex is a highly effective catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral benzamides (see scheme).







Abstract
It has been established that an unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRhIII) complex is a highly active catalyst for the aerobic oxidative ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination of sterically demanding ortho&#8208;substituted benzamides with alkenes. This catalysis was successfully applied to the diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamides. The combination of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation and the CpRhIII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective ortho C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzamide derivatives with high ee values.

      <title>ZnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed [4+1] Annulation of Alkylthio&#8208;Substituted Enaminones and Enaminothiones with Sulfur Ylides</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid catalyzed protocol has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted furan and thiophene derivatives from enaminones and enaminothiones. The [4+1] annulation allows for broad substrate scopes, high efficiency, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.







Abstract
Concise construction of furan and thiophene units has played an important role in the synthesis of potentially bioactive compounds and functional materials. Herein, an efficient Lewis acid ZnCl2 catalyzed [4+1] annulation of alkylthio&#8208;substituted enaminones is reported, that is, &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals with sulfur ylides to afford 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;aminofuran derivatives. In a similar fashion, [4+1] annulation of the corresponding enaminothiones, that is, &#945;&#8208;thioxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals, with sulfur ylides efficiently proceeded to give multisubstituted 3&#8208;aminothiophenes. This method features wide substrate scopes as well as broad functional group tolerance, offering a concise route to highly functionalized furans and thiophenes.

Herein, an efficient Lewis acid ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyzed [4+1] annulation of alkylthio&#8208;substituted enaminones is reported, that is, &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals with sulfur ylides to afford 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;aminofuran derivatives. In a similar fashion, [4+1] annulation of the corresponding enaminothiones, that is, &#945;&#8208;thioxo ketene N,S&#8208;acetals, with sulfur ylides efficiently proceeded to give multisubstituted 3&#8208;aminothiophenes. This method features wide substrate scopes as well as broad functional group tolerance, offering a concise route to highly functionalized furans and thiophenes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular Engineering of Isomeric Benzofurocarbazole Donors for Photophysical Management of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning delayed fluorescence: The effects of isomeric benzofurocarbazole donor structures on the photophysical properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been investigated.







Abstract
Benzofurocarbazole moieties are commonly used donor structures in the design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, only 5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (34BFCz) has been reported and, to the best of our knowledge, no other benzofurocarbazole derivatives have been covered in the literature. In the present study, two further benzofurocarbazole moieties, 12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (12BFCz) and 7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (23BFCz), have been synthesized to investigate the effect of the donor structure on the photophysics and device parameters of TADF emitters. Two benzofurocarbazole&#8208;derived TADF emitters, 12&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;12&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;a]carbazole (o12BFCzTrz) and 7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;7&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[2,3&#8208;b]carbazole (o23BFCzTrz), have been compared with 5&#8208;(2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;5&#8201;H&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole (oBFCzTrz). The benzofurocarbazole donor structure governs the TADF characteristics, such as charge&#8208;transfer property and emission color. The 12BFCz donor has proved to be effective in blue&#8208;shifting the emission color, and 34BFCz has proven useful for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The 12BFCz&#8208;derived o12BFCzTrz showed blue&#8208;shifted color coordinates of (0.159, 0.288), compared to (0.178, 0388) for o23BFCzTrz and (0.169, 0.341) for oBFCzTrz. The 34BFCz&#8208;derived oBFCzTrz exhibited an EQE of 22.9&#8201;%, compared to 19.2&#8201;% for o12BFCzTrz and 21.1&#8201;% for o23BFCzTrz.

Abstract
In pursuit of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities, porous LiFe0.4Mn0.6PO4/CNF free&#8208;standing electrodes have been successfully prepared through a facile ionic liquid (IL) assisted electrospinning method. Owing to the hierarchical porosity and N&#8208;doped carbon layer derived from the ionic liquid, the resulting electrodes exhibited superior electrochemical performances with an improvement of conductivity and pseudocapacitive contribution, delivering a discharge capability of 162.7, 133.5, 114.5, and 102.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current rates of 0.1, 1, 5, and 10&#8197;C, respectively. It is highly expected that this facile IL&#8208;assisted electrospinning method will lead to further developments for other phosphate&#8208;based free&#8208;standing electrodes, which offers a new route in designing polyanionic cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Metallacarboranes as Photoredox Catalysts in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst and photosensitizer: Cobaltabisdicarbollide [3,3&#8217;&#8208;Co(1,2&#8208;C2B9H11)2]&#8722; and its chloro derivatives are both efficient catalysts and photosensitizers for the photooxidation of alcohols in water through single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. This behavior is due to their high solubility in water, lack of photoluminescence, easy modification of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and high oxidizing power for the Co4+/3+ couple, among others. High performance is achieved with a catalyst loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metallacarboranes with the shape of the Greek letter &#952;, such as [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;, were tested, for the first time, as efficient photoredox catalysts in the oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols in water. Their efficiency is linked to their high solubility in water, their high oxidizing power (Co4+/3+), and their absence of fluorescence on excitation, among others. In most of the studied examples, using a catalyst load of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;% gave high yields of 90&#8211;95&#8201;% with selectivity greater than 99&#8201;%. By reducing the catalyst load to 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, quantitative conversion of reactants to products was achieved, in some cases with greater than 99&#8201;% yield, high catalyst efficiency reaching a turnover number of 10&#8201;000, and a higher yield with a 45 times lower concentration of catalyst. The metallacarboranes can be recovered easily by precipitation on addition of [NMe4]Cl. A pathway for the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of alcohols is proposed.

      <title>Evidence for Genuine Bimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Activation of Dihydrogen with Gold(I)/Platinum(0) Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Balance of power: A family of AuI/Pt0 systems activate H2 by a genuine frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, as demonstrated by a joint experimental/computational effort. These studies evinced that balancing the degree of frustration versus M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction has a strong impact on activation capacity, whereas subtle modifications on ligand sterics result in drastic changes in activity and product distribution.







Abstract
A joint experimental/computational effort to elucidate the mechanism of dihydrogen activation by a gold(I)/platinum(0) metal&#8208;only frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) is described herein. The drastic effects on H2 activation derived from subtle ligand modifications have also been investigated. The importance of the balance between bimetallic adduct formation and complete frustration has been interrogated, providing for the first time evidence for genuine metal&#8208;only FLP reactivity in solution. The origin of a strong inverse kinetic isotopic effect has also been clarified, offering further support for the proposed bimetallic FLP&#8208;type cleavage of dihydrogen.

      <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal Complexes in Selective Bond Formations Through Radical Pathways</title>
      <dc:description>
Mainly main group: Remarkable progress has been made in the synthesis and investigation of main&#8208;group metal complexes for radical reactions. This contribution highlights applications of such compounds for selective bond forming events in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions through radical pathways.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in radical reactions involving main&#8208;group metal complexes.

A rich arsenal of methods has been established that allows control over and exploitation of their unusual reactivity patterns.

      <title>Boron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes: A Synthetic Tale from Borazine Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanographene doping: The preparation of borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines led to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation. A new boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery was isolated. Mechanistic studies on the reaction and evaluation of the doping effect on the optoelectronic properties are also reported.







Abstract
In this work, a comprehensive account of the authors&#8217; synthetic efforts to prepare borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronenes by using the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution is reported. Hexafluoro&#8208;functionalized aryl borazines, bearing an ortho fluoride leaving group on each of the N&#8208; and B&#8208;aryl rings, was shown to lead to cascade&#8208;type electrophilic aromatic substitution events in the stepwise C&#8722;C bond formation, giving higher yields of borazinocoronenes than those obtained with borazine precursors bearing fluoride leaving groups at the ortho positions of the B&#8208;aryl substituents. By using this pathway, an unprecedented boroxadizine&#8208;doped PAH featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery could be isolated, and its structure proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Mechanistic studies on the stepwise Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization suggest that the mechanism of the planarization reaction proceeds through extension of the &#960; system. To appraise the doping effect of the boroxadizine unit on the optoelectronic properties of topology&#8208;equivalent molecular graphenes, the all&#8208;carbon and pyrylium PAH analogues, all featuring a gulf&#8208;type periphery, were also prepared. As already shown for the borazino&#8208;doped hexabenzocoronene, the replacement of the central benzene ring by its B3N2O congener widens the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and dramatically enhances the fluorescence quantum yield.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Substitution of Aliphatic Alcohols Mediated by Sulfuryl Fluoride</title>
      <dc:description>
A method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is described. This new process is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using N, S, O, and C nucleophiles. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable, which was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification (see scheme).







Abstract
The Mitsunobu reaction is a powerful transformation for the one&#8208;pot activation and substitution of aliphatic alcohols. Significant efforts have focused on modifying the classic conditions to overcome problems associated with purification from phosphine&#8208;based byproducts. Herein, we report a phosphine free method for alcohol activation and substitution that is mediated by sulfuryl fluoride. This new method is effective for a wide range of primary alcohols using phthalimide, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;iminodicarboxylate, and aromatic thiol nucleophiles in 74&#8201;% average yield. Activated carbon nucleophiles and a deactivated phenol were also effective for this reaction in good yields. Secondary alcohols were also successful substrates using aryl thiols, affording the corresponding sulfides in 56&#8201;% average yield with enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. This new protocol has a distinct synthetic advantage over many existing phosphine&#8208;based methods as the byproducts are readily separable. This feature was exploited in several examples that did not require chromatography for purification. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions enabled further in situ derivatization for the one&#8208;pot conversion of alcohols to amines or sulfones. This method also provides a boarder nucleophile scope compared to existing phosphine&#8208;free methods.

      <title>Efficient Screening for Ternary Molecular Ionic Cocrystals Using a Complementary Mechanosynthesis and Computational Structure Prediction Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot on predictions! The mechanosynthesis of ternary molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) with significantly different physicochemical properties has been achieved in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding. The crystal structures of the ICCs were successfully predicted by using computational methods. The results pave the way for the efficient screening of higher&#8208;order multicomponent crystal forms with functional properties (see figure).







Abstract
The discovery of molecular ionic cocrystals (ICCs) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) widens the opportunities for optimizing the physicochemical properties of APIs whilst facilitating the delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. However, ICCs are often observed serendipitously in crystallization screens and the factors dictating their crystallization are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that mechanochemical ball milling is a versatile technique for the reproducible synthesis of ternary molecular ICCs in less than 30&#8197;min of grinding with or without solvent. Computational crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations have been performed on ternary molecular ICCs for the first time and the observed crystal structures of all the ICCs were correctly predicted. Periodic dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that all the ICCs are thermodynamically stable (mean stabilization energy=&#8722;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) relative to the crystallization of a physical mixture of the binary salt and acid. The results suggest that a combined mechanosynthesis and CSP approach could be used to target the synthesis of higher&#8208;order molecular ICCs with functional properties.

      <title>Catalytic Platinum Nanoparticles Decorated with Subnanometer Molybdenum Clusters for Biomass Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
Development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals requires efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. This article demonstrates that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound.







Abstract
The development of improved technologies for biomass processing into transportation fuels and industrial chemicals is hindered due to a lack of efficient catalysts for selective oxygen removal. Here we report that platinum nanoparticles decorated with subnanometer molybdenum clusters can efficiently catalyze hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, which serves as a model biomass compound. In contrast with monometallic Mo catalysts that are inactive and monometallic Pt catalysts that have low activities and selectivities, bimetallic Pt&#8211;Mo catalysts exhibit synergistic effects with high activities and selectivities. The maximum activity occurs at a Pt to Mo molar ratio of three. Although Mo atoms themselves are catalytically inactive, they serve as preferential binding anchors for oxygen atoms while a catalytic transformation proceeds on neighboring surface Pt atoms. Beyond biomass processing, Pt&#8211;Mo nanoparticles are promising catalysts for a wide variety of reactions that require a transformation of molecules with an oxygen atom and, more broadly, in other fields of science and technology that require tuning of surface&#8211;oxygen interactions.

      <title>Active Metal Template Synthesis and Characterization of a Nanohoop [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>

      <title>Extracellular matrix proteins involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and characterized by cognitive and memory impairments. Emerging evidence suggests that the extracellular matrix (ECM) biomacromolecules in brain plays an important role in etiology of AD. It has been detected that the levels of ECM proteins have been changed in the brains of AD patients and animal models. Some ECM components, e.g., elastin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are considered to promote the upregulation of extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) proteins. In addition, collagen VI and laminin are shown to have interactions with A&#946; peptides, which might lead to clearance of those peptides. Thus, ECM proteins are involved in both amyloidosis and neuroprotection in AD process. However, the molecular mechanism of neuronal ECM proteins on pathophysiology of AD remains elusive. More investigation of ECM proteins with AD pathogenesis is needed, and this may lead to novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for AD.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Diphenanthrioctaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0), an expanded carbaporphyrinoid incorporating two phenanthrenylene moieties, exists as two separate, yet interconvertible, locked stereoisomers.

      <title>Widely Electronically Tunable 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Dithieno[1,4]thia&#8208;zines &#8211; Electron&#8208;Rich Fluorophores up to Intense NIR Emission</title>
      <dc:description>2,6&#8208;Difunctionalized dithieno[1,4]thiazines were efficiently synthesized by (pseudo)five&#8208; or (pseudo)three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot processes based on lithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences. As supported by structure&#8208;property relationships, the thiophene anellation mode predominantly controls the photophysical and electrochemical properties and the electronic structures (as obtained by DFT calculations). From molecular geometries and redox potentials to fluorescence quantum yields in solution, the interaction of the dithieno[1,4]thiazine&#8208;core with the substituents causes striking differences within the series of regioisomers. Most interestingly, strong acceptors introduced in  anti  &#8208;  anti  dithieno[1,4]thiazines nearly induce a planarization of the ground&#8208;state geometry and a highly intense NIR fluorescence (  &#934;  F  = 0.52), whereas an equally substituted  syn  &#8208;  syn  dithieno[1,4]thiazine exhibits a much stronger folded molecular structure and fluoresces poorly (  &#934;  F  = 0.01). In essence, electrochemical and photophysical properties of dithieno[1,4]thiazines can be tuned widely and outscore the compared phenothiazine with cathodically shifted oxidation potentials and redshifted and more intense absorption bands.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;2,6&#8208;Difunctionalized dithieno[1,4]thiazines were efficiently synthesized by (pseudo)five&#8208; or (pseudo)three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot processes based on lithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences. As supported by structure&#8208;property relationships, the thiophene anellation mode predominantly controls the photophysical and electrochemical properties and the electronic structures (as obtained by DFT calculations). From molecular geometries and redox potentials to fluorescence quantum yields in solution, the interaction of the dithieno[1,4]thiazine&#8208;core with the substituents causes striking differences within the series of regioisomers.

      <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by Hybrid Streptavidin&#8208;Diiron Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Hybrid protein&#8208;organometallic catalysts are being explored for selective catalysis of a number of reactions, because they utilize the complementary strengths of proteins and of organometallic complex. Here, we present an artificial hydrogenase, StrepH2, built by incorporating a biotinylated [Fe&#8208;Fe] hydrogenase organometallic mimic within streptavidin. This strategy takes advantage of the remarkable strength and specificity of biotin&#8208;streptavidin recognition, which drives quantitative incorporation of the biotinylated diironhexacarbonyl center into streptavidin, as confirmed by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. FTIR spectra of StrepH2 show characteristic peaks at shift values indicative of interactions between the catalyst and the protein scaffold. StrepH2 catalyzes proton reduction to hydrogen in aqueous media during photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Under photocatalytic conditions, the protein&#8208;embedded catalyst shows enhanced efficiency and prolonged activity compared to the isolated catalyst. Transient absorption spectroscopy data suggest a mechanism for the observed increase in activity underpinned by an observed longer lifetime for the catalytic species Fe(I)Fe(0) when incorporated within streptavidin compared to the biotinylated catalyst in solution.</dc:description>

      <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of Internal and Terminal Alkenes via Remote Supramolecular Control</title>
      <dc:description>Regioselective catalytic transformations using supramolecular directing groups are increasingly popular as it allows for control over challenging reactions that may otherwise be impossible. In most examples the reactive group and the directing group are close to each other and/or the linker between the directing group is very rigid. Achieving control over the regioselectivity using a remote directing group with a flexible linker is significantly more challenging due to the large conformational freedom of such substrates. Herein, we report the redesign of a supramolecular Rh&#8208;bisphosphite hydroformylation catalyst containing a neutral carboxylate receptor (DIM pocket) with a larger distance between the phosphite metal binding moieties and the DIM pocket. For the first time regioselective conversion of internal and terminal alkenes containing a remote carboxylate directing group is demonstrated. For carboxylate substrates that possess an internal double bond at the &#916;&#8208;9 position regioselectivity is observed. As such, the catalyst was used to hydroformylate natural monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in a regioselective fashion, forming of an excess of the 10&#8208;formyl product (10&#8208;formyl/9&#8208;formyl product ratio of 2.51), which is the first report of a regioselective hydroformylation reaction of such substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery, synthesis and evaluation of a novel ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched&#8208;chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway, is a potential drug target for bacterial infections including  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  . Here, we have screened the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box against purified  M. tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI and identified two compounds that have K  i  values below 200 nM. In  Mt  cell susceptibility assays one of these compounds exhibited an IC  50  value of 0.8 &#956;M. Co&#8208;crystallization of this compound, 3&#8208;((methylsulfonyl)methyl)&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzo[  b  ][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;one (MMV553002), in complex with  Staphylococcus aureus  KARI, which has 56% identity with  Mt  KARI, NADPH and Mg  2+  yielded a structure to 1.72 &#197; resolution. However, only a hydrolyzed product of the inhibitor (  i.e.  3&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropanic acid, missing the 2&#8208;aminophenol attachment) is observed in the active site. Surprisingly,  Mt  cell susceptibility assays showed that the 2&#8208;aminophenol product is largely responsible for the anti&#8208;TB activity of the parent compound. Thus, we have identified 3&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropanic acid is a potent KARI inhibitor that could be further explored as a potential biocidal agent and we have shown 2&#8208;aminophenol, as an anti&#8208;TB drug lead, especially given it has low toxicity against human cells. The study highlights that careful analysis of broad screening assays is required to correctly interpret cell&#8208;based activity data.</dc:description>

      <title>Pyrrole Protected &#946;&#8208;Aminoalkylzinc Reagents for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Amino&#8208;Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylzinc halides were prepared starting from optically pure commercial &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;alcohols. These amino&#8208;alcohols were converted to the corresponding N&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;protected alkyl iodides which undergo a zinc insertion in the presence of LiCl (THF, 25 &#176;C, 10&#8211;90 min). Subsequent Negishi cross&#8208;couplings or acylations with acid chlorides produced amino&#8208;derivatives with retention of chirality. Diastereoselective CBS&#8208;reductions of some prepared N&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;ketones provided 1,3&#8208;subsituted N&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;alcohols with high diastereoselectivity. Additionally, a deprotection procedure involving an ozonolysis allowed the conversion of the pyrrole&#8208;ring into a formamide without loss of optical purity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylzinc halides were prepared starting from optically pure commercial &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;alcohols. These amino&#8208;alcohols were converted to the corresponding N&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;protected alkyl iodides which undergo a zinc insertion in the presence of LiCl (THF, 25 &#176;C, 10&#8211;90 min). Subsequent Negishi cross&#8208;couplings or acylations with acid chlorides produced amino&#8208;derivatives with retention of chirality. Diastereoselective CBS&#8208;reductions of some prepared N&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;ketones provided 1,3&#8208;subsituted N&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;alcohols with high diastereoselectivity. Additionally, a deprotection procedure involving an ozonolysis allowed the conversion of the pyrrole&#8208;ring into a formamide without loss of optical purity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The ABC of Insulin: The Organic Chemistry of a Small Protein</title>
      <dc:description>Insulin is a small protein crucial for regulating the blood glucose level in all animals. Since 1922 it has been used for the treatment of patients with diabetes. Despite consisting of just 51 amino acids, insulin contains 17 of the proteinogenic amino acids, A&#8208; and B&#8208;chains, three disulfide bridges, and it folds with 3 a&#8208;helices and a short b&#8208;sheet segment. Insulin associates into dimers and further into hexamers with stabilization by Zn2+ and phenolic ligands. Selective chemical modification of proteins is at the forefront of developments in chemical biology and biopharmaceuticals. Insulin&#8217;s structure has made it amenable to organic and inorganic chemical reactions. This review provides a synthetic organic chemistry perspective on this small protein. It gives an overview of key chemical and physico&#8208;chemical aspects of the insulin molecule, with a focus on chemoselective reactions. This includes N&#8208;acylations at the N&#8208;termini or at LysB29 by pH control, introduction of protecting groups on insulin, binding of metal ions, ligands to control the nano&#8208;scale assembly of insulin, and more.</dc:description>

      <title>Playing with PtII and ZnII Coordination to Obtain Luminescent Metallomesogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature mesomorphism was obtained for PtII and ZnII coordination complexes by playing with the coordination ability of a lipophilic gallate unit. The delicate balance between induction of mesomorphism and luminescence in condensed states is discussed (see figure).







Abstract
Blue&#8211;green luminescent terpyridine&#8208;containing PtII and ZnII complexes are reported. Equipped with lipophilic gallate units, which act as monodentate ancillary coordinating ligands and/or as anions, they display low&#8208;temperature mesomorphic properties (lamello&#8208;columnar and hexagonal mesophases for PtII and ZnII complexes, respectively). The mesomorphic properties were investigated by polarised optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X&#8208;ray scattering of bulk materials and oriented thin films. The model of self&#8208;assembly into the lamello&#8208;columnar phase of the PtII complex has been described in detail. The optical properties of the complexes were investigated in the liquid and condensed liquid crystalline states, highlighting the delicate balance between the role of the metal in determining the type of excited state responsible for the emission, and the role of the ancillary ligand in driving intermolecular interactions for proper mesophase formation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low&#8208;temperature mesomorphism&lt;/b&gt; was obtained for Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; coordination complexes by playing with the coordination ability of a lipophilic gallate unit. The delicate balance between induction of mesomorphism and luminescence in condensed states is discussed (see figure).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue&#8211;green luminescent terpyridine&#8208;containing Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are reported. Equipped with lipophilic gallate units, which act as monodentate ancillary coordinating ligands and/or as anions, they display low&#8208;temperature mesomorphic properties (lamello&#8208;columnar and hexagonal mesophases for Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, respectively). The mesomorphic properties were investigated by polarised optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X&#8208;ray scattering of bulk materials and oriented thin films. The model of self&#8208;assembly into the lamello&#8208;columnar phase of the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex has been described in detail. The optical properties of the complexes were investigated in the liquid and condensed liquid crystalline states, highlighting the delicate balance between the role of the metal in determining the type of excited state responsible for the emission, and the role of the ancillary ligand in driving intermolecular interactions for proper mesophase formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compressing a Non&#8208;Planar Aromatic Heterocyclic [7]Helicene to a Planar Hetero[8]Circulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting compressed: Non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core.







Abstract
This work describes a synthetic approach where a non&#8208;planar aromatic heterocyclic [7]helicene is compressed to yield a hetero[8]circulene containing an inner antiaromatic cyclooctatetraene (COT) core. This [8]circulene consists of four benzene rings and four heterocyclic rings, and it is the first heterocyclic [8]circulene containing three different heteroatoms. The synthetic pathway proceeds via a the flattened dehydro&#8208;hetero[7]helicene, which is partially a helicene and partially a circulene: it is non&#8208;planar and helically chiral as helicenes, and contains a COT motif like [8]circulenes. The antiaromaticity of the COT core is confirmed by nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. The planarization from a helically &#960;&#8208;conjugated [7]helicene to a fully planar heterocyclic [8]circulene significantly alters the spectroscopic properties of the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalization of the [7]helicenes and the [8]circulenes by oxygenation of the thiophene rings to the corresponding thiophene&#8208;sulfones allows an almost complete fluorescence emission coverage of the visible region of the optical spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal alkyne hydroboration with cage B&#8722;H of o&#8208;carborane has been achieved, leading to the controlled synthesis of a series of 3,6&#8208;[trans&#8208;(AlkCH=CH)]2&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (Alk=alkyl), 3&#8208;cis&#8208;(ArCH=CH)&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (Ar=aryl), and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;(ArCH=CH)&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;(AlkCH=CH)&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and very good cis&#8211;trans selectivity. The most electron&#8208;deficient B(3,6)&#8722;H vertices favor oxidative addition on electron&#8208;rich metal centers, which is responsible for the regioselectivity. On the other hand, the configuration of the resultant olefinic units is dominated by alkyne substituents. Alkyl groups lead to a trans&#8208;configuration whereas bulky aryl substitutions result in cis&#8208;configuration.

      <title>Hollow 3D Frame Structure Modified with NiCo2S4 Nanosheets and Spinous Fe2O3 Nanowires as Electrode Materials for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid construction: A 3D asymmetric supercapacitor system constructed from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and nanospinous Fe2O3 on hollow melamine foam/polypyrrole (MF/PPY) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, is reported. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an extended operation voltage window and good cycling stability (see figure).







Abstract
Supercapacitors have attracted tremendous research interest, since they are expected to achieve battery&#8208;level energy density, while having a long calendar life and short charging time. Herein, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor has been successfully assembled from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and spinous Fe2O3 nanowire modified hollow melamine foam decorated with polypyrrole as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Owing to the well&#8208;designed nanostructure and suitable matching of electrode materials, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibits an extended operation voltage window of 1.6&#8197;V with an energy density of 20.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 159.4&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the ASC shows stable cycling stability, with 81.3&#8201;% retention after 4000&#8197;cycles and a low internal resistance of 1.03&#8197;&#937;. Additionally, a 2.5&#8197;V light&#8208;emitting diode indicator can be lit up by three ASCs connected in series; this provides evidence of the practical application potential of the assembled energy&#8208;storage system. The excellent electrochemical performances should be credited to the significant enhancement of the specific surface area, charge transport, and mechanical stability resulting from the unique 3D morphology.

      <title>A Path to More Sustainable Catalysis: The Critical Role of LiBr in Avoiding Catalyst Death and its Impact on Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst death&#8230;.&#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is the poison, but LiBr is the cure! During the cross&#8208;coupling of alkylzincs to aryl electrophiles, Pd N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination followed by reductive elimination and aryl&#8208;reductive elimination to create the corresponding NHC&#8208;H or NHC&#8208;aryl salts, with the former being kinetically faster. The use of LiBr curtails this form of catalyst death and allows for dramatically higher turnover numbers (see scheme).







Abstract
The role that LiBr plays in the lifetime of Pd&#8208;NHC complexes has been investigated. A bromide ion is proposed to coordinate to Pd thereby preventing beta hydride elimination (BHE) (to form NHC&#8208;H+) of the reductive elimination (RE) intermediate that normally completes with the desired cross&#8208;coupling catalytic cycle. Coordinating groups, such as anilines, are able to bind suitably well to Pd to prevent this pathway from occurring, thus reducing the need for the added salt. The metal hydride formed from BHE is very unstable and RE of the hydride to the NHC ligand occurs very rapidly giving rise to the corresponding hydrido&#8208;NHC (i.e., NHC&#8208;H+). The use of the per deuterated dibutylzinc shows a significant deuterium isotope effect, shutting down catalyst death almost completely. The use of bis&#8208;neopentylzinc, now possessing no hydrides, eliminates catalyst death all together leading to a very long&#8208;lived catalytic cycle and confirming the untoward role of BHE.

      <title>Build polyoxometalate &#8220;nano&#8208;wall&#8221; on 3D porous carbon paper: a solar steam generation system for water purification</title>
      <dc:description>As a prospective fresh water purification device, solar steam generation system harvests great focus recently. But in practice, it often suffers from poor solar energy conversion efficiency and low water production rate due to failed material selection and improper microscopic structure design.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a prospective fresh water purification device, solar steam generation system harvests great focus recently. But in practice, it often suffers from poor solar energy conversion efficiency and low water production rate due to failed material selection and improper microscopic structure design.

      <title>Electronic Consequences of Ligand Substitution at Heterometal Centers in Polyoxovanadium Clusters: Controlling the Redox Properties via Heterometal Coordination Number</title>
      <dc:description>The rational control of the electrochemical properties of polyoxovandate&#8208;alkoxide clusters is dependent on understanding the influence of various synthetic modifications on the overall redox processes of these systems. In this work, we examine the electronic consequences of ligand substitution at the heteroion in a heterometal&#8208;functionalized cluster. The redox properties of [V  5  O  6  (OCH  3  )  12  FeCl] (  1&#8208;[V  5  FeCl]  ) and [V  5  O  6  (OCH  3  )  12  Fe]X (  2&#8208;[V  5  Fe]X  ; X = ClO  4  , OTf), were compared in order to assess the effects of changing the coordination environment around the iron center on the electrochemical properties of the cluster. Coordination of a chloride anion to iron leads to an anodic shift in redox events. Theoretical modelling of the electronic structure of these heterometal&#8208;functionalized clusters reveals, that differences in the redox profiles of  1&#8208;[V  5  FeCl]  and  2&#8208;[V  5  Fe]X  arise from changes in the number of ligands surrounding the iron center (e.g. 6&#8208;coordinate  vs  . 5&#8208;coordinate). Binding of the chloride to the sixth coordination site changes the orbital interaction between the iron and the delocalized electronic structure of the mixed&#8208;valent polyoxovanadate core. Tuning of the heterometal coordination environment can therefore be used to modulate the redox properties of the whole cluster.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Energy&#8208;Transfer Dynamics and Color Tunability of Na4CaSi3O9:Tb3+,Eu3+ for Warm White LEDs</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoluminescence properties of Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped Na4CaSi3O9 (NCSO) materials as well as the involved energy&#8208;transfer processes are systemically investigated, indicating the potential use of those phosphors in future lighting applications.







Abstract
In this work, a latent energy&#8208;transfer process in traditional Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped phosphors is proposed and a new class of Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped Na4CaSi3O9 (NCSO) phosphors is presented which is enabled by luminescence decay dynamics that optimize the electron&#8208;transfer energy process. Relative to other Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped phosphors, the as&#8208;synthesized Eu3+,Tb3+&#8208;doped NCSO phosphors show improved large&#8208;scale tunable emission color from green to red upon UV excitation, controlled by the Tb3+/Eu3+ doping ratio. Detailed spectroscopic measurements in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)/UV/Vis region were used to determine the Eu3+&#8211;O2&#8722; charge&#8208;transfer energy, 4f&#8211;5d transition energies, and the energies of 4f excited multiplets of Eu3+ and Tb3+ with different 4fN electronic configurations. The Tb3+&#8594;Eu3+ energy&#8208;transfer pathway in the co&#8208;doped sample was systematically investigated, by employing luminescence decay dynamics analysis to elucidate the relevant energy&#8208;transfer mechanism in combination with the appropriate model simulation. To demonstrate their application potential, a prototype white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) device was successfully fabricated by using the yellow luminescence NCSO:0.03Tb3+, 0.05Eu3+ phosphor with high thermal stability and a BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor in combination with a near&#8208;UV chip. These findings open up a new avenue to realize and develop multifunctional high&#8208;performance phosphors by manipulating the energy&#8208;transfer process for practical applications.

      <title>Distance Matters: Effect of the Spacer Length on the Photophysical Properties of Multimodular Perylenediimide&#8211;Silicon Phthalocyanine&#8211;Fullerene Triads</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced events: Excited state energy transfer leading to 1SiPc*, and electron transfer leading to PDI.&#8722;&#8208;SiPc.+&#8208;C60 charge separated state, in a newly synthesized covalently linked triad featuring C60 and perylene diimide connected at the opposite ends of axial positions of a SiPc, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor conjugate featuring silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) as the electron donor, and two electron acceptors, namely tetrachloroperylenediimide (PDI) and C60, placed at the opposite ends of the SiPc axial positions, was newly designed and synthesized, and the results were compared to the earlier reported PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. Minimal intramolecular interactions between the entities was observed. Absorption, fluorescence, computational and electrochemical studies were performed to evaluate the excitation energy, geometry and electronic structure, and energy levels of different photoevents. Steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence and excitation spectral studies revealed efficient singlet&#8211;singlet energy transfer from 1PDI* to SiPc in the PDI&#8208;SiPc dyad and the PDI&#8208;SiPc&#8208;C60 triad. The measured rates for these photochemical events were found to be much higher than those reported earlier for the triad, due to closer proximity between the PDI and SiPc entities. The distance also affected the charge separation path in which involvement of PDI, and not C60, in charge separation in the present triad was witnessed. The present investigation brings out the importance of donor&#8211;acceptor distances in channeling photochemical events in a multimodular system.

      <title>Structural Changes of Hierarchically Nanoporous Organosilica/Silica Hybrid Materials by Pseudomorphic Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report how pseudomorphic transformation of divinylbenzene (DVB)&#8208;bridged organosilica@controlled pore glasses (CPG) offers the possibility to generate hierarchically porous organosilica/silica hybrid materials. CPG is utilized to provide granular shape/size and macroporosity and the macropores of the CPG is impregnated with organosilica phase, forming hybrid system. By subsequent pseudomorphic transformation, an ordered mesopore phase is generated while maintaining the granular shape and macroporosity of the CPG. Surface areas and mesopore sizes in the hierarchical structure are tunable by the choice of the surfactant and transformation time. 2&#8208;dimensional magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that micellar&#8208;templating affects both organosilica and silica phases and pseudomorphic transformation induces phase transition. A double&#8208;layer structure of separate organosilica and silica layers is established for the impregnated material, while a single monophase consisting of randomly distributed T and Q silicon species at the molecular level is identified for the pseudomorphic transformed materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report how pseudomorphic transformation of divinylbenzene (DVB)&#8208;bridged organosilica@controlled pore glasses (CPG) offers the possibility to generate hierarchically porous organosilica/silica hybrid materials. CPG is utilized to provide granular shape/size and macroporosity and the macropores of the CPG is impregnated with organosilica phase, forming hybrid system. By subsequent pseudomorphic transformation, an ordered mesopore phase is generated while maintaining the granular shape and macroporosity of the CPG. Surface areas and mesopore sizes in the hierarchical structure are tunable by the choice of the surfactant and transformation time. 2&#8208;dimensional magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that micellar&#8208;templating affects both organosilica and silica phases and pseudomorphic transformation induces phase transition. A double&#8208;layer structure of separate organosilica and silica layers is established for the impregnated material, while a single monophase consisting of randomly distributed T and Q silicon species at the molecular level is identified for the pseudomorphic transformed materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Filling a Gap: The Coordinatively Saturated Group 4 Carbonyl Complexes TM(CO)8 (TM = Zr, Hf) and Ti(CO)7</title>
      <dc:description>Homoleptic group 4 metal&#8722;carbonyl cation and neutral complexes are prepared in the gas phase and/or in solid neon matrix. Infrared spectroscopy studies reveal that both zirconium and hafnium form octa&#8208;coordinate carbonyl neutral and cation complexes. In contrast, titanium forms only the six&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  6  +  and seven&#8208;coordinate Ti(CO)  7  . Titanium octacarbonyl Ti(CO)  8  is unstable due to steric repulsion between the CO ligands. The 20&#8208;electron Zr(CO)  8  and Hf(CO)  8  complexes represent the first experimentally observed homoleptic octacarbonyl neutral complexes of transition metals. The molecules still fulfill the 18 electron rule, because one doubly occupied valence orbital does not mix with any of the metal valence atomic orbitals. Zr(CO)  8  and Hf(CO)  8  are stable against the loss of one CO because the CO ligands encounter less steric repulsion than Zr(CO)  7  and Hf(CO)  7  . The heptacarbonyls have shorter metal&#8208;CO bonds than the octacarbonyls due to stronger electrostatic and covalent bonding, but the significantly smaller repulsive Pauli term makes the octacarbonyls stable. Our finding ends the decade&#8211;long search for the coordinately saturated group&#8208;4 carbonyl complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes: Progress, Challenges and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
How to prepare heterocycles: Ruthenium(II)&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is discussed, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although RuII centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many RuII&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that RuII centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In this Minireview, an overview of the RuII&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade is provided, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

      <title>Photoinitiated Thiol&#8208;ene Reactions of Enoses: A Powerful Tool for Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics with Challenging Glycosidic Linkages</title>
      <dc:description>
UV&#8208;light induced radical&#8208;mediated addition of thiols onto endo&#8208; or exo&#8208;cyclic double bonds of unsaturated sugars offers an easy and stereoselective route to a broad range of stable glycomimetics including 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosides and new types of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
Thioglycosides and C&#8208;glycosides represent pharmacologically useful classes of glycomimetics that possess a high degree of biological stability. One emerging tool for the stereoselective synthesis of thioglycosides is the photoinitiated addition of thiols to unsaturated sugars. Moreover, thiyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions of exo&#8208;glycals and 1&#8208;substituted endo&#8208;glycals offer facile routes to &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosidic structures. This Concept article summarizes the thiol&#8208;ene coupling strategies developed recently by our group and Soms&#225;k's group for the synthesis of several kinds of glycomimetics which are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods. One unusual characteristic of the thiol&#8208;ene reactions of endo&#8208;glycals is that heating inhibits, whereas cooling promotes the reaction. This unique temperature dependence as well as the effects of the enose structures and thiol configurations on the efficacy and stereoselectivity of the reactions are also discussed.

      <title>Solvophobically Driven Complexation of Adamantyl Mannoside with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin in Water and Structured Organic Solvents</title>
      <dc:description>
Favorable guest conditions: The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin are explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract
The effects of solvent and temperature on the complexation of adamantyl mannoside with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and 6&#8208;O&#8208;monotosyl&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin were explored experimentally and by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Efficient binding was observed only in hydrogen&#8208;bonded solvents, which indicated solvophobically driven complexation. The stability of the inclusion complex was considerably higher in aqueous media. A pronounced temperature dependence of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675;, resulting in perfect enthalpy&#8211;entropy compensation, was observed in water. The complexation thermodynamics was in line with classical rationale for the hydrophobic effect at lower temperatures and the nonclassical explanation at higher temperatures. This finding linked cyclodextrin complexation thermodynamics with insights regarding the effect of temperature on the hydration water structure. The complexation enthalpies and entropies were weakly dependent on temperature in organic media. The signs of &#916;rH&#9675; and &#916;rS&#9675; were in accordance with the nonclassical hydrophobic (solvophobic) effect. The structures of the optimized product corresponded to those deduced spectroscopically, and the calculated and experimentally obtained values of &#916;rG&#9675; were in very good agreement. This investigation clearly demonstrated that solvophobically driven formation of cyclodextrin complexes could be anticipated in structured solvents in general. However, unlike in water, adamantane and the host cavity behaved solely as structure breakers in the organic media explored so far.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Chalcogen Bonds: CSD and DFT Analyses and Biological Implication in Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive influences: Searches in the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Database in combination with theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory) show the importance of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonding interactions in crystal structures and in the inhibition mechanism of sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase.







Abstract
This study reports a combined Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical DFT study of charge assisted chalcogen bonds involving sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium cations. The chalcogen bond has been recently defined by IUPAC as the net attractive interaction between an electrophilic region associated with a chalcogen atom in a molecular entity and a nucleophilic region in another, or the same, molecular entity. Divalent chalcogen atoms typically have up to two &#963;&#8208;holes and forms up to two ChBs; the same holds for tetravalent chalcogens which adopt a seesaw arrangement. In sulfonium, selenonium, and telluronium salts chalcogen atoms form three covalent bonds, three &#963;&#8208;holes are located opposite to these bonds, and up to three charge assisted ChBs can be formed between these holes and the counterions. The covalent bond arrangement around these chalcogen atoms is similar to trivalent pnictogen atoms and translates into a similar pattern of noncovalent interactions. We have found and studied this type of charge&#8208;assisted chalcogen bonds in various sulfonium ion&#8208;containing inhibitors of glucosidase, for example, salacinol and kotalanol.

      <title>[2+2] Photodimerization of Stilbazoles Promoted by Oxalic Acid in Suspension</title>
      <dc:description>
A very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar or moderately polar solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy was also applied successfully to oily, waxy, and insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts.







Abstract
In this study, a very simple technique to perform efficiently photodimerization of some vinylpyridines is reported. By irradiating a stirred mixture of several stilbazoles with solid oxalic acid dihydrate dispersed in a nonpolar (i.e., cyclohexane) or moderately polar (benzene, dichloromethane, dioxane) solvent, the corresponding dimeric cyclobutane adducts were obtained in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. The strategy could also be applied successfully to oily, waxy, or even insoluble stilbazoles. Moreover, the oxalic acid loading could be lowered to substoichiometric amounts. When further optimizations were needed, our strategy was found to be highly flexible to identify other oligocarboxylic acids as alternative additives to improve, or even overturn, the regioselectivity. Oxalic acid and other oligocarboxylic acids were found to be capable of orienting more than 50 stilbazoles toward photodimerization under these conditions.

      <title>Light&#8208;driven flipping of azobenzene assemblies &#8213; sparse crystal structures and responsive behavior to polarized light</title>
      <dc:description>For creation of autonomous microrobots which are able to move under conditions of a constant environment and a constant energy supply, a mechanism for maintenance of mechanical motion with a capacity for self&#8208;control is required. This requirement, known as self&#8208;organisation, represents the ability of a system to evade equilibrium through formation of a spatio&#8208;temporal pattern.

In the anisotropic structure, a specific azobenzene molecule acts as a reaction centre for the conversion of light to a mechanical function process, while the other molecules act as modulators for spatio&#8208;pattern regulation.

      <title>Structural Tunability and Diversity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Lead Halide Benzenethiolate</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 (X=I, Br, or Cl), was synthesized and characterized with experimental and computational methods. These materials feature strong absorption, an extremely large Stokes Shift, and long carrier lifetimes. Interestingly, the bandgap can be tuned by choice of halide, with little to no effect on the photoluminescent emission.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials are currently of great interest for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Here, the synthesis and optical properties of a new type of halide&#8208;organothiolate&#8208;mixed 2D hybrid material, Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3, are reported, in which X is a halide (I, Br, or Cl). Different from conventional lead&#8208;based 2D layered materials, these compounds feature unusual five&#8208;coordinated lead centers with a stereochemically active electron lone pair on the lead atoms and four&#8208;coordinated iodine atoms. The Pb2X(S&#8208;C6H5)3 materials feature an indirect bandgap, strongly emissive long&#8208;lived self&#8208;trap states, and an extremely large Stokes shift. Interestingly, the optical bandgap of the materials can be tuned through variation of the halides; however, the photoluminescence is less sensitive to the composition and is more likely dominated by lead&#8208;sulfur lattice interactions or the lead lone&#8208;pair electrons. Our results support that a halide&#8211;organothiolate mixed anion hybrid structure offers a unique platform for discovering new exciting 2D electronic materials.

      <title>The Influence of Nucleophilic and Redox Pincer Character, and Alkali Metals, on Capture of Oxygen Substrates: The Case of Chromium(II)</title>
      <dc:description>Dimeric [CrL]  2  , where L is the conjugate base of  bis  &#8208;pyrazolyl pyridine, is evaluated for its ability to undergo inner sphere and outer sphere redox chemistry. It reacts with Cp  2  Fe  +  to give the surprising [Cr  4  (HL)  4  (&#956;  4  &#8208;O)]  2+  , still containing divalent Cr. Reduction (KC  8  ) of [CrL]  2  by 2 electrons gives [K  2  (THF)  3  Cr  3  L  3  (&#956;  3  &#8208;O)], and by 4 electrons gives [K  4  (THF)  10  Cr  2  L  2  (&#956;&#8208;O)], each of which has scavenged (hydr)oxide from glass surface because of the electrophilicity of the underligated Cr. The remarkable [K  4  (THF)  10  Cr  2  L  2  (&#956;&#8208;O)], is shown by comprehensive DFT calculations and analysis of intra&#8208;ligand bond lengths to contain a pyridyl radical L  3&#8722;  and Cr  II  , illustrating that this pincer is proton&#8208;responsive, redox active, and a versatile donor to associated K  +  ions here. The K  +  electrophiles interact with electron rich oxo, but do not significantly (&gt; 5 kcal/mol) alter spin state energies. Inner sphere oxidation of [CrL]  2  with a quinone gives [Cr  2  L  2  (semiquinone)  2  ], while pre&#8208;reduced [CrL]  2  2&#8722;  reacts with quinone to give [K  3  (THF)  3  Cr  2  L  2  (catecholate)  2  (&#956;&#8208;OH)], a product of capture of two undercoordinated LCr(catecholate)  1&#8722;  by hydroxide.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photoremovable protecting groups (PPG) have been exploited in a large set of chemical and biological applications, due to their ability to provide spatial and temporal control over light&#8208;triggered activation. In this work, we explore the concept of a new photocage compound based on the commercial UVA/UVB filter oxybenzone (OB, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone) for photoprotection and controlled release of carbonyl groups. The point here is that oxybenzone not only acts as a mere PPG, but also provides, once released, UV photoprotection to the carbonyl derivative.

      <title>Discovering intermetallics through synthesis, computation, and data&#8208;driven analysis</title>
      <dc:description>Intermetallics adopt an array of crystal structures, boast diverse chemical compositions, and possess exotic physical properties that have led to a wide range of applications from the biomedical to aerospace industries. Despite a long history of intermetallic synthesis and crystal structure analysis, identifying new intermetallic phases has remained challenging due to the prolonged nature of experimental phase space searching or the need for fortuitous discovery.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>
Straightforward &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis: Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed. This reaction proceeds through an intramolecular Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation in the presence of a first&#8208;row transition metal, Cu catalyst, and no DG installation is needed (see scheme).







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs because of their ubiquity in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams using tBuOOtBu. This method is based on Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky amidation and does not require prefunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds or the installation of a directing group, thereby allowing for the straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams. Our intramolecular functionalization protocol can be extended to diverse benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and shows excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance.

      <title>Atom&#8208;Ratio&#8208;Conducted Tailoring of PdAu Bimetallic Nanocrystals with Distinctive Shapes and Dimensions for Boosting the ORR Performance
</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction: 2D PdAu porous nanosheets (PNSs) demonstrate outstanding oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction performance compare to 1D anisotropic nanowires (NWs), 3D penetrative nanofibers (NFs) and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels.







Abstract
Systematically manipulating the shape, dimension, and surface structure of PdAu nanocrystals is an active subject because it offers a powerful means to regulate and investigate their structure&#8211;activity relationship. Meanwhile, it is still urgent to reduce the use of two&#8208;dimensional precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials. This work demonstrates that PdAu nanocrystals with a variety of shapes/dimensions, including 1D anisotropic nanowires, 2D porous nanosheets, and 3D penetrative nanoflowers, can be systematically synthesized by simply adjusting the atomic ratio or the reaction time in the same protocol. The resultant PdAu nanocrystals with distinctive shapes, but the same building blocks triumphantly avoid the effects of facet and surface properties; this represents an ideal platform for directly comparing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. 2D porous PdAu nanosheets demonstrate superior ORR performance (Eonset = 1.040&#8197;V, E1/2 = 0.932&#8197;V) compared with other&#8208;dimension&#8208;based samples and commercial Pd black; this is attributed to the abundant surface atoms and omni&#8208;directional mass&#8208;transfer channels. This work not only paves the way for systematically measuring a series of distinctive PdAu nanocrystals as non&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts, but also sheds light on the study of structures/dimensions in tuning the catalytic properties of bimetallic nanocrystals.

      <title>Sulfinyl&#8208;Mediated Stereoselective Functionalization of Acyclic Conjugated Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rearrangements: A methodology to prepare acyclic unsaturated 1,4&#8208;diol derivatives from conjugated sulfinyl dienes has been developed. A cascade process that entails nucleophilic addition to produce a functionalized allylic sulfoxide, followed by [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and sulfenate cleavage renders the target molecules with high yields and selectivities (see scheme).







Abstract
The chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled functionalization of conjugated sulfinyl dienes in a cascade process that involves a conjugate addition, diastereoselective protonation and a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is reported. Enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;diol and 1,4&#8208;aminoalcohol derivatives are obtained in a very straightforward manner. Further functionalization of these structures, including highly stereoselective epoxidation, dihydroxylation and the stereodivergent synthesis of several polyols in a controlled fashion is described.

      <title>How to Bend a Cumulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend it: [n]Cumulenes are known for the linearity of their carbon chains, but when the terminal groups are N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, this situation changes. The even cumulenes of this family can be bent depending on the &#960; acidity of the carbene terminal group. Poor &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the carbon chain to the terminal group promotes a significant bending in the carbon chain.







Abstract
Allenes (carbodicarbenes) and [3]cumulenes are linear carbon chains that can be bent when the terminal group has a strong carbene nature. This bending can be quite pronounced in allenes but not in [3]cumulenes. In this study, how N&#8208;heterocyclic or cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (NHC and CAAC, respectively) terminal groups can modify the linear structure of [n]cumulenes has been analyzed. A low &#960; acidity of the terminal carbene affects the linearity of [2n]cumulenes. Indeed, it has been found that the NHC [4]cumulene is extremely bent, contrary to classical [4]cumulenes. The predicted NHC [4]cumulene or tricarbodicarbene has two lone pairs and the &#960; electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule. More significantly, DFT calculations have shown that this bent [4]cumulene is very stable, considerably more so than the corresponding [3]cumulene, which has been elusive to synthesize. Remarkably, calculations have shown that all the NHC [2n]cumulenes are more than 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the [2n&#8722;1]cumulenes.

      <title>Bifunctional Catalysts for Reversible Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional oxygen catalysts require multiactive centers to catalyze both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Metal/heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon composites with abundant active centers have been proven to have outstanding performance when replacing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based bifunctional oxygen catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) and reversible fuel cells (RFCs) rely on the bifunctional oxygen catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

     alt="Bifunctional Catalysts for Reversible Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bifunctional oxygen catalysts&lt;/b&gt; require multiactive centers to catalyze both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Metal/heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon composites with abundant active centers have been proven to have outstanding performance when replacing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based bifunctional oxygen catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) and reversible fuel cells (RFCs) rely on the bifunctional oxygen catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finding efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts is the ultimate goal and it has attracted a great deal of attention. The dilemma is that a good ORR catalyst is not necessarily efficient for OER, and vice versa. Thus, the development of a new type of bifunctional oxygen catalysts should ensure that the catalysts exhibit high activity for both OER and ORR. Composites with multicomponents for active centers supported on highly conductive matrices could be able to meet the challenges and offering new opportunities. In this Review, the evolution of bifunctional catalysts is summarized and discussed aiming to deliver high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Facile Grinding Method for the Synthesis of 3D Ag Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Containing Ag6Mo7O24 for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
The daily grind: Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) compounds are successfully synthesized by a simple grinding method. The resulting {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) has the high specific capacitance of 971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 (higher than other compounds), excellent rate ability, and long cycle stability. In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Successful synthesis of three kinds of dynamically stable compounds by a simple grinding method is reported, giving Ag6Mo7O24, Ag&#8208;BTC (Ag&#8208;MOF, BTC=benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid), and {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). According to the electrochemical dynamic analysis, these materials have pseudocapacitor behavior and high capacitance. The unique nanorod structure of {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF provides more active sites, faster ion/electron transfer, and electrolyte diffusion pathways, resulting in excellent specific capacitance (971&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) higher than the other compounds. {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF (glassy carbon electrode) also has an excellent rate ability (60.1&#8201;%) and long cycle stability (98&#8201;% retention after 5000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the fully symmetrical button battery (with nickel foam as the current collector) fabricated with {Ag6Mo7O24}@Ag&#8208;MOF delivers an energy density of 11.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 600.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 coupled with excellent cycling stability (86.4&#8201;%) at 1.2&#8197;V. These results demonstrate a new simple grinding method to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) for high&#8208;performance materials.

      <title>Are Hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes Aromatic or Not? A DFT Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>
Calculating substitutes: Aromaticity dependence is found in hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes. Specifically, metallazapentalene exhibits comparable aromaticity to that of metallapentalene, whereas lower aromaticity and nonaromaticity are suggested in metallaborapentalene and metalloxapentalene, respectively.







Abstract
Aromaticity is one of the most basic concepts in organic chemistry. The planar M&#246;bius aromatic metallapentalynes and metallapentalenes have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. However, the aromaticity of metallapentalenes containing heteroatoms (such as B, N, and O), termed as hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes, is rarely studied. Herein, the stability and aromaticity of a series of hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes are theoretically investigated. The results reveal lower aromaticity in metallaborapentalene, comparable aromaticity in metallazapentalene, and nonaromaticity in metalloxapentalene relative to that of metallapentalene. Moreover, the effect of Lewis bases on the aromaticity and stability of metallaborapentalene is discussed. These results provide useful information for experimental chemists to realize more hetero&#8208;metallapentalenes.

      <title>Functionalised N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Bimetallic Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic carbene complexes: This minireview covers the use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands in the formation of bimetallic architectures. NHCs are shown to bind one metal through the conventional C2 position and coordinate to another through donor atoms tethered to the NHC, through the N atom itself or through the NHC backbone. These bimetallic species are potentially useful models for decomposition reactions in homogeneous catalysis and organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become immensely successful ligands in coordination chemistry and homogeneous catalysis due to their strong terminal &#963;&#8208;donor properties. However, by targeting NHC ligands with additional functionalisation, a new area of NHC coordination chemistry has developed that has enabled NHCs to be used to build up bimetallic and multimetallic architectures. This minireview covers the development of functionalised NHC ligands that incorporate additional donor sites in order to coordinate two or more metal atoms. This can be through the N&#8208;atom of the NHC ring, through a donor group attached to the N&#8208;atom or the carbon backbone, coordination of the &#960;&#8208;bond or an annulated &#960;&#8208;donor on the backbone, or through direct metalation of the backbone.

      <title>Strategies for the Controlled Covalent Double Functionalization of Graphene Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Twice is better than once: A double and mild functionalization strategy of graphene oxide is reported based on the combination of a nucleophilic epoxide opening and hydroxyl derivatization by esterification or Williamson reaction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile platform with unique properties that have found broad applications in the biomedical field. Double functionalization is a key aspect in the design of multifunctional GO with combined imaging, targeting, and therapeutic properties. Compared to noncovalent functionalization, covalent strategies lead to GO conjugates with a higher stability in biological fluids. However, only a few double covalent functionalization approaches have been developed so far. The complexity of GO makes the derivatization of the oxygenated groups difficult to control. The combination of a nucleophilic epoxide ring opening with the derivatization of the hydroxyl groups through esterification or Williamson reaction was investigated. The conditions were selective and mild, thus preserving the structure of GO. Our strategy of double functionalization holds great potential for different applications in which the derivatization of GO with different molecules is needed, especially in the biomedical field.

      <title>A Reusable CNT&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of C&#8722;N Bonds
</title>
      <dc:description>
A superior commoner! A reusable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs, prepared from iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been used for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. The catalytic performance superior to those of noble&#8208;metal catalysts such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. This outstanding performance originates from the introduction of Fe&#8208;Nx into the CNTs and the resulting electronic coupling between the iron species and the CNTs.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation is regarded as a very useful and fundamental reaction for the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Noble&#8208;metal and homogeneous catalysts have frequently been used for C&#8722;N bond formation, however, these catalysts have a number of disadvantages, such as high cost, toxicity, and low atom economy. In this work, a low&#8208;toxic and cheap iron complex (iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) has been loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to prepare a heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) named Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs. We employed this SAC in the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds for the first time. It was found that Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs is an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds starting from aromatic amines and ketones. Its catalytic performance was excellent, giving yields of up to 96&#8201;%, six&#8208;fold higher than the yields obtained with noble&#8208;metal catalysts, such as AuCl3/CNTs and RhCl3/CNTs. The catalyst showed efficacy in the reactions of thirteen aromatic amine substrates, without the need for additives, and seventeen enaminones were obtained. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iron species were well dispersed in the Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst as single atoms and that Fe&#8208;Nx might be the catalytic active species. This Fe&#8208;Nx/CNTs catalyst has potential industrial applications as it could be cycled seven times without any significant loss of activity.

     alt="A Reusable CNT&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of C&#8722;N Bonds&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A superior commoner&lt;/b&gt;! A reusable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs, prepared from iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been used for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. The catalytic performance superior to those of noble&#8208;metal catalysts such as AuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs and RhCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs. This outstanding performance originates from the introduction of Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; into the CNTs and the resulting electronic coupling between the iron species and the CNTs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;N bond formation is regarded as a very useful and fundamental reaction for the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Noble&#8208;metal and homogeneous catalysts have frequently been used for C&#8722;N bond formation, however, these catalysts have a number of disadvantages, such as high cost, toxicity, and low atom economy. In this work, a low&#8208;toxic and cheap iron complex (iron ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) has been loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to prepare a heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) named Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs. We employed this SAC in the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds for the first time. It was found that Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs is an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds starting from aromatic amines and ketones. Its catalytic performance was excellent, giving yields of up to 96&#8201;%, six&#8208;fold higher than the yields obtained with noble&#8208;metal catalysts, such as AuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs and RhCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs. The catalyst showed efficacy in the reactions of thirteen aromatic amine substrates, without the need for additives, and seventeen enaminones were obtained. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iron species were well dispersed in the Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs catalyst as single atoms and that Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; might be the catalytic active species. This Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs catalyst has potential industrial applications as it could be cycled seven times without any significant loss of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Regiodivergent Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Mupirocin Methyl Ester</title>
      <dc:description>
endo vs. exo: Chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are used for achieving regiocontrol over the endo vs. exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin methyl ester. This approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. The mechanism of these reactions is investigated by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions.







Abstract
This article presents a new strategy for achieving regiocontrol over the endo versus exo modes of cycloisomerizations of epoxide&#8208;containing alcohols, which leads to the formation of five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered cyclic ethers. Unlike traditional methods relying on achiral reagents or enzymes, this approach utilizes chiral phosphoric acids to catalyze the regiodivergent selective formations of either tetrahydrofuran&#8208; or tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing products. By using methyl ester of epoxide&#8208;containing antibiotic mupirocin as the substrate, it is demonstrated that catalytic chiral phosphoric acids (R)&#8208;TCYP and (S)&#8208;TIPSY could be used to achieve the selective formation of either the six&#8208;membered endo product (95:5 r.r.) or the five&#8208;membered exo product (77:23 r.r.), correspondingly. This cyclization was found to be unselective under the standard conditions involving various achiral acids, bases, or buffers. The subsequent mechanistic studies using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical solutions provided the description of the potential energy surface, which is fully consistent with the experimental observations. Based on these results, highly detailed reaction paths are obtained and a concerted and highly synchronous mechanism is proposed for the formation of both exo and endo products.

      <title>Engineering of Laccase CueO for Improved Electron Transfer in Bioelectrocatalysis by Semi&#8208;Rational Design</title>
      <dc:description>
As a promising cathodic biocatalyst in enzymatic biofuel cells, laccase CueO catalyzes oxygen reduction efficiently thanks to the supplemental Cu binding. Substituting at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu binding site was shown to enable the manipulation of electrocatalytic current, which is more remarkable than substitution at the conventional Cu active sites.







Abstract
Copper efflux oxidase (CueO) from Escherichia coli is a special bacterial laccase due to its fifth copper binding site. Herein, it is discovered that the fifth Cu occupancy plays a crucial and favorable role of electron relay in bioelectrocatalytic oxygen reduction. By substituting the residues at the four coordinated positions of the fifth Cu, 11 beneficial variants are identified with &#8805;2.5&#8208;fold increased currents at &#8722;250&#8197;mV (up to 6.13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Detailed electrocatalytic characterization suggests the microenvironment of the fifth Cu binding site governs the electrocatalytic current of CueO. Additionally, further electron transfer analysis assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation demonstrates that an increase in localized structural stability and a decrease of distance between the fifth Cu and the T1 Cu are two main factors contributing to the improved kinetics of CueO variants. It may guide a novel way to tailor laccases and perhaps other oxidoreductases for bioelectrocatalytic applications.

      <title>Effect of Axial Ligands on Easy&#8208;Axis Anisotropy and Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Heptacoordinated FeII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic anisotropy in FeII complexes: Three new heptacoordinated FeII complexes of the general formulae [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The magnitude of the easy&#8208;axis anisotropy of complex 3 is larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to weak d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; interactions between the &#960; orbitals of the metal and the axial donor ligands.







Abstract
A rational approach to modulating easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy by varying the axial donor ligand in heptacoordinated FeII complexes has been explored. In this series of complexes with formulae of [Fe(H4L)(NCS)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Fe(H4L)(NCSe)2]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF&#8901;0.5&#8201;H2O (2), and [Fe(H4L)(NCNCN)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (3) [H4L=2,2&#8242;&#8208;{pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylbis(ethan&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)}bis(N&#8208;phenylhydrazinecarboxamide)], the axial positions are successively occupied by different nitrogen&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;donor ligands. Detailed dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal the existence of easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy for all of the complexes, with 1 [Ueff=21&#8197;K, &#964;0=1.72&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] and 2 [Ueff=25&#8197;K, &#964;0=2.25&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;s] showing field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior. However, both experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate the magnitude of the D value of complex 3 to be larger than those of complexes 1 and 2 due to the axial bond angle being smaller than that for an ideal geometry. Detailed analysis of the field and temperature dependences of relaxation time for 1 and 2 has revealed that multiple relaxation processes (quantum tunneling of magnetization, direct, and Raman) are involved in slow magnetic relaxation for both of these complexes. Magnetic dilution experiments support the role of intermolecular short contacts.

      <title>Combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy Using Polyfunctionalised Nanoparticles Bearing Robust Gadolinium Surface Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhancing contrast: The straightforward synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles combines the robust attachment of gadolinium units for enhanced MRI contrast with photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
A robust dithiocarbamate tether allows novel gadolinium units based on DOTAGA (q=1) to be attached to the surface of gold nanoparticles (2.6&#8211;4.1&#8197;nm diameter) along with functional units offering biocompatibility, targeting and photodynamic therapy. A dramatic increase in relaxivity (r1) per Gd unit from 5.01&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in unbound form to 31.68&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (10&#8197;MHz, 37&#8201;&#176;C) is observed when immobilised on the surface due to restricted rotation and enhanced rigidity of the Gd complex on the nanoparticle surface. The single&#8208;step synthetic route provides a straightforward and versatile way of preparing multifunctional gold nanoparticles, including examples with conjugated zinc&#8211;tetraphenylporphyrin photosensitizers. The lack of toxicity of these materials (MTT assays) is transformed on irradiation of HeLa cells for 30&#8197;minutes (PDT), leading to 75&#8201;% cell death. In addition to passive targeting, the inclusion of units capable of actively targeting overexpressed folate receptors illustrates the potential of these assemblies as targeted theranostic agents.

      <title>Reassessment of an Innovative Insulin Analogue Excludes Protracted Action yet Highlights the Distinction between External and Internal Diselenide Bridges</title>
      <dc:description>
A seleno&#8208;analogue of bovine insulin, Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB], in which the external interchain disulfide bond A7&#8722;B7 was replaced by diselenide, preserves biological activity but does not augment stability, protect from proteolysis or confer protracted action.







Abstract
Long&#8208;acting insulin analogues represent the most prescribed class of therapeutic proteins. An innovative design strategy was recently proposed: diselenide substitution of an external disulfide bridge. This approach exploited the distinctive physicochemical properties of selenocysteine (U). Relative to wild type (WT), Se&#8208;insulin[C7UA, C7UB] was reported to be protected from proteolysis by insulin&#8208;degrading enzyme (IDE), predicting prolonged activity. Because of this strategy's novelty and potential clinical importance, we sought to validate these findings and test their therapeutic utility in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. Surprisingly, the analogue did not exhibit enhanced stability, and its susceptibility to cleavage by either IDE or a canonical serine protease (glutamyl endopeptidase Glu&#8208;C) was similar to WT. Moreover, the analogue's pharmacodynamic profile in rats was not prolonged relative to a rapid&#8208;acting clinical analogue (insulin lispro). Although [C7UA, C7UB] does not confer protracted action, nonetheless its comparison to internal diselenide bridges promises to provide broad biophysical insight.

      <title>Exploring Opportunities for Platinum Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Porous Liquids as Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous liquids for catalysts: Platinum nanoparticles encapsulated within a Type&#8197;I porous liquid are successfully employed for the first time as hydrogenation catalysts. In addition, this work explores the effect of each component of the corona&#8208;canopy on the catalytic activity.







Abstract
The unusual combination of characteristics observed for porous liquids, which are typically associated with either porous solids or liquids, has led to considerable interest in this new class of materials. However, these porous liquids have so far only been investigated for their ability to separate and store gases. Herein, the catalytic capability of Pt nanoparticles encapsulated within a Type&#8197;I porous liquid (Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2 PL) is explored for the hydrogenation of several alkenes and nitroarenes under mild conditions (T=40&#8201;&#176;C, PH2=1&#8197;atm). The different intermediates in the porous liquid synthesis (i.e., the initial Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2, the organosilane&#8208;functionalized intermediate, and the final porous liquid) are employed as catalysts in order to understand the effect of each component of the porous liquid on the catalysis. For the hydrogenation of 1&#8208;decene, the Pt@HS&#8208;SiO2 PL catalyst in ethanol has the fastest reaction rate if normalized with respect to the concentration of Pt. The reaction rate slows if the reaction is completed in a &#8220;neat&#8221; porous liquid system, probably because of the high viscosity of the system. These systems may find application in cascade reactions, in particular, for those with mutually incompatible catalysts.

      <title>Untapped Opportunities of Resin&#8208;to&#8208;Resin Transfer Reactions (RRTR) for the Convergent Assembly of Multivalent Peptide Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>
Resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions provide a strategic shortcut to convergent peptide assembly, and offer practical advantages with respect to the associated handling issues. Nonetheless, these assets have remained untapped so far and, in this work, this methodology was successfully adopted for the construction of a peptidosteroid adduct. Readily obtained by a fully solid&#8208;phase&#8208;based procedure, our model confirms the synthetic utility and renews the relevance of RRTR to bioconjugate designs.







Abstract
Handling of the individual fragments remains a bottleneck in the convergent assembly of peptides. Overlooked since the emergence of ligation chemistries during the past two decades, so&#8208;called resin&#8208;to&#8208;resin transfer reactions (RRTR) are here reported as a strategic shortcut in this context. Condensation of the involved moieties at an acceptor resin is facilitated by shuttling peptide segments directly from a donor resin in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The straightforward synthesis of a sterically constrained 13&#8208;mer peptidosteroid model illustrates the utility of this approach. The first successful application of the RRTR methodology in the field of multivalent design and bioconjugation is here reported. Relying on established procedures to generate, monitor and isolate intermediates and products, the solid&#8208;phase nature of our entire strategy allows for the fast construction of polypeptide adducts and libraries thereof. As such, a rejuvenated use and new opportunities for RRTR is reported.

Abstract
Facile redox&#8208;induced aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic interconversions were accomplished by using &#946;&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;21,23&#8208;dithiaporphyrin (CN4S2Por). Introduced cyano groups not only increased the reduction potential of the porphyrin core but also stabilized the antiaromatic isophlorin (CN4S2Iph) by &#960; conjugation. The reduction of CN4S2Por with hydrazine in polar solvents quantitatively affords CN4S2Iph, even under ambient conditions. CN4S2Iph retains a nearly planar conformation and exhibits considerable antiaromaticity. Aerobic oxidation of CN4S2Iph to CN4S2Por occurs in nonpolar solvents. This study was conducted to contribute to the understanding of the structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationship.

      <title>Insights into the Control of Optoelectronic Properties in Mixed&#8208;Stacking Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;stacking cocrystals: A series of mixed&#8208;stacking cocrystals (TMFA, TMCA, and TMTQ) were synthesized to systematically investigate the regulatory effects of their different acceptors (A) on the co&#8208;assembly behaviors, energy&#8208;level structures, and thus optoelectronic characteristics, such as dominant hole or electron transport and on/off switching of the photoresponse. Owing to the excellent photoresponse of TMCA, TMCA&#8208;based phototransistors were studied in depth.







Abstract
Although cocrystallization has provided a promising platform to develop new organic optoelectronic materials, it is still a big challenge to purposely design and achieve specific optoelectronic properties. Herein, a series of mixed&#8208;stacking cocrystals (TMFA, TMCA, and TMTQ) were designed and synthesized, and the regulatory effects of the acceptors on the co&#8208;assembly behavior, charge&#8208;transfer nature, energy&#8208;level structures, and optoelectronic characteristics were systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve effective charge&#8208;transport tuning and photoresponse switching by carefully regulating the intermolecular charge transfer and energy orbitals. The inherent mechanisms underlying the change in these optoelectronic behaviors were analyzed in depth and elucidated to provide clear guidelines for future development of new optoelectronic materials. In addition, due to the excellent photoresponsive characteristics of TMCA, TMCA&#8208;based phototransistors were investigated with varying light wavelength and optical power, and TMCA shows the best performance among all reported cocrystals under UV illumination.

      <title>Chemiluminescent Carbapenem&#8208;Based Molecular Probe for Detection of Carbapenemase Activity in Live Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective sensing: The design, synthesis, and activity of the first carbapenemase&#8208;sensitive chemiluminescent probe CPCL are described. The ability of the probe to detect a number of clinically relevant carbapenemases, as well as live bacteria with carbapenemase genes (CPO), is successfully demonstrated (see scheme).







Abstract
Carbapenemase&#8208;producing organisms (CPOs) pose a severe threat to antibacterial treatment due to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. This resistance can be largely attributed to the antibiotic&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes that the bacteria produce. Current carbapenem &#8220;wonder drugs&#8221;, such as doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem, and so on, are resistant to regular &#946;&#8208;lactamases, but susceptible to carbapenemases. Even worse, extended exposure of bacteria to these drugs accelerates the spread of resistance genes. In order to preserve the clinical efficacy of antibacterial treatment, carbapenem drugs should be carefully regulated and deployed only in cases of a CPO infection. Early diagnosis is therefore of paramount importance. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and activity of the first carbapenemase&#8208;sensitive chemiluminescent probe, CPCL, which may be used to monitor CPO activity. The design of our probe enables enzymatic cleavage of the carbapenem core, which is followed by a facile 1,8&#8208;elimination process and the emission of green light through rapid chemical excitation. We have demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect a number of clinically relevant carbapenemases and the successful identification of CPO present in bacterial cultures, such as those used for clinical diagnosis. We believe that our use of &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; chemiluminescence activation will find significant application in future diagnostic assays and improve antibacterial treatment.

      <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing in the Tr&#246;ger's Base Derived From 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Application as a Potent Photodynamic Therapy Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>
Tr&#246;ger's base as photosensitizer: Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) was discovered in naphthalimide&#8208;derived Tr&#246;ger's base NI&#8208;TB, which provides a novel molecular structural motif for attaining efficient spin&#8211;orbital charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The fully rigid, orthogonal structure is beneficial for efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC. The ISC mechanism was confirmed by time&#8208;resolved (TR) EPR spectroscopy. NI&#8208;TB is a potent photodynamic therapy reagent towards HeLa cells (EC50=5.0&#8197;nm)







Abstract
Intersystem crossing (ISC) was observed for naphthalimide (NI)&#8208;derived Tr&#246;ger's base, and the ISC was confirmed to occur by a spin&#8208;orbital charge&#8208;transfer (SOCT) mechanism. Conventional electron donor/acceptor dyads showing SOCT&#8208;ISC have semirigid linkers. In contrast, the linker between the two chromophores in Tr&#246;ger's base is rigid and torsion is completely inhibited, which is beneficial for efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra demonstrated charge&#8208;separation and charge&#8208;recombination&#8208;induced ISC processes. Nanosecond TA spectroscopy confirmed the ISC, and the triplet state is long&#8208;lived (46&#8197;&#956;s, room temperature). The ISC quantum yield is dependent on solvent polarity (8&#8211;41&#8201;%). The triplet state was studied by pulsed&#8208;laser&#8208;excited time&#8208;resolved EPR spectroscopy, and both the NI&#8208;localized triplet state and triplet charge&#8208;transfer state were observed, which is in good agreement with the spin&#8208;density analysis. The Tr&#246;ger's base was confirmed to be a potent photodynamic therapy reagent with HeLa cells (EC50=5.0&#8197;nm).

      <title>Tandem Acid/Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Rearrangement of Glycol Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Easy to handle: Glycol derivatives are rearranged under the catalysis of sulfonic acids and subsequently reduced by a unique Pd/diphosphine (dtbpx=&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene) catalyst system with formic acid as transfer reductant. A [1,2] hydrogen shift leading to the subsequent formation of an aldehyde was identified as key step of the transformation, and a PdII&#8211;hydride complex is assumed as active hydrogenation catalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the acid/Pd&#8208;tandem&#8208;catalyzed transformation of glycol derivatives into terminal formic esters. Mechanistic investigations show that the substrate undergoes rearrangement to an aldehyde under [1,2] hydrogen migration and cleavage of an oxygen&#8208;based leaving group. The leaving group is trapped as its formic ester, and the aldehyde is reduced and subsequently esterified to a formate. Whereas the rearrangement to the aldehyde is catalyzed by sulfonic acids, the reduction step requires a unique catalyst system comprising a PdII or Pd0 precursor in loadings as low as 0.75&#8197;mol&#8201;% and &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;o&#8208;xylene as ligand. The reduction step makes use of formic acid as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reductant. The substrate scope of the transformation encompasses both aromatic and aliphatic substrates and a variety of leaving groups.

      <title>Multi&#8208;Spectroscopic Interrogation of the Spatial Linker Distribution in Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystals: The [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] Showcase
</title>
      <dc:description>
Questioning the Suspects! Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy has revealed that defective 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC) linkers are located only in some crystals of [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] (BTC=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate) after co&#8208;crystallization into defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy in combination with other bulk techniques has shed light on the effects of this dispersion on the material (e.g., on metal oxidation state, the formation of mesopores or the crystal size).







Abstract
In the past few years, defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (DEMOFs) have been studied due to the plethora of textural, catalytic, or magnetic properties that can be enhanced by carefully introducing defect sites into the crystal lattices of MOFs. In this work, the spatial distribution of two different non&#8208;defective and defective linkers, namely 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) and 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (CYDC), respectively, has been studied in different DEMOF crystals of the HKUST&#8208;1 topology. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy revealed a nonhomogeneous distribution of defect sites within the [Cu3(btc)2&#8722;x(cydc)x] crystals, with the CYDC linker incorporated into defect&#8208;rich or defect&#8208;free areas of selected crystals. Additionally, advanced bulk techniques have shed light on the nature of the copper species, which is highly dynamic and directly affects the reactivity of the copper sites, as shown by probe molecule FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed the effect of co&#8208;crystallizing CYDC and BTC on the crystal size and the formation of mesopores, further corroborated by X&#8208;ray scattering analysis. In this way we have demonstrated the necessity of utilizing micro&#8208;spectroscopy along with a whole array of bulk spectroscopic techniques to fully describe multicomponent metal&#8211;organic frameworks.

      <title>Epitaxial Cubic Silicon Carbide Photocathodes for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Thin films: For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level.







Abstract
Cubic silicon carbide (3C&#8208;SiC) material feature a suitable bandgap and high resistance to photocorrosion. Thus, it has been emerged as a promising semiconductor for hydrogen evolution. Here, the relationship between the photoelectrochemical properties and the microstructures of different SiC materials is demonstrated. For visible&#8208;light&#8208;derived water splitting to hydrogen production, nanocrystalline, microcrystalline and epitaxial (001) 3C&#8208;SiC films are applied as the photocathodes. The epitaxial 3C&#8208;SiC film presents the highest photoelectrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution, because of its perfect (001) orientation, high phase purity, low resistance, and negative conduction band energy level. This finding offers a strategy to design SiC&#8208;based photocathodes with superior photoelectrochemical performances.

      <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Dynamics of Struvite Crystallization: Insights from the Macroscopic to Molecular Scale</title>
      <dc:description>
Going with the flow: A microfluidics platform for assessing crystal growth under flow conditions is used to characterize struvite crystallization over a range of synthesis conditions. A combination of in situ microfluidic assays and atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that struvite predominantly grows by a classical pathway involving layered surface growth through the addition of solute ions/molecules (see figure; the image of the encrusted catheter has been reprinted by permission from Springer Nature and Elsevier).







Abstract
The crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (struvite) often occurs under conditions of fluid flow, yet the dynamics of struvite growth under these relevant environments has not been previously reported. In this study, we use a microfluidic device to evaluate the anisotropic growth of struvite crystals at variable flow rates and solution supersaturation. We show that bulk crystallization under quiescent conditions yields irreproducible data owing to the propensity of struvite to adopt defects in its crystal lattice, as well as fluctuations in pH that markedly impact crystal growth rates. Studies in microfluidic channels allow for time&#8208;resolved analysis of seeded growth along all three principle crystallographic directions and under highly controlled environments. After having first identified flow rates that differentiate diffusion and reaction limited growth regimes, we operated solely in the latter regime to extract the kinetic rates of struvite growth along the [100], [010], and [001] directions. In situ atomic force microscopy was used to obtain molecular level details of surface growth mechanisms. Our findings reveal a classical pathway of crystallization by monomer addition with the expected transition from growth by screw dislocations at low supersaturation to that of two&#8208;dimensional layer generation and spreading at high supersaturation. Collectively, these studies present a platform for assessing struvite crystallization under flow conditions and demonstrate how this approach is superior to measurements under quiescent conditions.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Nanoswitches: Solvent&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement of Copper Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Multicolor fluorescence emission: Copper nanocluster (CuNC) assemblies with multicolor fluorescence emission and excellent reversibility were constructed on the basis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission and the solvent effect of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;capped CuNCs. On the basis of these stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent nanoswitches, a fluorescence sensing platform for the identification of organic solvents was designed.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) as a new class of fluorescent materials have attracted a great deal of interest due to their outstanding fluorescence properties. In this work, a variety of organic solvents were used to induce self&#8208;assembly of glutathione&#8208;capped CuNCs (GSH&#8208;CuNCs) to form ordered assemblies with enhanced fluorescence properties. Assemblies with multicolor fluorescence emission were constructed on the basis of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of GSH&#8208;CuNCs and the solvent effect. The fluorescence emission from these GSH&#8208;CuNCs assemblies can also be tuned from yellow to purple by changing the organic solvent. A possible mechanism based on the size of the assemblies and electron transfer was explored to explain the solvent effects on GSH&#8208;CuNCs. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoswitches with excellent reversibility can be controlled by changing the type of organic solvent and the ratio of the organic solvent to the aqueous solution of GSH&#8208;CuNCs. As the CuNCs assemblies exhibit strong, stable, and color&#8208;tunable fluorescence, they were employed as color&#8208;conversion materials for recognizing different organic solvents.

Abstract
This work reports gold&#8208;catalyzed iminations of terminal propargyl alcohols with anthranils or isoxazoles to yield E&#8208;configured &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#8208;1&#8208;als with complete chemoselectivity. These catalytic iminations occur exclusively with C(1)&#8208;nucleophilic additions on terminal alkynes, in contrast to a typical C(2)&#8208;route. For 3,3&#8208;dialkylprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols, a methyl substituent is superior to long alkyl chains as the 1,2&#8208;migration groups toward &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes. For secondary prop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols, phenyl, vinyl, and cyclopropyl substituents are better than hydrogen as the migrating groups, obviating typical gold carbene reactions. DFT calculations have been performed to rationalize the observed C(1)&#8208;regioselectivity and the preferable cyclopropyl migration based on gold carbene pathways.

DFT calculations have been performed to rationalize the observed C(1)&#8208;regioselectivity and the preferable cyclopropyl migration based on gold carbene pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dithienopyrrole Derivatives with Nitronyl Nitroxide Radicals and Their Oxidation to Cationic High&#8208;Spin Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Dithienopyrrole derivatives with phenyl and methylthiothiophenyl connected with phenylnitronylnitroxides were oxidized to their cations forming high spin S=1 molecules.







Abstract
Three 1 N&#8208;phenyl nitronyl nitroxide (NN) 4&#8208;substituted dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) derivatives with R1=4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;, 4H&#8208;, and 4&#8208;methylthiothiophenyl&#8208; (R12DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN, R1=H, Ph and MeSTh) were designed, synthesized and characterized. The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the molecules exhibited two main oxidation peaks, first for radical cation and next for dication formation. The cation and dication formation were also confirmed by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy for Ph2DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN and MeSTh2DTP&#8208;Ph&#8208;NN titrated with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)aminiumhexachloroantimonate (magic blue). In addition, the cation and dication formation were verified by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, the exchange interactions (J/kB) of NN and radical cation were calculated by DFT studies.

      <title>Overcoming Crystallinity Limitations of Aluminium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by Oxalic Acid Modulated Synthesis
</title>
      <dc:description>
The chelation of aluminium ions by oxalic acid enables a versatile modulation action, drastically increasing crystal size without undesired framework modifications.







Abstract
A modulated synthesis approach based on the chelating properties of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) is presented as a robust and versatile method to achieve highly crystalline Al&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. A comparative study on this method and the already established modulation by hydrofluoric acid was conducted using MIL&#8208;53 as test system. The superior performance of oxalic acid modulation in terms of crystallinity and absence of undesired impurities is explained by assessing the coordination modes of the two modulators and the structural features of the product. The validity of our approach was confirmed for a diverse set of Al&#8208;MOFs, namely X&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 (X=OH, CH3O, Br, NO2), CAU&#8208;10, MIL&#8208;69, and Al(OH)ndc (ndc=1,4&#8208;naphtalenedicarboxylate), highlighting the potential benefits of extending the use of this modulator to other coordination materials.

      <title>A Comparative Study on the Thermodynamics of Halogen Bonding of Group&#8197;10 Pincer Fluoride Complexes</title>

Pincer complexes studied: Group&#8197;10 POCOP (&#954;3&#8208;C6HR2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OPtBu2)2; R=H, tBu) fluoride complexes show pronounced halogen bonding with iodopentafluorobenzene in toluene. Along an isostructural series of complexes, Pd fluorides show the strongest interactions.







Abstract
The thermodynamics of halogen bonding of a series of isostructural Group&#8197;10 metal pincer fluoride complexes of the type [(3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu)MF] (3,5&#8208;R2&#8208;tBuPOCOPtBu=&#954;3&#8208;C6HR2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OPtBu2)2 with R=H, tBu, COOMe; M=Ni, Pd, Pt) and iodopentafluorobenzene was investigated. Based on NMR experiments at different temperatures, all complexes&#8197;1&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Ni), 2&#8208;H (R=H, M=Pd), 2&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pd), 2&#8208;COOMe (R=COOMe, M=Pd) and 3&#8208;tBu (R=tBu, M=Pt) form strong halogen bonds with Pd complexes showing significantly stronger binding to iodopentafluorobenzene. Structural and computational analysis of a model adduct of complex&#8197;2&#8208;tBu with 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene as well as of structures of iodopentafluorobenzene in toluene solution shows that formation of a type&#8197;I contact occurs.

      <title>Barium&#8208;Catalysed Dehydrocoupling of Hydrosilanes and Borinic Acids: A Mechanistic Insight</title>
      <dc:description>
When barium and boron meet: The mechanism of the barium&#8208;mediated dehydrocoupling of borinic acids and hydrosilanes, yielding borasiloxanes in a controlled fashion, has been established by combined experimental and computational investigations.







Abstract
Two very rare cases of barium boryloxides, the homoleptic [Ba(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)2&#8901;C7H8] and the heteroleptic [{LONO4}BaOB{CH(SiMe3)2}2] stabilised by the multidentate aminoetherphenolate {LONO4}&#8722;, are presented, and their structural properties are discussed. The electron&#8208;deficient [Ba(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)2&#8901;C7H8] shows, in particular, resilient &#951;6&#8208;coordination of the toluene molecule. Together with its amido parents [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2&#8901;thf2] and [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2]2, this complex catalyses the fast and chemoselective dehydrocoupling of borinic acids R2BOH and hydrosilanes HSiR&#8242;3, yielding borasiloxanes R2BOSiR&#8242;3 in a controlled fashion. The assessment of substrate scope indicates that, for now, the reaction is limited to bulky borinic acids. Kinetic analysis shows that the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic manifold traverses a dinuclear transition state. A detailed mechanistic scenario is proposed on the basis of DFT computations, the results of which are fully consistent with experimental data. It consists of a stepwise process with rate&#8208;determining nucleophilic attack of a metal&#8208;bound O&#8208;atom onto the incoming hydrosilane, involving throughout dinuclear catalytically active species.

Abstract
The synthesis of a new triaminoguanidinium&#8208;based ligand with three tris&#8208;chelating [NNO]&#8208;binding pockets and C3 symmetry is described. The reaction of tris&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylene&#8208;N&#8208;oxide)triaminoguanidinium salts with zinc(II) formate leads to the formation of cyclic supramolecular coordination compounds which in solution bind fullerenes in their spherical cavities. The rapid encapsulation of C60 can be observed by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is verified using computation.

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity to Local Dynamics in Peptides by Use of Temperature&#8208;Jump IR Spectroscopy and Isotope Labeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced sensitivity: Site&#8208;selected dynamics of a three&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide are probed by laser&#8208;excited temperature&#8208;jump infrared spectroscopy and isotopic labeling. Relaxation time constants show an enhanced sensitivity to vibrational coupling.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific isotopic labeling of molecules is a widely used approach in IR spectroscopy to resolve local contributions to vibrational modes. The induced frequency shift of the corresponding IR band depends on the substituted masses, as well as on hydrogen bonding and vibrational coupling. The impact of these different factors was analyzed with a designed three&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide and by use of selected 13C isotope substitutions at multiple positions in the peptide backbone. Single&#8208;strand labels give rise to isotopically shifted bands at different frequencies, depending on the specific sites; this demonstrates sensitivity to the local environment. Cross&#8208;strand double&#8208; and triple&#8208;labeled peptides exhibited two resolved bands that could be uniquely assigned to specific residues, the equilibrium IR spectra of which indicated only weak local&#8208;mode coupling. Temperature&#8208;jump IR laser spectroscopy was applied to monitor structural dynamics and revealed an impressive enhancement of the isotope sensitivity to both local positions and coupling between them, relative to that of equilibrium FTIR spectroscopy. Site&#8208;specific relaxation rates were altered upon the introduction of additional cross&#8208;strand isotopes. Likewise, the rates for the global &#946;&#8208;sheet dynamics were affected in a manner dependent on the distinct relaxation behavior of the labeled oscillator. This study reveals that isotope labels provide not only local structural probes, but rather sense the dynamic complexity of the molecular environment.

Glutathione&#8208;capped CuNCs (GSH&#8208;CuNCs) were used in this work to form fluorescent assemblies. This simple approach occurs by introducing organic solvents. Multicolor fluorescence emission assemblies with excellent reversibility were constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission and the solvent effect of GSH&#8208;CuNCs. A possible mechanism, which is based on the size of assemblies and electron transfer, was explored to explain the solvent effects of GSH&#8208;CuNCs. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoswitches with excellent reversibility can be controlled by changing the types of organic solvents and the ratio of organic solvent to GSH&#8208;CuNCs aqueous solution. As the CuNCs assemblies exhibit strong, stable, and color&#8208;tunable fluorescence, they are employed as the color conversion materials for recognizing different organic solvents.

      <dc:description>
Isomeric dithieno[b,f]phosphepines (DTPs) have been synthesized and their electronic and structural properties were investigated by experimental (UV/Vis, CV, X&#8208;ray) and theoretical (DFT) techniques. A significant dependency of the molecular properties on the isomerically different ring fusions was revealed, which could be ascribed to different conjugation pathways within the DTPs. Moreover, a synthetic method for the &#960;&#8208;expansion of DTPs via direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling was found, which renders these compounds promising candidates for the development of novel organophosphorus functional materials.

      <title>Front Cover: Barium&#8208;Catalysed Dehydrocoupling of Hydrosilanes and Borinic Acids: A Mechanistic Insight (Chem. Eur. J. 16/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The mechanism of the barium&#8208;catalysed dehydrocoupling between borinic acids R2BOH and hydrosilanes HSiR&#8217;3 that generate borasiloxanes R2BO&#8208;SiR&#8217;3 has been elucidated by teams at ISCR Rennes (France) and KAUST (Saudi Arabia) upon combination of experimental and computational data. The analysis shows that these chemoselective reactions are mediated by dinuclear catalytically active barium&#8208;boryloxide species, regardless of the actual nuclearity of the precatalyst, monomeric as in [Ba(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)2], or dimeric as in [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2]2 and [Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2]2.

      <title>The Structural Basis for Processing of Unnatural Base Pairs by DNA Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding or rather more hydrophobic? Two different pairing concepts are the basis for the currently most promising unnatural base pair (UBP) candidates. This review mainly focusses on structural studies investigating UBP pairings in free duplex DNA or the active site of KlenTaq DNA polymerase, but also highlights the general mechanisms for the acceptance of these unnatural substrates by DNA polymerases.







Abstract
Unnatural base pairs (UBPs) greatly increase the diversity of DNA and RNA, furthering their broad range of molecular biological and biotechnological approaches. Different candidates have been developed whereby alternative hydrogen&#8208;bonding patterns and hydrophobic and packing interactions have turned out to be the most promising base&#8208;pairing concepts to date. The key in many applications is the highly efficient and selective acceptance of artificial base pairs by DNA polymerases, which enables amplification of the modified DNA. In this Review, computational as well as experimental studies that were performed to characterize the pairing behavior of UBPs in free duplex DNA or bound to the active site of KlenTaq DNA polymerase are highlighted. The structural studies, on the one hand, elucidate how base pairs lacking hydrogen bonds are accepted by these enzymes and, on the other hand, highlight the influence of one or several consecutive UBPs on the structure of a DNA double helix. Understanding these concepts facilitates optimization of future UBPs for the manifold fields of applications.

      <title>Molecularly Mixed Composite Membranes: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Microporous molecules have the potential to enable pseudo &#8220;solid solution&#8221; molecularly mixed composite membranes that have improved performance over pure polymer counterparts (see figure).







Abstract
The fabrication of porous molecules, such as metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs), porous organic cages (POCs) and others, has given rise to the potential for creating &#8220;solid solutions&#8221; of molecular fillers and polymers. Such solid solutions circumvent longstanding interface issues associated with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), and are referred to as molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) to distinguish them from traditional two&#8208;phase MMMs. Early investigations of MMCMs highlight the advantages of solid solutions over MMMs, including dispersion of the filler, anti&#8208;plasticization of the polymer network, and removal of deleterious interfacial issues. However, the exact microscopic structure as well as the transport modality in this new class of membrane are not well understood. Moreover, there are clear engineering challenges that need to be addressed for MMCMs to transition into the field. In this Minireview, the authors outline several scientific and technological challenges associated with the aforementioned questions and their suggestions to tackle them.

      <title>Long&#8208;Range Chiral Induction by a Fully Noncovalent Approach in Supramolecular Porphyrin&#8211;Calixarene Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly in water of anionic porphyrins MnTPPS and CuTPPS with cationic bis&#8208;calix[4]arenes BC4 leads to discrete multi&#8208;metalloporphyrin/calixarene assemblies. The chirality of the entire assembly can be easily tuned by adding the chiral calix[4]arene C4 at the periphery of the assembly, thus demonstrating a long&#8208;range chiral transfer process.







Abstract
The hierarchical assembly, in aqueous solution, of a new multi&#8208;metalloporphyrin/calixarene aggregate has been accomplished. In this supramolecular system transfer of chirality, from the outermost components to the central porphyrin reporter, takes place as a result of favorable and fully noncovalent long&#8208;range electronic communication.

Let there be light: C&#8722;H arylations were realized at room temperature with a hybrid copper catalyst, enabling catalyst recycling and reuse.







Abstract
Heterogeneous copper catalysis enabled photoinduced C&#8722;H arylations under exceedingly mild conditions at room temperature. The versatile hybrid copper catalyst provided step&#8208;economical access to arylated heteroarenes, terpenes and alkaloid natural products with various aryl halides. The hybrid copper catalyst could be reused without significant loss of catalytic efficacy. Detailed studies in terms of TEM, HRTEM and XPS analysis of the hybrid copper catalyst, among others, supported its outstanding stability and reusability.

      <title>Multilayered 2D Cesium&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite with Strong Polarization Sensitivity: Dimensional Reduction of CsPbBr3</title>
      <dc:description>
Dimensional reduction of CsPbBr3 results in the highly anisotropic internal motif and optical absorption of a newly tailored 2D Cs&#8208;based halide perovskite, which enables excellent linearly polarized photodetection behaviors with remarkable dichroic ratio (Ipc/Ipa&#8776;2.1). This structure (see figure) provides a promising opportunity for exploring new polarized&#8208;sensitive photodetectors.







Abstract
3D perovskite CsPbBr3 has recently taken a blooming position for optoelectronic applications. However, due to the lack of natural anisotropy of optical attributes, it is a great challenge to fulfil polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection. Here, for the first time, we exploited dimensionality reduction of CsPbBr3 to tailor a 2D&#8208;multilayered hybrid perovskite, (TRA)2CsPb2Br7 (1, in which TRA is (carboxy)cyclohexylmethylammonium), serving as a potential polarized&#8208;light detecting candidate. Its unique quantum&#8208;confined 2D structure results in intrinsic anisotropy of electrical conductivity, optical absorbance, and polarization&#8208;dependent responses. Particularly, it exhibits remarkable dichroism with the photocurrent ratio (Ipc/Ipa) of &#8776;2.1, being much higher than that of the isotropic CsPbBr3 crystal and reported CH3NH3PbI3 nanowire (&#8776;1.3), which reveals its great potentials for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection. Further, crystal&#8208;based detectors of 1 show fascinating responses to the polarized light, including high detectivity (&gt;1010 Jones), fast responding time (&#8776;300&#8197;&#956;s), and sizeable on/off current ratios (&gt;104). To our best knowledge, this is the first study on 2D Cs&#8208;based hybrid perovskite exhibiting strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity. The work highlights an effective pathway to explore new polarization sensitive candidates for hybrid perovskites and promotes their future electronic applications.

      <title>Intrinsic Turn&#8208;On Response of Thioflavin&#8197;T in Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorescence turn&#8208;on responses were found when amyloid&#8208;sensing dye thioflavin T binds to a derivatized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in both gaseous and solvated forms, but several other solution&#8208;active turn&#8208;on reporters did not turn on gas&#8208;phase fluorescence. The contrast sheds light on key interactions between chromophore, host and solvent in an important fluorescent probe.







Abstract
The fluorescence enhancement (&#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;) response of the amyloid&#8208;sensing dye thioflavin&#8197;T (ThT) is examined in vacuo, where solvent interactions are absent. Upon the complexation of ThT with a derivatized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, heptakis&#8208;[6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;6&#8208;(3&#8208;sulfanylpropanoic acid)]&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, turn&#8208;on responses in both the gas phase and solution phase were observed. In contrast, turn&#8208;on response was not detected when ThT was bound to gaseous cucurbit[7]uril or human telomeric DNA 22AG, whereas clear turn&#8208;on response occurs in solution. The observed difference in turn&#8208;on response in the gas phase emphasizes the key interplay between chromophore, host and solvent and demonstrates the utility of gas&#8208;phase spectroscopy to tease out the balance among intermolecular forces driving the behavior of important chromophores in solution.

      <title>Highly Enantioselective, Organocatalytic, and Scalable Synthesis of a Rare cis,cis&#8208;Tricyclic Diterpenoid</title>
      <dc:description>
Organocatalysis: The highly enantioselective synthesis of a tricyclic terpenoid system is described with a remarkable cis,cis&#8208;configuration of the fused decalin and hydrindane systems. This intriguing selectivity is thought to be due to the nitro group dictating the transition state of the cyclization adopted (see scheme).







Abstract
A highly enantioselective, organocatalytic, and scalable synthesis of a very unusual cis&#8208;decalin&#8208;cis&#8208;hydrindane tricyclic diterpenoid system has been achieved. Despite the prevalent pharmacological space that the related trans,trans and trans,cis&#8208;systems occupy, there have been no reports of an asymmetric synthesis of the cis,cis systems in the literature until now. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach not only through access to a diverse range of products, all of which are attained in exceptionally high selectivities, but also by showing their easy conversion to the corresponding trans,cis&#8208;system and other derivatives.

      <title>Rational Design of a Cocktail of Inhibitors against A&#946; Aggregation</title>
      <dc:description>
A cocktail of several inhibitors which could bind with different species of A&#946; aggregates simultaneously and achieve co&#8208;inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, without any unwanted interference observed.







Abstract
It has been reported that many molecules could inhibit the aggregation of A&#946; (amyloid&#8208;&#946;) through suppressing either primary nucleation, secondary nucleation, or elongation processes. In order to suppress multiple pathways of A&#946; aggregation, we screened 23 small molecules and found two types of inhibitors with different inhibiting mechanisms based on chemical kinetics analysis. Trp&#8208;glucose conjugates (AS2) could bind with fibril ends while natural products (D3 and D4) could associate with monomers. A cocktail of these two kinds of molecules achieved co&#8208;inhibition of various fibrillar species and avoid unwanted interference.

Not just a [4+2] cycloaddition!

Abstract
While artificial cyclases hold great promise in chemical synthesis, this work presents the first example of a DNA&#8208;catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDHDA) between dihydrofuran and various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl imidazoles. The resulting fused bicyclic O,O&#8208;acetals containing three contiguous stereogenic centers are obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;99:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee) using a low catalyst loading. Most importantly, these results show that the concept of DNA&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis can be expanded to new synthetic transformations offering an efficient, sustainable, and highly selective tool for the construction of chiral building blocks.

The resulting fused bicyclic &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetals containing three contiguous stereogenic centers can be obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivities (up to &amp;gt;99:1 dr and up to 95&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) using a low catalyst loading.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While artificial cyclases hold great promise in chemical synthesis, this work presents the first example of a DNA&#8208;catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDHDA) between dihydrofuran and various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl imidazoles. The resulting fused bicyclic &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetals containing three contiguous stereogenic centers are obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; (up to &amp;gt;99:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) using a low catalyst loading. Most importantly, these results show that the concept of DNA&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis can be expanded to new synthetic transformations offering an efficient, sustainable, and highly selective tool for the construction of chiral building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bifunctional RNA&#8208;Targeting Deoxyribozyme Nanodevice as a Potential Theranostic Agent</title>
      <dc:description>
Two birds with one stone: A DNA association can complete both RNA&#8208;cleaving (therapeutic) and RNA&#8208;detecting (diagnostic) functions.







Abstract
Theranostic approaches rely on simultaneous diagnostic of a disease and its therapy. Here, we designed a DNA nanodevice, which can simultaneously report the presence of a specific RNA target through an increase in fluorescence and cleave it. High selectivity of RNA target recognition under near physiological conditions was achieved. The proposed approach can become a basis for the design of DNA nanomachines and robots for diagnostics and therapy of viral infections, cancer, and genetic disorders.

Hantzsch ester as a photocatalyst: Diethyl 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (HEH) has been utilized as a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst for the coupling of arylsulfinates and arylhalides without transition metal, external oxidant, sacrificial agent, and mediator.







Abstract
Diethyl 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (HEH) has been utilized as a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst for the cross coupling of arylhalides and arylsulfinates without transition metal, sacrificial agent, and mediator. This method is compatible with various functional groups and provides diaryl sulfones in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction undergoes the stepwise light irradiation of HE&#8722;, single electron transfer (SET) in donor&#8211;acceptor complex (DAC) from *HE&#8722; to arylhalide, trapping of aryl radical with sulfinate, and SET oxidation of sulfone radical anion by HE. to sulfone by the DAC method.

      <title>Isomeric Dithienophosphepines: The Impact of Ring Fusion on Electronic and Structural Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Similar yet different: A series of isomeric thiophene&#8208;fused phosphepines has been synthesized and the impact of different ring fusions on structural, photophysical, and redox properties in parent as well as &#960;&#8208;expanded derivatives has been studied.







Abstract
The synthesis and extensive experimental (X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry) and theoretical (DFT calculations) characterization of two isomeric dithieno[b,f]phosphepines (DTPs) are presented herein. The relative orientation of the phosphepine and the thiophene moieties has a decisive impact on the electronic and structural properties of these compounds. Moreover, the thiophene units allow for a facile subsequent functionalization through direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling, which renders DTPs highly promising building blocks for organophosphorus functional materials.

Abstract
Phosphorene, generally defined as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) with monolayered or few&#8208;layered structure, has emerged as a promising member of the family of 2D materials. Since its discovery in 2014, extensive research has been focused on broadening its applications, covering the biological, photoelectric, and electrochemical fields, owing to the unique physicochemical and structural properties. As a single&#8208;elemental material, phosphorene has demonstrated its applicability for the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and other electrocatalytic applications. In this Minireview, a summary of the very recent research progresses of phosphorene in electrocatalysis is offered, with a special focus on the effective synthetic strategies towards performance improvement. In the concluding section, challenges and perspectives are also discussed.
