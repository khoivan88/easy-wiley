      <title>Tandem Catalysis of Ammonia Borane Dehydrogenation and Phenylacetylene Hydrogenation Catalyzed by CeO2 Nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
      <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis. A CeO2 nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al) sandwich&#8208;structured catalyst has been used as a tandem catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (see figure). This work provides an alternative strategy for balancing the conversion and selectivity of liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed, selective hydrogenation in the liquid phase is widely used in industry for the synthesis of chemicals. However, it can be a challenge to prevent active nanoparticles (e.g., palladium) from aggregation/leaching and meanwhile achieve high conversion as well as selectivity, especially under mild conditions. To address these issues, a CeO2 nanotube/Pd@MIL&#8208;53(Al) sandwich&#8208;structured catalyst has been prepared in which the MIL&#8208;53(Al) porous shell can efficiently stabilize the palladium nanoparticles. When this catalyst was used in a tandem catalytic reaction involving the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, remarkably, the hydrogen released from the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane boosted the catalytic process, with 100&#8201;% conversion of phenylacetylene and a selectivity of 96.2&#8201;% for styrene, even at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, within 1&#8197;min. This work therefore provides an alternative strategy for balancing the conversion and selectivity of liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions.

      <title>Ligand Taxonomy for Bioinorganic Modeling of Dioxygen&#8208;Activating Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Designer ligands for biomimetic chemistry: A judicious combination of donor atoms, ligand denticity, and backbone topology dictates the stereochemistry and reactivity of iron complexes to mimic non&#8208;heme enzymes, which reductively activate dioxygen to catalyze oxidative transformations of organic molecules.







Abstract
Novel functions emerge from novel structures. To develop efficient catalytic systems for challenging chemical transformations, chemists often seek inspirations from enzymatic catalysis. A large number of iron complexes supported by nitrogen&#8208;rich multidentate ligands have thus been developed to mimic oxo&#8208;transfer reactivity of dioxygen&#8208;activating metalloenzymes. Such efforts have significantly advanced our understanding of the reaction mechanisms by trapping key intermediates and elucidating their geometric and electronic properties. Critical to the success of this biomimetic approach is the design and synthesis of elaborate ligand systems to balance the thermodynamic stability, structural adaptability, and chemical reactivity. In this Concept article, representative design strategies for biomimetic atom&#8208;transfer chemistry are discussed from the perspectives of &#8220;ligand builders&#8221;. Emphasis is placed on how the primary coordination sphere is constructed, and how it can be elaborated further by rational design for desired functions.

      <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;up Bioorthogonal Probes for In Vivo Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Light it up! A new class of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;based light&#8208;up bioorthogonal probes with tunable colors was developed. In bioimaging experiments, these versatile probes were successfully used for live&#8208;cell imaging without washing steps, as well as in vivo two&#8208;photon (TP) imaging of live zebrafish and mice, in which they showed better resolution and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for in vivo tumor imaging than conventional fluorophores without light&#8208;up property.







Abstract
Light&#8208;up bioorthogonal probes have attracted increasing attention recently due to their capability to directly image diverse biomolecules in living cells without washing steps. The development of bioorthogonal probes with excellent fluorescent properties suitable for in vivo imaging, such as long excitation/emission wavelength, high fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratio, and deep penetration, has been rarely reported. Herein, a series of azide&#8208;based light&#8208;up bioorthogonal probes with tunable colors based on a weak fluorescent 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) scaffold were designed and synthesized. The azido quinoline derivatives are able to induce large fluorescence enhancement (up to 1352&#8208;fold) after click reaction with alkynes. In addition, the probes could be engineered to exhibit excellent two&#8208;photon properties (&#948;=542&#8197;GM at 780&#8197;nm) after further introducing different styryl groups into the AQ scaffold. Subsequent detailed bioimaging experiments demonstrated that these versatile probes can be successfully used for live cell/zebrafish imaging without washing steps. Further in vivo two&#8208;photon imaging experiments demonstrated that these light&#8208;up biorthogonal probe outperformed conventional fluorophores, for example, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and deep tissue penetration. The design strategy reported in this study is a useful approach to realize diverse high&#8208;performance biorthogonal light&#8208;up probes for in vivo studying.

      <title>First principle investigation of &#946;&#8208;FeOOH for hydrogen evolution: Identifying reactive sites and boosting surficial reaction</title>

Nevertheless, the insightful understanding of surficial reaction between water and &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, in particular hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is still insufficient.

Sequential H&#8208;atom abstraction reactions ensue.&#160;The first H&#8208;atom abstraction leads to intensely colored aminium radical cations, Ar  2  NH&#8729;  +  , some of which are quite stable.&#160;However, most undergo a second H&#8208;atom abstraction leading to ammonium ions, Ar  2  NH  2  +  . In the absence of a ready source of H&#8208;atoms, a unique self&#8208;abstraction reaction occurs when Ar=Me  5  C  6  , leading to a novel iminium radical cation, Ar=N&#8729;  +  Ar, which decays via a second self H&#8208;atom abstraction reaction to give a stable iminium ion, Ar=N  +  HAr. These products differ substantially from those derived via photochemically&#8208;produced diarylnitrenium ions.</dc:description>

      <title>Experimental and quantum mechanical characterization of an oxygen&#8208;bridged plutonium(IV) dimer</title>
      <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of K  4  {[PuCl  2  (NO  3  )  3  ]  2  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)}&#183;H  2  O, which contains the first known &#956;  2  &#8208;oxo bridge between two Pu  IV  metal centers. Adding to its uniqueness is the Pu&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O) bond length of 2.04 &#197;, which is the shortest of other analogous compounds. The Pu&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O)&#8208;Pu bridge is characterized by the mixing of  s  &#8208;,  d  &#8208;, and  p  &#8208;orbitals from Pu with the  p  &#8208;orbitals of O; the 5  f  &#8208;orbitals do not participate in bonding. Natural bond orbital analysis indicates that Pu and O interact through one 3c&#8208;2e &#963;  Pu&#8208;O&#8208;Pu  and two 3c&#8208;2e &#960;  Pu&#8208;O&#8208;Pu  bonding orbitals and that the electron density is highly polarized on the &#956;  2  &#8208;O. Bond topology properties analysis indicates that the Pu&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O) bond shares both ionic and covalent character. Quantum mechanical calculations also show that the dimer has multiconfigurational ground states, where the nonet, septet, quintet, triplet, and singlet are close in energy. This work demonstrates the interplay between experimental and computational efforts that is required to understand the chemical bonding of Pu compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>A Synthetic Chlorophyll Dimer Appending Fullerene: Effect of Chlorophyll Pairing on (Photo)redox Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Accurately mimicking structure and function of natural chlorophyll (Chl) assemblies is very challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of a fullerene&#8208;appended Chl dimer being capable of intramolecular photoinduced charge separation (CS) with a unique structure reminiscent of reaction centers (RCs) in phototrophs. Structural analyses revealed that the Chl dimer adopts a bird&#8208;like structure in which two Chl components overlapped partially with one of the four pyrrole rings in a Chl ring similar to in a Chl pair in the natural RC complexes. A comparative study including voltammetry and spectrometric analyses using the Chl dimer and its corresponding monomer with and without a fullerene moiety was performed to gain insight into the effect of Chl pairing on (photo)redox properties. Our results suggest that the present dimer motif that closely resemble the Chl pair in natural RCs lead to more facile oxidation and lower energy of the CS state of the Chl dimer than those of the Chl monomer, resulting in its photoredox behavior different from that of the monomer Chl.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Perturbation of Oncogenic Protein Folding: from the Prediction of Locally Unstable Structures to the Design of Disruptors of Hsp90&#8208;Client Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Protein folding quality control in cells requires the activity of a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones. Heat shock protein&#8208;90 (Hsp90), a multidomain ATP driven molecular machine, is a prime representative of this family of proteins. Interactions between Hsp90, its co&#8208;chaperones, and client proteins have been shown to be important in facilitating the correct folding and activation of clients. Hsp90 levels and functions are elevated in tumor cells. Here, we computationally predict the regions on the native structures of clients c&#8208;Abl, c&#8208;Src, Cdk4, B&#8208;Raf and Glucocorticoid Receptor, that have the highest probability of undergoing local unfolding, despite being ordered in their native structures. Such regions represent potential ideal interaction points with the Hsp90&#8208;system. We synthesize mimics spanning these regions and confirm their interaction with partners of the Hsp90 complex (Hsp90, Cdc37 and Aha1) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Designed mimics selectively disrupt the association of their respective clients with the Hsp90 machinery, leaving unrelated clients unperturbed and causing apoptosis in cancer cells. Overall, selective targeting of Hsp90 protein&#8208;protein interactions is achieved without causing indiscriminate degradation of all clients, setting the stage for the development of therapeutics based on specific chaperone:client perturbation</dc:description>

      <title>Isoleucine residues determine chiral discrimination of odorant&#8208;binding protein</title>
      <dc:description>Enzymes, receptors and carrier proteins discriminate between enantiomers of natural and synthetic chemicals. While the structural details of this phenomenon have been investigated in enzymes and receptors, much less is known for carrier proteins of hydrophobic ligands, particularly concerning the contribution of asymmetric centres in the side chains of amino acids to chirally selective binding. Working with a pig odorant&#8208;binding protein, we have found that the replacement of either one or both isoleucine residues in the binding pocket by leucines abolishes discrimination of menthol and carvone enantiomers. The results indicate that isoleucines are crucial for chiral discrimination of hydrophobic ligands, and that asymmetry in the side chain may be as important as the overall asymmetry of the protein. The results provide suggestions and guidelines for improving chiral selectivity of binding proteins and enzymes, with consequent applications in the production of enantiomerically pure drugs.</dc:description>

The newly synthesized compounds showed strong binding and selectivity to AAAGTTT compared to similar sequences AAATTT and AAAGCTTT, and were investigated by biosensor&#8208;SPR, fluorescence spectroscopy, DNA thermal melting, ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics.







Abstract
A series of small diamidines with thiophene and modified N&#8208;alkylbenzimidazole &#963;&#8208;hole module represent specific binding to single G&#8901;C base pair (bp) DNA sequence. The variation of N&#8208;alkyl or aromatic rings were sensitive to microstructures of the DNA minor groove. Thirteen new compounds were synthesized to test their binding affinity and selectivity. The dicyanobenzimidazoles needed to synthesize the target diamidines were made via condensation/cyclization reactions of different aldehydes with different 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(alkyl&#8208; or phenyl&#8208;amino) benzonitriles. The final diamidines were synthesized using lithium bis&#8208;trimethylsilylamide (LiN[Si(CH3)3]2) or Pinner methods. The newly synthesized compounds showed strong binding and selectivity to AAAGTTT compared to similar sequences AAATTT and AAAGCTTT investigated by several biophysical methods including biosensor&#8208;SPR, fluorescence spectroscopy, DNA thermal melting, ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics. The binding affinity results determined by fluorescence spectroscopy are in accordance with those obtained by biosensor&#8208;SPR. These small size single G&#8901;C bp highly specific binders extend the compound database for future biological applications.

      <title>Pressure Sensitivity of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 Condensates as a Model for Postsynaptic Densities and its Biophysical and Neurological Ramifications</title>
      <dc:description>
High pressure sensitivity of postsynaptic densities: Quite unexpectedly, a binary protein condensate mimicking postsynaptic densities, which are protein assemblies underneath the plasma membrane of excitatory synapses, reveals high pressure sensitivity, which may shed light on the biophysical underpinnings of pressure&#8208;related neurological disorders.







Abstract
Biomolecular condensates consisting of proteins and nucleic acids can serve critical biological functions, so that some condensates are referred as membraneless organelles. They can also be disease&#8208;causing, if their assembly is misregulated. A major physicochemical basis of the formation of biomolecular condensates is liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS). In general, LLPS depends on environmental variables, such as temperature and hydrostatic pressure. The effects of pressure on the LLPS of a binary SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 protein system mimicking postsynaptic densities, which are protein assemblies underneath the plasma membrane of excitatory synapses, were investigated. Quite unexpectedly, the model system LLPS is much more sensitive to pressure than the folded states of typical globular proteins. Phase&#8208;separated droplets of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 were found to dissolve into a homogeneous solution already at ten&#8208;to&#8208;hundred bar levels. The pressure sensitivity of SynGAP/PSD&#8208;95 is seen here as a consequence of both pressure&#8208;dependent multivalent interaction strength and void volume effects. Considering that organisms in the deep sea are under pressures up to about 1&#8197;kbar, this implies that deep&#8208;sea organisms have to devise means to counteract this high pressure sensitivity of biomolecular condensates to avoid harm. Intriguingly, these findings may shed light on the biophysical underpinning of pressure&#8208;related neurological disorders in terrestrial vertebrates.

      <title>BODIPYs as Chemically Stable Fluorescent Tags for Synthetic Glycosylation Strategies towards Fluorescently Labeled Saccharides</title>
      <dc:description>
A colorful solution: Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorophores, conveniently substituted, can endure most of the reaction conditions involved in synthetic sequences leading to oligosaccharides. Thus, BODIPY dyes could be used as aglycons in synthetic routes leading to fluorescently labeled saccharides. Accordingly, BODIPYs display a dual role: as colorful glycosyl&#8208;tags during the synthesis, and as fluorescent&#8208;labels on the ensuing glycosides.







Abstract
A series of fluorescent boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY, 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) dyes have been designed to participate, as aglycons, in synthetic oligosaccharide protocols. As such, they served a dual purpose: first, by being incorporated at the beginning of the process (at the reducing&#8208;end of the growing saccharide moiety), they can function as fluorescent glycosyl tags, facilitating the detection and purification of the desired glycosidic intermediates, and secondly, the presence of these chromophores on the ensuing compounds grants access to fluorescently labeled saccharides. In this context, a sought&#8208;after feature of the fluorescent dyes has been their chemical robustness. Accordingly, some BODIPY derivatives described in this work can withstand the reaction conditions commonly employed in the chemical synthesis of saccharides; namely, glycosylation and protecting&#8208;group manipulations. Regarding their photophysical properties, the BODIPY&#8208;labeled saccharides obtained in this work display remarkable fluorescence efficiency in water, reaching quantum yield values up to 82&#8201;%, as well as notable lasing efficiencies and photostabilities.

      <title>Co&#8208;hydrolysis and Seed&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Basic Mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites with Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Seed&#8208;induced synthesis: Basic mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 with adjustable alkaline&#8208;earth metal species have been synthesized by an acid co&#8208;hydrolysis and seed&#8208;induced method. Its mesostructure together with the high dispersity of basic guest species was realized by this non&#8208;classical crystallization process.







Abstract
For zeolite catalysts, the regulation of active site and pore structure plays an important role in the enhancement of their catalytic performance. In this work, a one&#8208;pot and organic template&#8208;free co&#8208;regulation route is proposed to straightforwardly synthesize basic mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with adjustable alkaline&#8208;earth metal species. The synthesis pathway combines two decisive strategies: 1)&#8197;the seed&#8208;induced interface assembly growth method and 2)&#8197;the acidic co&#8208;hydrolysis/condensation of aluminosilicate species and alkaline&#8208;earth metal (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) sources. It is interesting that the mesoporous structure was self&#8208;evolved through particle&#8208;attached seed&#8208;interfacial crystallization without the assistance of any template. Meanwhile, the incorporation of alkaline&#8208;earth metals species is homogeneous and highly dispersed in the solid products during the whole crystallization process, and finally generate the superior basicity. Catalysis tests of the as&#8208;synthesized samples displayed their novel performance in the typical base reaction of Knoevenagel condensation, even for bulky substrates owing to the enhanced diffusion arising from the meso/microporous network. This finding opens new possibilities for facile, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly synthesis of mesoporous high&#8208;silica zeolites with tunable acid/base properties, and deepens our understanding of the particle&#8208;attached crystallization.

      <title>An Enantiopure Propeller&#8208;Like Trityl&#8208;Brominated Radical: Bringing Together a High Racemization Barrier and an Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescent Magnetic Emitter</title>
      <dc:description>
Get radical! An efficient circularly polarized luminescence emitter, based on a persistent trityl radical substituted with bulky bromine atoms at ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, is reported (see figure). In addition, this emitter has a high racemization barrier between its enantiomers.







Abstract
A new persistent organic free radical has been synthetized with Br atoms occupying the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions of a trityl core. After the isolation of its two propeller&#8208;like atropisomers, Plus (P) and minus (M), their absolute configurations were assigned by a combination of theoretical and experimental data. Remarkably, no hints of racemization were observed up to 60&#8201;&#176;C for more than two hours, due to the higher steric hindrance imposed by the bulky Br atoms. Therefore, when compared to its chlorinated homologue (t1/2=18&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C), an outstanding stability against racemization was achieved. A circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response of both enantiomers was detected. This free radical shows a satisfactory luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum(592&#8197;nm)|&#8776;0.7&#215;10&#8722;3) despite its pure organic nature and low luminescence quantum yield (LQY). Improved organic magnetic CPL emitters derived from the reported structure can be envisaged thanks to the wide possibilities that Br atoms at para&#8208;positions offer for further functionalization.

      <title>Live Monitoring of Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide Alkyne Cycloadditions in Complex Reaction Environments by Inline ATR&#8208;IR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking a closer look: We show that azide cycloadditions can be monitored in complex reaction environments by using an inline ATR&#8208;IR probe in a small&#8208;volume reaction flask also facilitating full temperature control. This method enables following bioorthogonal azide cyclooctyne ligations even in biological fluids such as human plasma.







Abstract
The strain&#8208;promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) is a powerful tool for forming covalent bonds between molecules even under physiological conditions, and therefore found broad application in fields ranging from biological chemistry and biomedical research to materials sciences. For many applications, knowledge about reaction kinetics of these ligations is of utmost importance. Kinetics are commonly assessed and studied by NMR measurements. However, these experiments are limited in terms of temperature and restricted to deuterated solvents. By using an inline ATR&#8208;IR probe we show that the cycloaddition of azides and alkynes can be monitored in aqueous and even complex biological fluids enabling the investigation of reaction kinetics in various solvents and even human blood plasma under controlled conditions in low reaction volumes.

      <title>Fluorescent and Biocompatible Ruthenium&#8208;Coordinated Oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) Nanocatalysts for Transfer Hydrogenation in the Mitochondria of Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A multifunctional metal catalyst, ruthenium&#8208;coordinated oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (OPV&#8208;Ru) was developed for intracellular catalysis of a transfer hydrogenation reaction. OPV&#8208;Ru self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles and subsequently works perfectly inside living cells with excellent performance, fluorescent imaging ability, specific mitochondria targeting and good chemoselectivity with high catalysis efficiency (see figure).







Abstract
It is challenging to design metal catalysts for in situ transformation of endogenous biomolecules with good performance inside living cells. Herein, we report a multifunctional metal catalyst, ruthenium&#8208;coordinated oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (OPV&#8208;Ru), for intracellular catalysis of transfer hydrogenation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to its reduced format (NADH). Owing to its amphiphilic characteristic, OPV&#8208;Ru possesses good self&#8208;assembly capability in water to form nanoparticles through hydrophobic interaction and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and numerous positive charges on the surface of nanoparticles displayed a strong electrostatic interaction with negatively charged substrate molecules, creating a local microenvironment for enhancing the catalysis efficiency in comparison to dispersed catalytic center molecule (TOF value was enhanced by about 15&#8197;fold). OPV&#8208;Ru could selectively accumulate in the mitochondria of living cells. Benefiting from its inherent fluorescence, the dynamic distribution in cells and uptake behavior of OPV&#8208;Ru could be visualized under fluorescence microscopy. This work represents the first demonstration of a multifunctional organometallic complex catalyzing natural hydrogenation transformation in specific subcellular compartments of living cells with excellent performance, fluorescent imaging ability, specific mitochondria targeting and good chemoselectivity with high catalysis efficiency.

      <title>Rapid Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of CdS/Graphene/MoSx Tunable Heterojunctions and Their Application in Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
2D/2D graphene/MoSx heterojunctions are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in CdS&#8208;based hybrids for photocatalytic activity enhancement. The rapid microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic protocol requires moderate temperatures. The enhanced photodegradation of nitroarene is attributed to a few advantageous synergetic parameters, such as intimate contacts between the components of the hybrid and the chemical speciation of the nanostructured materials.







Abstract
Nanoscale two&#8208;dimensional nanostructures have shown great potential as functional components in photocatalysis. Here, investigations on the synthesis of heterostructured hybrids, comprised of 0D CdS nanoparticles as semiconductor and 2D/2D graphene/MoSx as co&#8208;catalyst, are reported. The approach involves a rapid microwave&#8208;assisted reaction in autoclave conditions, by adopting either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step protocol. The chemical speciation of the nanocomposites was found to depend strongly on the compounding conditions of the precursor substances. The photocatalytic activity was assessed by monitoring the photodegradation rate of 4&#8208;nitrophenol in solution using simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of the hybrids may be attributed to a combination of beneficial characteristics, strongly related to the chemical speciation of the composite components. Moreover, intimate contacts of the latter result in efficient heterojunctions. Overall, the present study provides valuable insight into the development of functional heterostructured photocatalysts comprised of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.

      <title>&#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbene Intermediates from Readily Accessible Sulfilimines: Intermolecular Access to Structural Diversity</title>
      <dc:description>
Sulfilimines, a new generation nitrene transfer reagent: The concise and scalable methods for preparing differently substituted sulfilimines are discussed. The gold&#8208;catalyzed syntheses of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds from these aza&#8208;sulfur ylides through &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates are summarized.







Abstract
Catalytic approaches to pharmaceutically important bioactive skeletons through gold carbene intermediates have experienced a dramatic development in the last decade. Although various carbene precursors continue to play an important role in heterocyclic syntheses, these reagents are associated with some drawbacks in terms of functional group tolerance, synthetic methods and safety limitations. A new generation of nitrene transfer reagents was established in 2019: the sulfilimines. These are safe, inexpensive and readily available. They can conveniently be stored and handled, and thus represent ideal reagents for the fast and modular modification of scaffolds and the preparation of libraries by intermolecular reactions of two components. Both the practical methods for synthesizing sulfilimines and the versatility of these ylidic species in gold&#8208;catalyzed preparation of structural diversity, for both heterocycles and carbocycles, will be outlined in this Concept article.

     alt="Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbene Intermediates from Readily Accessible Sulfilimines: Intermolecular Access to Structural Diversity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sulfilimines, a new generation nitrene transfer reagent&lt;/b&gt;: The concise and scalable methods for preparing differently substituted sulfilimines are discussed. The gold&#8208;catalyzed syntheses of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds from these aza&#8208;sulfur ylides through &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates are summarized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic approaches to pharmaceutically important bioactive skeletons through gold carbene intermediates have experienced a dramatic development in the last decade. Although various carbene precursors continue to play an important role in heterocyclic syntheses, these reagents are associated with some drawbacks in terms of functional group tolerance, synthetic methods and safety limitations. A new generation of nitrene transfer reagents was established in 2019: the sulfilimines. These are safe, inexpensive and readily available. They can conveniently be stored and handled, and thus represent ideal reagents for the fast and modular modification of scaffolds and the preparation of libraries by intermolecular reactions of two components. Both the practical methods for synthesizing sulfilimines and the versatility of these ylidic species in gold&#8208;catalyzed preparation of structural diversity, for both heterocycles and carbocycles, will be outlined in this Concept article.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influence of the Attachment of a Gold(I) Phosphine Moiety at the Upper Rim of a Calix[4]pyrrole on the Binding of Tetraalkylammonium Chloride Salts</title>
      <dc:description>
Building a &#8220;two&#8208;wall&#8221; calix[4]pyrrole: The synthesis and binding studies of an unprecedented organometallic &#8220;two&#8208;wall&#8221; calix[4]pyrrole bearing one gold(I) phosphine residue at the upper rim is reported. The increase in the negative value of the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) at the center of the substituted aromatic wall produces stronger repulsive chloride&#8208;&#960; interactions in the resulting complexes compared to the parent ligand.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of an unprecedented mono&#8208;gold(I) phosphine complex based on a &#8220;two&#8208;wall&#8221; aryl&#8208;ethynyl extended calix[4]pyrrole. We describe and compare the binding properties of the parent 10&#945;,20&#945;&#8208;bis&#8208;aryl&#8208;ethynyl calix[4]pyrrole ligand and the prepared organometallic compound as receptors for tetraalkylammonium chloride salts in dichloromethane and acetone. We describe the results of 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments in dichloromethane and acetone, aiming to thermodynamically characterize the formed complexes. The obtained results indicate a noticeable decrease in the binding affinity of the chloride for the mono&#8208;gold(I) receptor 1 compared to the parent ligand 2. The increase in the negative value of the electrostatic surface potential at the center of the aromatic ring of the gold(I) meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;ethynyl substituent serves to explain the observed results and the presence in solution of the chloride complex of 1 as a mixture of two conformers.

      <title>In Situ Structural Determination of a Homogeneous Ruthenium Racemization Catalyst and Its Activated Intermediates Using X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Resolved in situ! The activation process of a known Ru&#8208;catalyst, dicarbonyl(pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium chloride, is studied in detail using time resolved in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The data provide bond lengths of the species involved in the process such as the acyl type key intermediate as well as information about bond formation and bond breaking during the activation process.







Abstract
The activation process of a known Ru&#8208;catalyst, dicarbonyl(pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium chloride, has been studied in detail using time resolved in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The data provide bond lengths of the species involved in the process as well as information about bond formation and bond breaking. On addition of potassium tert&#8208;butoxide, the catalyst is activated and an alkoxide complex is formed. The catalyst activation proceeds via a key acyl intermediate, which gives rise to a complete structural change in the coordination environment around the Ru atom. The rate of activation for the different catalysts was found to be highly dependent on the electronic properties of the cyclopentadienyl ligand. During catalytic racemization of 1&#8208;phenylethanol a fast&#8208;dynamic equilibrium was observed.

      <title>On the Aqueous Chemistry of the UIV&#8211;DOTA Complex
</title>
      <dc:description>
Treading water: The tetravalent uranium ion is unusually stable in complexes with 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrazacyclodecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraacetic acid (DOTA) complex in aqueous solutions. A study of the effect of axial ligand substitution on the electronic and redox properties revealed surprising findings, such as the possible quasi&#8208;reversible UV/UIV process of the chelated ion with the apparent formation of a short&#8208;lived, non&#8208;uranyl, pentavalent UV cation.







Abstract
The 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrazacyclodecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraacetic acid (DOTA) aqueous complex of UIV with H2O, OH&#8722;, and F&#8722; as axial ligands was studied by using UV/Vis spectrophotometry, ESI&#8208;MS, NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and electrochemistry. The UIV&#8211;DOTA complex with either water or fluoride as axial ligands was found to be inert to oxidation by molecular oxygen, whereas the complex with hydroxide as an axial ligand slowly hydrolyzed and was oxidized by dioxygen to a diuranate precipitate. The combined data set acquired shows that, although axial substitution of fluoride and hydroxide ligands instead of water does not seem to significantly change the aqueous DOTA complex structure, it has an important effect on the electronic configuration of the complex. The UIV/UIII redox couple was found to be quasi&#8208;reversible for the complex with both axially bonded H2O and hydroxide, but irreversible for the complex with axially bonded fluoride. Intriguingly, binding of the axial fluoride renders the irreversible one&#8208;electron UV/UIV oxidation of the [UIV(DOTA)(H2O)] complex quasi&#8208;reversible, which suggests the formation of the short&#8208;lived pentavalent form of the complex, an aqueous non&#8208;uranyl chelated UV cation.

      <title>Double Chalcogen Bonds: Crystal Engineering Stratagems via Diffraction and Multinuclear Solid&#8208;State Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal engineering: Dicyanoselenadiazole and dicyanotelluradiazole derivatives work as promising supramolecular synthons with the ability to form double chalcogen bonds with a wide range of electron donors. A a multifaceted experimental and computational study of a large series of novel chalcogen&#8208;bonded cocrystals, prepared using the principles of crystal engineering is presented here.







Abstract
Group&#8197;16 chalcogens potentially provide Lewis&#8208;acidic &#963;&#8208;holes, which are able to form attractive supramolecular interactions with electron rich partners through chalcogen bonds. Here, a multifaceted experimental and computational study of a large series of novel chalcogen&#8208;bonded cocrystals, prepared using the principles of crystal engineering, is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that dicyanoselenadiazole and dicyanotelluradiazole derivatives work as promising supramolecular synthons with the ability to form double chalcogen bonds with a wide range of electron donors including halides and oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Extensive 77Se and 125Te solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic investigations of cocrystals establish correlations between the NMR parameters of selenium and tellurium and the local chalcogen bonding geometry. The relationships between the electronic environment of the chalcogen bond and the 77Se and 125Te chemical shift tensors were elucidated through a natural localized molecular orbital density functional theory analysis. This systematic study of chalcogen&#8208;bond&#8208;based crystal engineering lays the foundations for the preparation of the various multicomponent systems and establishes solid&#8208;state NMR protocols to detect these interactions in powdered materials.

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Tetraaryltetrabenzoporphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>
The underrepresented class of tetraaryltetrabenzoporphyrins (TATBPs) is investigated thoroughly by DFT calculations, X&#8208;ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and photochemical studies. Fundamental and unexpected insights were gained about structural and electronic properties of this compound class, which will advance the research around TATPBs based technologies, such as in materials and life sciences.







Abstract
Tetraaryltetrabenzoporphyrins (TATBPs) show, due to their optoelectronic properties, rising potential as dyes in various fields of physical and biomedical sciences. However, unlike in the case of porphyrins, the potential structural diversity of TATBPs has been explored only to little extent, owed mainly to synthetic hurdles. Herein, we prepared a comprehensive library of 30 TATBPs and investigated their fundamental properties. We elucidated structural properties by X&#8208;ray crystallography and found explanations for physical properties such as solubility. Fundamental electronic aspects were studied by optical spectroscopy as well as by electrochemistry and brought in context to the stability of the molecules. Finally, we were able to develop a universal synthetic protocol, utilizing a readily established isoindole synthon, which gives TATBPs in high yields, regardless of the nature of the used arylaldehyde and without meticulous chromatographic purifications steps. This work serves as point of orientation for scientists, that aim to utilize these molecules in materials, nanotechnological, and biomedical applications.

      <title>Switching of Two&#8208;Photon Optical Properties by Anion Binding of Pyrrole&#8208;Based Boron Diketonates through Conformation Change</title>
      <dc:description>
Binding changes: Dipyrrolyldiketone BF2 complexes substituted with &#960;&#8208;extended units were used as anion&#8208;regulated systems with efficient two&#8208;photon optical properties (two&#8208;photon absorption and two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited fluorescence). A significant decrease in the transition dipole moments upon anion binding was caused by conformation changes and was the key factor for controlling the observed two&#8208;photon optical properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) dyes with intense fluorescence can be used to detect small chemical species and as sensors and bioimaging probes for specific analytes. Various TPA dyes responding to a number of external stimuli have been reported. Among them, biologically important anionic species have not been used as agents to control TPA properties because their direct electronic influences on the transition dipole moments of dyes are typically small. In this study, dipyrrolyldiketone BF2 complexes substituted with &#960;&#8208;extended units exhibited efficient TPA properties that could be regulated by conformation changes induced by anion binding. The TPA intensity decreased to 1/5 of the original intensity upon anion binding, which was much larger than that observed for one&#8208;photon absorption. Anion detection was achieved by a change in the emission intensity of spatially resolved spots of two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited fluorescence (TPEF) in the sample. Experimental and theoretical studies were performed to understand the mechanism of the TPA property control and showed that the drastic changes in the transition dipole moments upon conformation changes between the straight and bending forms of the &#960;&#8208;electronic systems caused the TPA and TPEF intensities drop.

      <title>Macroscopic Change in Luminescent Color by Thermally Driven Sliding Motion in [3]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Slide on by: A rational design for thermally driven switching of macroscopic properties in rotaxanes is described. At low temperatures, the luminophore is insulated by macrocycles and displays monomer emission, whereas at high temperatures, the luminophore is exposed owing to a change in the location of the macrocyclic and interacts with external molecules.







Abstract
Systematic investigation of rotaxane structures has revealed a rational design for thermally driven switching of their macroscopic properties. At low temperature, the luminophore is insulated by the macrocycles and displays monomer emission, whereas at high temperature, the luminophore is exposed owing to a change in the macrocyclic location distribution and interacts with external molecules, affording a thermally driven luminescent color change with high reversibility and responsiveness. This macroscopic switching through efficient thermal sliding was made possible by appropriate tuning of both the macrocycle&#8211;luminophore interactions within the rotaxane and the coupling between the excited luminophore and external molecules in an exciplex. The ability to switch properties by a simple and clean thermal stimuli should expand the utilization of rotaxanes as components of thermally driven molecular systems.

      <title>Modulating the Electronic and Solid&#8208;State Structure of Organic Semiconductors by Site&#8208;Specific Substitution: The Case of Tetrafluoropentacenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Under the influence of fluorine: The (photo&#8208;)physical and chemical properties of tetrafluoropentacene regioisomers are altered considerably in dependence of the substitution pattern. The variation of the fluorination degree and pattern of pentacenes provides a useful model for gaining detailed insight into forces that control crystallization and for studying the structure&#8211;property relationships of these organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The properties as well as solid&#8208;state structures, singlet fission, and organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) performance of three tetrafluoropentacenes (1,4,8,11: 10, 1,4,9,10: 11, 2,3,9,10: 12) are compared herein. The novel compounds&#8197;10 and 11 were synthesized in high purity from the corresponding 6,13&#8208;etheno&#8208;bridged precursors by reaction with dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate at elevated temperatures. Although most of the molecular properties of the compounds are similar, their chemical reactivity and crystal structures differ considerably. Isomer&#8197;10 undergoes the orbital symmetry forbidden thermal [4+4] dimerization, whereas 11 and 12 are much less reactive. The isomers 11 and 12 crystallize in a herringbone motif, but 10 prefers &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Although the energy of the first electric dipole&#8208;allowed optical transition varies only within 370&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (0.05&#8197;eV) for the neutral compounds, this amounts to roughly 1600&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (0.20&#8197;eV) for radical cations and 1300&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (0.16&#8197;eV) for dications. Transient spectroscopy of films of 11 and 12 reveals singlet&#8208;fission time constants (91&#177;11, 73&#177;3&#8197;fs, respectively) that are shorter than for pentacene (112&#177;9&#8197;fs). OFET devices constructed from 11 and 12 show close to ideal thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) characteristics with electron mobilities of 2&#215;10&#8722;3 and 6&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively.

      <title>Mechanism and Origin of Stereoselectivity in Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Aldol&#8208;Type Reactions of Azlactones with Vinyl Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanistic study: The chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;type reaction of azlactones with vinyl ethers was investigated. A Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type transition state consisting of the vinyl ether and the enol tautomer of the azlactone was identified on the basis of DFT calculations. Although hydrogen bonds are formed between the catalyst and the substrates, these are not involved in the bond recombination sequence and hence the catalyst functions as a template for binding the substrates.







Abstract
The precise mechanism of the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;type reaction of azlactones with vinyl ethers was investigated. DFT calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds through a Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type transition state consisting of the vinyl ether and the enol tautomer of the azlactone, in which the catalyst protonates the nitrogen atom of the azlactone to promote enol tautomerization. In addition, the phosphoryl oxygen of the catalyst interacts with the vinyl proton of the vinyl ether. The favorable transition structure features dicoordinating hydrogen bonds. However, these hydrogen bonds are not involved in the bond recombination sequence and hence the catalyst functions as a template for binding substrates. From the results of theoretical studies and experimental supports, the high enantioselectivity is induced by the steric repulsion between the azlactone substituent and the binaphthyl backbone of the catalyst under the catalyst template effect.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mechanistic study&lt;/b&gt;: The chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;type reaction of azlactones with vinyl ethers was investigated. A Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type transition state consisting of the vinyl ether and the enol tautomer of the azlactone was identified on the basis of DFT calculations. Although hydrogen bonds are formed between the catalyst and the substrates, these are not involved in the bond recombination sequence and hence the catalyst functions as a template for binding the substrates.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise mechanism of the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;type reaction of azlactones with vinyl ethers was investigated. DFT calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds through a Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type transition state consisting of the vinyl ether and the enol tautomer of the azlactone, in which the catalyst protonates the nitrogen atom of the azlactone to promote enol tautomerization. In addition, the phosphoryl oxygen of the catalyst interacts with the vinyl proton of the vinyl ether. The favorable transition structure features dicoordinating hydrogen bonds. However, these hydrogen bonds are not involved in the bond recombination sequence and hence the catalyst functions as a template for binding substrates. From the results of theoretical studies and experimental supports, the high enantioselectivity is induced by the steric repulsion between the azlactone substituent and the binaphthyl backbone of the catalyst under the catalyst template effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microporous Carbon Nanofibers Derived from Poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon nanofiber supercapacitors: An acrylonitrile&#8211;acrylic acid copolymer P(AN&#8208;co&#8208;AA) was transformed into microporous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by electrospinning and calcination. The micropore structure, formed by thermal degradation of the AA segment during thermal treatment, and N doping can be controlled by adjusting the AN/AA ratio. The CNFs have high specific surface area and show high specific capacitance and excellent cycling stability as electrode materials in supercapacitors.







Abstract
Carbon nanofiber (CNF)&#8208;based supercapacitors have promising applications in the field of energy storage. It is desirable, but remains challenging, to develop CNF electrode materials with large specific surface area (SSA), high specific capacitance (SC), and high power density, as well as excellent cycling stability and high reliability. Herein, acrylonitrile&#8211;acrylic acid copolymer P(AN&#8208;co&#8208;AA) was synthesized for the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;doped microporous CNFs. Thermal degradation of the AA segment leads to the formation of micropores that are distributed not only on the CNF surface, but also inside the material. The microporous structure and nitrogen content can be manipulated at the molecular level by adjusting the weight ratio between AN and AA, and the SSA and SC could reach as high as 1099&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 156&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. After KOH activation, the activated CNFs have an extremely high SSA of 2117&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and SC of 320&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which are among the highest values ever reported for electric double&#8208;layer supercapacitors with an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the capacitance retention, which can be maintained at 99&#8201;% even after 16&#8201;000 cyclic tests, reveals outstanding durability and repeatability.

      <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;Rich cyclophanes: Unprecedented, highly charged cyclophanes with diboranyl units are synthesized and their redox and optical properties studied.







Abstract
Herein reported are the reactions of an electron&#8208;rich, Lewis acidic diborane with N&#8208;heterocyclic aromatics to give first members of an unprecedented family of highly charged cationic cyclophanes with diboranyl units. Tetracationic cyclophanes with 4,4&#8216;&#8208;bipyridine/ 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene and diboranyl units were synthesized and their redox chemistry was studied. Cyclisation of two diboranyl and two pyrazine units is accompanied by electron transfer from the diboranyl unit to the pyrazine. Our results pave the way for the integration of redox&#8208;active diboranyl units into cyclophanes and supramolecular structures.

      <title>Influencing the Self&#8208;Sorting Behavior of [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Based Ligands by Introducing Isostructural Binding Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>
Two isostructural ligands with either nitrile (Lnit) or isonitrile (Liso) moieties attached to a [2.2]paracyclophane backbone have been synthesized. Surprisingly, the resulting discrete metallosupramolecular aggregates formed in solution upon coordination of [(dppp)Pd(OTf)2] differ in their composition and in their chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior. Upon crystallization these discrete aggregates undergo structural transformation to coordination polymers.







Abstract
Two isostructural ligands with either nitrile (Lnit) or isonitrile (Liso) moieties directly connected to a [2.2]paracyclophane backbone with pseudo&#8208;meta substitution pattern have been synthesized. The ligand itself (Lnit) or its precursors (Liso) were resolved by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase and the absolute configuration of the isolated enantiomers was assigned by XRD analysis and/or by comparison of quantum&#8208;chemical simulated and experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Surprisingly, the resulting metallosupramolecular aggregates formed in solution upon coordination of [(dppp)Pd(OTf)2] differ in their composition: whereas Lnit forms dinuclear complexes, Liso exclusively forms trinuclear ones. Furthermore, they also differ in their chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior as (rac)&#8208;Liso undergoes exclusive social self&#8208;sorting leading to a heterochiral assembly, whereas (rac)&#8208;Liso shows a twofold preference for the formation of homochiral complexes in a narcissistic self&#8208;sorting manner as proven by ESI mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, upon crystallization, these discrete aggregates undergo structural transformation to coordination polymers, as evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

      <title>Structuring Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Materials into Hierarchically Porous Composites through One&#8208;Pot Fabrication Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;All&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; porous structure: In this work, we introduce a straightforward one&#8208;pot fabrication strategy to prepare a robust and flexible hierarchically macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micro porous HKUST&#8208;1 / polyvinylidene fluoride composite by solvent evaporation, in which MOF crystallization and polymer precipitation are combined. The obtained composite showed an enhanced CO2 adsorption rate and high gas adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based materials with multiple levels of porous structures across different length scales is of great interest in various applications but it still remains challenging. Most of the current strategies are time consuming and labor intensive, and not readily scaled&#8208;up. In this work, we introduce a straightforward one&#8208;pot fabrication strategy to prepare a robust and flexible hierarchically macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micro porous HKUST&#8208;1/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite through solvent evaporation, in which MOF crystallization and polymer precipitation are combined together. The effect of the MOF precursor and the polymer initial amount on the morphology of the final composite was thoroughly studied. The interaction between the MOF and the polymer during the evaporation process is the key factor, which would limit the mobility of the polymer chains and cause instability in the MOF growth, thus endowing the composite with a hierarchically macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micro porous structure. This &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; porous structure could enhance the mass transport property of molecules within the composite. The obtained HKUST&#8208;1/PVDF composite showed an enhanced CO2 adsorption rate constant of 0.821&#8197;min&#8722;1 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar), which was 3.5&#8197;times higher than that of the pristine MOF. In addition, the composite showed an equivalent gas adsorption capacity under all tested pressures and greatly improved water stability.

      <title>Understanding the Driving Mechanisms of Enhanced Luminescence Emission of Oligo(styryl)benzenes and Tri(styryl)&#8208;s&#8208;triazine</title>
      <dc:description>
Stars vs. crosses: Aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement is observed in star&#8208;shaped molecules based on 1,3,5&#8208;tris(styryl)benzene and tri(styryl)&#8208;s&#8208;triazine cores, but not in cross&#8208;shaped structures, such as 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetra(styryl)benzene. The mechanisms for these processes are investigated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
This work is focused on unraveling the mechanisms responsible for the aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement effects observed in star&#8208;shaped molecules based on 1,3,5&#8208;tris(styryl)benzene and tri(styryl)&#8208;s&#8208;triazine cores. To achieve this, the photophysical properties of this set of molecules were analyzed in three states: free molecules, molecular aggregates in solution, and the solid state. Different spectroscopy and microscopy experiments and DFT calculations were conducted to scrutinize the causative mechanisms of the luminescence enhancement phenomenon observed in some experimental conditions. Enhanced luminescence emission was interpreted in the context of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range excitonic coupling mechanisms and the restriction of intramolecular vibrations. Additionally, we found that the formation of &#960;&#8208;stacking aggregates could block E/Z photoisomerization through torsional motions between phenylene rings in the excited state, and hence, enhancing the luminescence of the system.

      <title>A Mild and Versatile Friedel&#8211;Crafts Methodology for the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active 3&#8208;Benzoylmenadiones with Tunable Redox Potentials</title>
      <dc:description>
A new Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation variant/oxidative demethylation pathway allowed the introduction of broad structural diversity at the aroyl chain of 3&#8208;benzoylmenadiones. The electrochemical study highlighted an electronic communication between the redox&#8208;active naphthoquinone core and the 3&#8208;aroyl subunit, upon the second one&#8208;electron transfer, under the control of the R groups.







Abstract
A series of highly diversified 3&#8208;aroylmenadiones was prepared by a new Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation variant/oxidative demethylation strategy. A mild and versatile acylation was performed between 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylnaphthalene and various activated/deactivated benzoic and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, in the presence of mixed trifluoroacetic anhydride and triflic acid, at room temperature and in air. The 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylnaphthalene&#8208;derived benzophenones were isolated in high yield, and submitted to oxidative demethylation with cerium ammonium nitrate to produce 3&#8208;benzoylmenadiones. All 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone derivatives were investigated as redox&#8208;active electrophores by cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical data recorded for 3&#8208;acylated menadiones are characterized by a second redox process, the potentials of which cover a wide range of values (500&#8197;mV). These data emphasize the ability of the generated structural diversity at the 3&#8208;aroyl chain of these electrophores to fine&#8208;tune their corresponding redox potentials. These properties are of significance in the context of antimalarial drug development and understanding of the mechanism of bioactivation/action.

      <title>Metal Exchange in the Interprotein ZnII&#8208;Binding Site of the Rad50 Hook Domain: Structural Insights into CdII&#8208;Induced DNA&#8208;Repair Inhibition</title>
      <dc:description>
A genotoxic swap: ZnII&#8208;to&#8208;CdII displacement in the intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site of the DNA&#8208;binding protein Rad50 drastically elevates the stability of the metal&#8211;protein complex and disrupts its overall assembly.







Abstract
CdII is a major genotoxic agent that readily displaces ZnII in a multitude of zinc proteins, abrogates redox homeostasis, and deregulates cellular metalloproteome. To date, this displacement has been described mostly for cysteine(Cys)&#8208;rich intraprotein binding sites in certain zinc finger domains and metallothioneins. To visualize how a ZnII&#8208;to&#8208;CdII swap can affect the target protein's status and thus understand the molecular basis of CdII&#8208;induced genotoxicity an intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site from the crucial DNA repair protein Rad50 and its zinc hook domain were examined. By using a length&#8208;varied peptide base, ZnII&#8208;to&#8208;CdII displacement in Rad50&#8217;s hook domain is demonstrated to alter it in a bimodal fashion: 1)&#8197;CdII induces around a two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude stabilization effect (log&#8201;
=20.8 vs. log&#8201;
=22.7), which defines an extremely high affinity of a peptide towards a metal ion, and 2)&#8197;the displacement disrupts the overall assembly of the domain, as shown by NMR spectroscopic and anisotropy decay data. Based on the results, a new model explaining the molecular mechanism of CdII genotoxicity that underlines CdII&#8217;s impact on Rad50&#8217;s dimer stability and quaternary structure that could potentially result in abrogation of the major DNA damage response pathway is proposed.

      <dc:description>
An extreme affinity of CdII towards the interprotein Rad50 zinc hook domain visualizes how a ZnII&#8208;to&#8208;CdII swap can affect the target protein's status and thus illuminate the molecular basis of CdII&#8208;induced genotoxicity. This work showed that CdII binding to the interprotein Rad50 hook domain induces a two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude stabilization effect, which disrupts the overall assembly of the domain and may cause dysfunction of the MRN/X complex.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An extreme affinity of Cd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; towards the interprotein Rad50 zinc hook domain visualizes how a Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;Cd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; swap can affect the target protein's status and thus illuminate the molecular basis of Cd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;induced genotoxicity. This work showed that Cd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; binding to the interprotein Rad50 hook domain induces a two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude stabilization effect, which disrupts the overall assembly of the domain and may cause dysfunction of the MRN/X complex.

      <dc:description>
Separation of light hydrocarbons is a crucial industrial procedure that comprises a significant share of the total global energy consumption annually. Adsorptive separations using porous organic frameworks (POFs) have received intensive attention due to their lower energy costs and higher efficiency. The Minireview by L. Jiang, H. Ren et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;3205&#8197;ff., gives a summary of the recent progress in the use of POFs for light hydrocarbon separations and highlights the relationships between the structural features of these materials and their separation performances.

      <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are developed as crystal engineering tools. Dicyanoselenadiazole and dicyanotelluradiazole derivatives are promising supramolecular synthons with the ability to form double chalcogen bonds with a wide range of electron donors including halides and oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. An extensive 77Se and 125Te solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic investigation of a large series of cocrystals establishes correlations between the NMR parameters of selenium and tellurium and the local ChB geometry.

Transformer&#8208;tive chemistry: High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) is changing the way we work in many fields of chemistry. A personal perspective, describing the distinctions between traditional synthetic organic chemistry and HTE from a careers and impact viewpoint.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) is a growing, enabling technology that allows the execution of large, parallel sets of experiments. Often, automation is required to dose compounds on milligram to sub&#8208;milligram scale, to run many parallel reactions, and to analyse large datasets. Unique approaches to screen design, implementation, and analysis are required, distinct from traditional synthetic organic chemistry. The discipline also presents a profitable opportunity for individual scientists to learn about and explore fields adjacent to chemistry, including data science, robotics and equipment engineering, and computer programming. This perspective presents the author's viewpoints on the field of HTE, its implementation within a chemistry career, and the automated future of organic chemistry technology.

      <title>Light Hydrocarbon Separations Using Porous Organic Framework Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
As an emerging family of porous materials, porous organic frameworks (POFs) represent a promising avenue for development in the separation and purification of light hydrocarbons (C1&#8211;C3) due to their advantageous features. This Minireview summarizes the recent advances in the use of POFs for light hydrocarbon separations, while highlighting the relationships between the structural features of POFs and their separation performances.







Abstract
Light hydrocarbons (C1&#8211;C3) are used as basic energy feedstocks and as commodity organic compounds for the production of many industrially necessary chemicals. Due to the nature of the raw materials and production processes, light hydrocarbons are generated as mixtures, but the high&#8208;purity single&#8208;component products are of vital importance to the petrochemical industry. Consequently, the separation of these C1&#8211;C3 products is a crucial industrial procedure that comprises a significant share of the total global energy consumption per year. As a complement to traditional separation methods (distillation, partial hydrogenation, etc.), adsorptive separations using porous solids have received widespread attention due to their lower energy costs and higher efficiency. Extensive research has been devoted to the use of porous materials such as zeolites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid adsorbents for these key separations, owing to the high porosity, tunable pore structures, and unsaturated metal sites present in these materials. Recently, porous organic framework (POF) materials composed of organic building blocks linked by covalent bonds have also shown excellent properties in light hydrocarbon adsorption and separation, sparking interest in the use of these materials as adsorbents in separation processes. This Minireview summarizes the recent advances in the use of POFs for light hydrocarbon separations, including the separation of mixtures of methane/ethane, methane/propane, ethylene/ethane, acetylene/ethylene, and propylene/propane, while highlighting the relationships between the structural features of these materials and their separation performances. Finally, the difficulties, challenges, and opportunities associated with leveraging POFs for light hydrocarbon separations are discussed to conclude the review.

      <title>Manipulating Slow Magnetic Relaxation by Light in a Charge Transfer {Fe2Co} Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
An important characteristic of the {Fe2Co} compound is that the S=
 ground state exhibits slow magnetic relaxation before irradiation, whereas this is accelerated after irradiation. This is different from the typical behavior, where the light&#8208;induced metastable state exhibits slow magnetic relaxation.







Abstract
Some cyanide&#8208;bridged complexes are known for exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behavior in a light&#8208;induced metastable state. Herein, an unexpected reverse effect is observed for the first time in the S=
 {FeIILS&#8208;CoIIILS&#8208;FeIIILS} (HS=high spin, LS=low spin) ground state of a novel V&#8208;shaped trinuclear cyanide&#8208;bridged {Fe2Co} complex. In this complex, light&#8208;switchable iron&#8208;cobalt charge transfer with repeatable off/on switching of slow magnetic relaxation is discovered upon alternating laser irradiation at 785 and 560&#8197;nm. An important characteristic of the present compound is that the S=
 ground state exhibits slow magnetic relaxation before irradiation, whereas this is accelerated after irradiation. This is different from the typical behavior, where the light&#8208;induced metastable state exhibits slow magnetic relaxation.

      <title>Synthesis of Benzodiazepines Through Ring Opening/Ring Closure of Benzimidazole Salts</title>
      <dc:description>
Taylor&#8208;made benzodiazepines: A one&#8208;step synthesis of pyrido&#8208;benzodiazepine backbones and its analogues is achieved through continuous ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis of benzimidazole salts and intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Pyrido&#8208;benzodiazepine derivatives are undoubtedly one of the most important structural motifs in the marketed drugs and the drug candidates. Commonly synthetic methods for construction of the benzodiazepine ring derivatives are based on the condensation reactions of two highly functionalized synthons. The development of synthesis for these compounds, however, is hampered by the regioselectivity and atom economy. In this work, a one&#8208;step synthesis of pyrido&#8208;benzodiazepine backbones and its analogues is achieved through continuous ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis of benzimidazole salts and intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation. The reaction mechanism is explored by control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

      <title>Three&#8208;Coordinate Rhodium Complexes in Low Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>
Trigonal&#8208;planar rhodium complexes in low oxidation states are feasible by combination of a highly flexible diolefin and a bulky ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the diamagnetic Rh(&#8208;I) complex gives the paramagnetic Rh0 counterpart, a unique metal&#8208;centered radical with the unpaired electron in the dz2 orbital. Code color: Rh (yellow), K (pink), Si (green), O (red), N (blue), C (gray).







Abstract
The isolation of simultaneously low&#8208;coordinate and low&#8208;valent compounds is a timeless challenge for preparative chemists. This work showcases the preparation and full characterization of tri&#8208;coordinate rhodium(&#8208;I) and rhodium(0) complexes as well as a rare rhodium(I) complex. Reduction of [{Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(IPr)(dvtms)}2] (1, IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; dvtms=divinyltetramethyldisiloxane) with KC8 gave the trigonal complexes K[Rh(IPr)(dvtms)] and [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)], whereas the cation [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)]+ results from their oxidation or by abstraction of chloride from 1 with silver salts. The paramagnetic Rh0 complex is a unique fully metal&#8208;centered radical with the unpaired electron in the dz2 orbital. The Rh(&#8208;I) complex reacts with PPh3 with replacement of the NHC ligand, and behaves as a nucleophile, which upon reaction with [AuCl(PPh3)] generates the trigonal pyramidal complex [(IPr)(dvtms)Rh&#8208;Au(PPh3)] with a metal&#8211;metal bond between two d10 metal centers.

      <title>Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Dehydrogenation&#8208;Dehydrocoupling: An Atom Economical Access to Alkynylboranes</title>
      <dc:description>
A tandem made for two: An efficient synthesis of alkynylaminoborane was developed using a magnesium catalyst at room temperature. The reaction proceeds within few minutes in high yields releasing hydrogen through a tandem dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling original mechanism between terminal alkynes and boranes.







Abstract
Owing to the unusual reactivity of sterically hindered amine&#8211;borane complexes, a catalytic system based on magnesium salts was designed to perform a tandem dehydrogenation&#8211;dehydrocoupling between terminal alkynes and boranes. The reaction is providing pure alkynylboranes within few minutes at room temperature, with only two molecules of hydrogen as a byproduct.

      <title>Electrophotocatalytic Undirected C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylations of (Het)Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperation: Electrophotochemical C&#8722;H trifluoromethylations of unbiased arenes were accomplished by the cooperative action of electricity and light under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Electrophotochemistry has enabled arene C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation with the Langlois reagent CF3SO2Na under mild reaction conditions. The merger of electrosynthesis and photoredox catalysis provided a chemical oxidant&#8208;free approach for the generation of the CF3 radical. The electrophotochemistry was carried out in an operationally simple manner, setting the stage for challenging C&#8722;H trifluoromethylations of unactivated arenes and heteroarenes. The robust nature of the electrophotochemical manifold was reflected by a wide scope, including electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient benzenes, as well as naturally occurring heteroarenes. Electrophotochemical C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation was further achieved in flow with a modular electro&#8208;flow&#8208;cell equipped with an in&#8208;operando monitoring unit for on&#8208;line flow&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, providing support for the single electron transfer processes.

      <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids and Deoxygenation of Alcohols by Electro&#8208;Induced Radical Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrochemical strategy produces alkyl radicals from readily accessible redox active esters and N&#8208;phthalimidoyl oxalates under catalyst&#8208;free and sustainable conditions within an undivided cell. The resulting carbon&#8208;centered radical was trapped by an electron&#8208;poor olefin or hydrogen atom source to furnish the new formed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond or reductive decarboxylation products, respectively.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;induced reduction of redox active esters and N&#8208;phthalimidoyl oxalates derived from naturally abundant carboxylic acids and alcohols provides a sustainable and inexpensive approach to radical formation via undivided electrochemical cells. The resulting radicals are trapped by an electron&#8208;poor olefin or hydrogen atom source to furnish the Giese reaction or reductive decarboxylation products, respectively. A broad range of carboxylic acid (1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176;) and alcohol (2&#176; and 3&#176;) derivatives are applicable in this catalyst&#8208;free reaction, which tolerated a diverse range of functional groups. This method features simple operation, is a sustainable platform, and has broad application.

      <title>A Spherically Shielded Triphenylamine and Its Persistent Radical Cation</title>
      <dc:description>
Single and happy: Extensive steric shielding of a bridged triphenylamine enabled the generation of a persistent N&#8208;centered radical cation with an intense absorption band in the visible region and a reliable oxidation/re&#8208;reduction process. X&#8208;ray structural analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), spectroelectrochemistry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to disclose the impact of one electron oxidation on the structural and electronic attributes.







Abstract
This work reports the design and synthesis of a sterically protected triphenylamine scaffold which undergoes one&#8208;electron oxidation to form an amine&#8208;centered radical cation of remarkable stability. Several structural adjustments were made to tame the inherent reactivity of the radical cation. First, the parent propeller&#8208;shaped triphenylamine was planarized with sterically demanding bridging units and, second, protecting groups were deployed to block the reactive positions. The efficiently shielded triphenylamine core can be reversibly oxidized at moderate potentials (+0.38&#8197;V, vs. Fc/Fc+ in CH2Cl2). Spectroelectrochemistry and chemical oxidation studies were employed to monitor the evolution of characteristic photophysical features. To obtain a better understanding of the impact of one&#8208;electron oxidation on structural and electronic properties, joint experimental and computational studies were conducted, including X&#8208;ray structural analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The sterically shielded radical cation combines various desirable attributes: A characteristic and unobstructed absorption in the visible region, high stability which enables storage for weeks without spectroscopically traceable degradation, and a reliable oxidation/re&#8208;reduction process due to effective screening of the planarized triphenylamine core from its environment.

Electrosynthesis: Benzannulated cycloalkanone carboxylic esters are obtained by ring&#8208;expansion of cyclic &#945;&#8208;(ortho&#8208;iodophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters. The reaction sequence starts with the electrochemical reduction of the iodoarene moiety. After nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group the transformation proceeds via a tricyclic benzocyclobutene intermediate, which finally undergoes C&#8722;C bond cleavage by a retro&#8208;aldol reaction (see scheme).







Abstract
Cyclic &#945;&#8208;(ortho&#8208;iodophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters were converted in a ring&#8208;expanding transformation to furnish benzannulated cycloalkanone carboxylic esters. The reaction sequence started by electrochemical reduction of the iodoarene moiety. In a mechanistic rationale, the resulting carbanionic species was adding to the carbonyl group under formation of a strained, tricyclic benzocyclobutene intermediate, which underwent carbon&#8211;carbon bond cleavage and rearrangement of the carbon skeleton by retro&#8208;aldol reaction. The scope of the reaction sequence was investigated by converting cyclic oxoesters with different ring sizes yielding benzocycloheptanone, &#8208;nonanone and &#8208;decanone derivatives in moderate to good yields. Furthermore, acyclic starting materials and cyclic compounds carrying additional substituents on the iodophenyl ring were submitted to this reaction sequence. The starting materials for this transformation are straightforwardly obtained by conversion of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with phenyliodobis(trifluoroacetate).

      <title>Corannulene&#8208;Based Electron Acceptors: Combining Modular and Practical Synthesis with Electron Affinity and Solubility</title>
      <dc:description>
A modular and practical synthetic route has been developed for the preparation of corannulene&#8208;based electron acceptors of high electron affinity and ready solubility in a range of organic solvents.







Abstract

      <title>Synergistic Biophysical Techniques Reveal Structural Mechanisms of Engineered Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides in Lipid Model Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>In the quest for new antibiotics, two novel engineered Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides (eCAPs) have been rationally designed. WLBU2 and D8 (all 8 valines are the D&#8208;enantiomer) efficiently kill both gram&#8208;negative and &#8211;positive bacteria, but WLBU2 is toxic and D8 non&#8208;toxic to eukaryotic cells. We explore protein secondary structure, location of peptides in six lipid model membranes, changes in membrane structure and pore evidence.&#160; We suggest that protein secondary structure is not a critical determinant of bactericidal activity, but that membrane thinning and dual location of WLBU2 and D8 in the membrane headgroup and hydrocarbon region may be important. While neither peptide thins the gram&#8208;negative lipopolysaccharide outer membrane model, both locate deep into its hydrocarbon region where they are primed for self&#8208;promoted uptake into the periplasm. The partially &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure of WLBU2 in a red blood cell (RBC) membrane model containing 50% cholesterol, could play a role in destabilizing this RBC membrane model causing pore formation that is not observed with the D8 random coil, which correlates with RBC hemolysis caused by WLBU2 but not by D8.</dc:description>

      <title>Differential Effects of Nitrogen&#8208;Substitution in 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;Membered Aromatic Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>The replacement of carbon with nitrogen can affect the aromaticity of organic rings. Nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations at the center of the aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems reveal that incorporating nitrogen into 5&#8209;membered heteroaromatic dienes has only a small influence on aromaticity. In contrast, each nitrogen incorporated into benzene results in a sequential and substantial loss of aromaticity. The contrasting effects of nitrogen&#8208;substitution in 5&#8209;membered dienes and benzene are reflected in their Diels&#8211;Alder reactivities as dienes. 1,2&#8208;Diazine experiences a 1011&#8208;fold increase in reactivity upon nitrogen&#8208;substitution at the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions, whereas a 5&#8209;membered heteroaromatic diene, furan, experiences a comparatively incidental 102&#8208;fold increase in reactivity upon nitrogen&#8208;substitution at the 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;positions.</dc:description>

      <title>Endohedral Metallofullerenes: New Structures and Unseen Phenomena</title>
      <dc:description>
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) serve as an ideal platform for the study of otherwise unstable metallic clusters owing to the protection afforded by fullerene cages. Herein, a systematic and comprehensive summary of the recent results of EMFs is presented according to the categories of monometallofullerenes, dimetallofullerenes, carbide clusterfullerenes, and nitride clusterfullerenes.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs), namely fullerenes with metallic species encapsulated inside, represent an ideal platform to investigate metal&#8211;metal or metal&#8211;carbon interactions at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) crystallography. Herein, recent progress in the identification of new structures and unprecedented properties are discussed according to the categories of monometallofullerenes, dimetallofullerenes, carbide clusterfullerenes, and nitride clusterfullerenes. In particular, the dimerization and the cage&#8208;isomer dependent oxidation state of the inner metal atom are summarized in terms of pristine monometallofullerenes. Metal&#8211;metal bonds involving lanthanide&#8211;lanthanides or actinide&#8211;actinides are discussed based on both experimental and theoretical studies. The cluster&#8211;cage matching and/or mutual selections, as well as the rarely seen M=C double bonds, are discovered in M2C2@C2n, U2C@C80, M2TiC@C80, and Ti3C3@C80. Subsequently, the geometries of different M3N clusters in various cages are discussed, revealing size&#8208;matching between the internal M3N cluster and the outer cage induced by the planarity of the cluster. Finally, an outlook regarding the future developments of the molecular structures and applications of EMFs is presented.

      <title>3D Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Encapsulated Metallic Nickel&#8211;Iron Alloy Nanoparticles for Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Constructing high&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust oxygen electrocatalysts toward rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries remains a big challenge. Herein, metallic Ni3Fe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in 3D porous N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel was prepared through a facile hydrothermal assembly and calcination process. Inspired by the unique configuration and strong electronic interactions between Ni3Fe and N&#8208;doped graphene, Ni3Fe&#8208;GA1 exhibited outstanding activity and stability for OER, ORR, and Zn&#8211;air batteries.

Abstract
The reaction between a dialkyl&#8208;substituted alumanyl anion and [Y(CH2SiMe3)2(thf)3][BPh4] resulted in the formation of (dialkylalumanyl)yttrium complex&#8197;2, which exhibits the first 2&#8208;center&#8211;2&#8208;electron (2&#8201;c&#8208;2&#8201;e) Al&#8722;Y bond. The 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of 2 together with an X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicated a C2v symmetrical structure. DFT calculations on 2 revealed that its LUMO consists of overlapping 3&#8201;p&#8208; and 4&#8201;d&#8208;orbitals of the Al and Y atoms, respectively, and that the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is narrow. The UV/Vis spectrum of 2 exhibited a visible absorption at 432&#8197;nm, which suggests that the strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting character of the three&#8208;coordinate dialkylalumanyl ligand generates a colored d0&#8208;complex that does not contain any &#960;&#8208;electrons.

      <title>Spin Crossover and Long&#8208;lived Excited States in a Reduced Molecular Ruby</title>
      <dc:description>The chromium(III) complex [CrIII(ddpd)2]3+ (molecular ruby) is reduced to the genuine chromium(II) complex [CrII(ddpd)2]2+ with d4 electron configuration. This reduced molecular ruby represents one of the very few chromium(II) complexes showing spin crossover (SCO). The reversible SCO is gradual with Tc around room temperature. The low&#8208;spin and high&#8208;spin chromium(II) isomers exhibit distinct spectroscopic and structural properties (UV/Vis/NIR, IR, EPR spectroscopies, single&#8208;crystal XRD). Excitation of [CrII(ddpd)2]2+ with UV light at 20 and 290 K generates electronically excited states with microsecond lifetimes. This initial study on the unique reduced molecular ruby paves the way for thermally and photochemically switchable magnetic systems based on chromium complexes complementing the well&#8208;established iron(II) SCO systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanobody&#8208;Ferritin Conjugate for Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ferritin is an iron&#8208;storage protein nanocage assembled by 24 subunits. The hollow cavity of ferritin enables its encapsulation of various therapeutic agents. Antibody&#8208;ferritin conjugate provides an effective approach for the targeted drug delivery. However, the complicated preparation and protein stability hampers wide applications of this system. Herein, we designed a novel nanobody&#8208;ferritin platform (Nb&#8208;Ftn) for targeted drug delivery. The site&#8208;specific conjugation between nanobody and ferritin is achieved by transglutaminase catalyzed protein ligation. This ligation strategy allows the Nb&#8208;conjugation after drug loading in ferritin, which avoids the deactivation of nanobody from the harsh pH required for drug encapsulation. To verify the tumor targeting of this Nb&#8208;Ftn platform, a photodynamic reagent, manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) was loaded into the ferritin cavity, and an anti&#8208;EGFR nanobody was conjugated to the surface of ferritin. The ferritin nanocage can encapsulate about 82 MnPc molecules. This MnPc@Nb&#8208;Ftn conjugate can be efficiently internalized by EGFR positive A431 cancer cells, but not by EGFR negative MCF&#8208;7 cells. Upon 730 nm laser irradiation, MnPc@Nb&#8208;Ftn selectively killed EGFR positive A431 cells by generating ROS, whereas no obvious damage was observed on MCF&#8208;7 cells. As ferritin can be used for encapsulation of various therapeutic agents, this work provides a strategy for facile construction of nanobody&#8208;ferritin for targeted drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Through the looking glass: Chiral recognition of substrates and products at the active sites of racemases and epimerases</title>
      <dc:description>Unlike most enzymes, which exhibit stereospecific substrate binding, racemases and epimerases bind and catalyze the reversible interconversion of enantiomeric and epimeric pairs of substrates.&#160;&#160;Over the past 15 years, a growing number of racemase and epimerase structures have been solved, furnishing insights into the nature of chiral recognition of substrates by these enzymes.&#160;&#160;Those enzymes catalyzing stereoinversion of a carbon acid substrate via a direct 1,1&#8208;proton transfer mechanism all bind their substrates in a mirror&#8208;image packing orientation.&#160;&#160;This does not apply generally to epimerases and racemases that use other mechanisms, such as NADH&#8208;dependent epimerases that employ a "flipping" mechanism.&#160;&#160;In general, polar groups are bound and fixed at the three binding determinants on the protein defining a pseudo&#8208;mirror plane, while nonpolar groups may be mobile.&#160;&#160;The hydrogen atoms on each stereocenter are positioned antipodal with respect to the pseudo&#8208;mirror plane, making a two&#8208;base mechanism imperative.&#160;&#160;Recognition that mirror&#8208;image packing is the common binding mode for enantiomeric or epimeric substrates of these enzymes should inform modelling/docking studies and protein engineering.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unlike most enzymes, which exhibit stereospecific substrate binding, racemases and epimerases bind and catalyze the reversible interconversion of enantiomeric and epimeric pairs of substrates.&#160;&#160;Over the past 15 years, a growing number of racemase and epimerase structures have been solved, furnishing insights into the nature of chiral recognition of substrates by these enzymes.&#160;&#160;Those enzymes catalyzing stereoinversion of a carbon acid substrate via a direct 1,1&#8208;proton transfer mechanism all bind their substrates in a mirror&#8208;image packing orientation.&#160;&#160;This does not apply generally to epimerases and racemases that use other mechanisms, such as NADH&#8208;dependent epimerases that employ a "flipping" mechanism.&#160;&#160;In general, polar groups are bound and fixed at the three binding determinants on the protein defining a pseudo&#8208;mirror plane, while nonpolar groups may be mobile.&#160;&#160;The hydrogen atoms on each stereocenter are positioned antipodal with respect to the pseudo&#8208;mirror plane, making a two&#8208;base mechanism imperative.&#160;&#160;Recognition that mirror&#8208;image packing is the common binding mode for enantiomeric or epimeric substrates of these enzymes should inform modelling/docking studies and protein engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>CHEMICAL FUNCTIONISATION OF 2D MATERIALS VIA BATCH AND CONTINUOUS HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS</title>
      <dc:description>2D materials are single or few layered materials consisting of one or several elements with a thickness of a few nanometers. Their unique, tunable physical and chemical properties including ease of chemical functionalization makes this class of materials useful in a variety of technological applications. The feasibility of 2D materials strongly depends on better synthetic approaches to improve properties, increase performance and durability and reduce costs. As such, in the synthesis of nanomaterials, hydrothermal processes are widely adopted through a precursor&#8208;product synthesis route. This method includes batch or continuous flow systems, both employing water at elevated temperatures (above boiling point) and pressures to fine tune the physical, chemical, optical and electronic properties of the nanomaterial. Both techniques yield particles with different morphology, size and surface area due to different mechanisms of particle formation. In this review, we present batch and continuous hydrothermal synthesis of a selection of 2D derivatives (graphene, MXene and molybdenum disulphide), their chemical functionalisation as an advantageous approach in exploring properties of these materials as well as the benefits and challenges of employing these processes, and an outlook for further research.</dc:description>

      <title>Towards the Molecular Design of Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes of 2,6&#8208;Bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines</title>
      <dc:description>
Spinning around: First N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines to induce a spin&#8208;crossover in otherwise high&#8208;spin iron(II) complexes are obtained by increasing, against the common wisdom, the steric demand of a bulky substituent. The proposed ligand design, which may be applicable to other popular ligands, opens the way for their molecular design as spin&#8208;crossover compounds.







Abstract
The molecular design of spin&#8208;crossover complexes relies on controlling the spin state of a transition metal ion by proper chemical modifications of the ligands. Herein, the first N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines (3&#8208;bpp) are reported that, against the common wisdom, induce a spin&#8208;crossover in otherwise high&#8208;spin iron(II) complexes by increasing the steric demand of a bulky substituent, an ortho&#8208;functionalized phenyl group. As N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;bpp complexes have no pendant NH groups that make their spin state extremely sensitive to the environment, the proposed ligand design, which may be applicable to isomeric 1&#8208;bpp or other families of popular bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and higher denticity ligands, opens the way for their molecular design as spin&#8208;crossover compounds for future breakthrough applications.

Specifically, the COF with both hydroxyl and methoxyl groups (OMe&#8208;OH&#8208;TPBP&#8208;COF) exhibits the highest catalytic activity and efficiency for CO2 cycloaddition (see figure).







Abstract
Three isostructural covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with either methoxyl, hydroxyl, or both groups on the channel wall, are synthesized and served as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2. Among them, the COF decorated with both hydroxyl and methoxyl groups named OMe&#8208;OH&#8208;TPBP&#8208;COF exhibits the highest catalytic activity and efficiency for CO2 cycloaddition under mild conditions.

      <title>A New One&#8208;Pot Fluorescence Derivatization Strategy for Highly Sensitive MicroRNA Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>
microRNAs made easy: A one&#8208;pot fluorescence derivatization strategy has been developed for highly sensitive microRNA analysis. Based on this derivatization strategy, a facile and sensitive high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography method was developed for quantitative assay of microRNAs.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate the expression of over 30&#8201;% of mammalian genes during development and apoptosis, and abnormal expression of miRNAs may lead to a range of human pathologies. Therefore, analysis of miRNAs is valuable for disease diagnostics. In this work, a novel one&#8208;pot fluorescence derivatization strategy was developed for miRNA analysis. The mechanism of the derivatization reaction was explored by using instrumental methods, including liquid chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Highly fluorescent N6&#8208;ethenoadenine (&#1013;&#8208;adenine) was formed and detached from the miRNA sequence through the reaction of adenine in nucleic acids with 2&#8208;chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) at 100&#8201;&#176;C. This is the first experimental evidence that the cooperation of formed &#1013;&#8208;adenine and water&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between the proton at the 2&#8242;&#8208; and the oxyanion at 3&#8242;&#8208;positions stabilized the oxocarbenium significantly, which makes the depurination and derivatization of miRNA highly effective. Based on this derivatization strategy, a facile and sensitive high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography method was developed for quantitative assay of miRNAs. In combination with magnetic solid&#8208;phase extraction (MSPE), the HPLC method was shown to be useful for the determination of microRNAs at sub&#8208;picomolar level in serum samples.

      <title>Electronic Properties of Oxidized Cyclometalated Diiridium Complexes: Spin Delocalization Controlled by the Mutual Position of the Iridium Centers</title>
      <dc:description>
Two isomer pairs of cyclometalated diiridium complexes, with IrCp*Cl termini bridged by 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(p&#8208;tolyliminoethyl)benzene, or 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, were prepared and fully characterized. Their different bonding and electronic properties in the neutral and monocationic states were studied by experimental spectroelectrochemical methods and DFT/TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Four cyclometalated diiridium complexes, with IrCp*Cl (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5&#8722;) termini bridged by 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(p&#8208;tolyliminoethyl)benzene (1, 2), or 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene (3, 4), were prepared and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (complexes&#8197;1, 2, and 4). The two iridium centers in complexes&#8197;1 and 3 are thus bound at the central benzene ring in the para&#8208;position (trans&#8208;Ir2), whereas those in complexes&#8197;2 and 4 are in the meta&#8208;position (cis&#8208;Ir2). Cyclic voltammograms of all four complexes show two consecutive one&#8208;electron oxidations. The potential difference between the two anodic steps in 1 and 3 is distinctly larger than that for 2 and 4. The visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8211;short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) absorption spectra of trans&#8208;Ir2 monocations&#8197;1+ and 3+ are markedly different from those of cis&#8208;Ir2 monocations&#8197;2+ and 4+. Notably, strong near&#8208;infrared electronic absorption appears only in the spectra of 1+ and 3+ whereas 2+ and 4+ absorb only weakly in the NIR&#8208;SWIR region. Combined DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations have revealed that (a)&#8197;1+ and 3+ (the diiridium&#8208;benzene trans&#8208;isomers) display the highest occupied spin&#8208;orbitals (HOSO) and the lowest unoccupied spin&#8208;orbital (LUSO) evenly delocalized over both molecule halves, and (b)&#8197;their electronic absorptions in the NIR&#8208;SWIR region are attributed to mixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfers (MLCT and LLCT). In contrast, cis&#8208;isomers&#8197;2+ and 4+ do not feature this stabilizing &#960;&#8208;delocalization but a localized mixed&#8208;valence state showing a weak intervalence charge&#8208;transfer (IVCT) absorption in the SWIR region.

      <title>Rational Stepwise Construction of Different Heterometallic&#8211;Organic Frameworks (HMOFs) for Highly Efficient CO2 Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
CO2 conversion: Two kinds of heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs) were obtained by using the monometallic complexes as the precursors based on a rational stepwise construction strategy and the theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB principle). These isolated MOFs were employed to study their catalytic efficacy in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. This work may provide a valuable approach towards tailoring more HMOFs with great catalytic activity.







Abstract
The coordination preference of different metal ions and ligands have an immense influence on the constructions of functional MOF materials. In this work, two new monometallic complexes, namely [Ag(HL)(bipy)0.5] (1) and {[Tb(L)1.5(H2O)]&#8901;4&#8201;H2O}n (2) (bipy=4,4&#8208;bipyridine), have been synthesized successfully by employing a bifunctional 2&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)terephthalic acid (H2L) ligand. After that, two new different heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs), namely {[TbAg(L)2(H2O)3]&#8901;H2O}n (3) and [TbAg(L)2(H2O)]n (4), were obtained from complexes&#8197;1 and 2 as the precursors based on a rational stepwise construction strategy and the theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB principle), respectively. The HMOFs bearing dual metallic catalytic sites (Tb and Ag) can be used as heterogeneous catalysts without losing performance for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxides including the sterically hindered epoxides, demonstrating some of the highest reported catalytic activity values. This work may provide a new synthetic route toward tailoring new HMOFs with excellent catalytic activity.

      <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Binder&#8208;Free Capacitive Deionization Electrode for Highly Efficient Sea Water Desalination</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;capacitive electrodes: Binder&#8208;free deionization electrodes fabricated by electrodeposition of SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier exhibiting a combination of pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance show excellent performance in water desalination due to the synergistic effect between the polyoxometalate and the polymer.







Abstract
Capacitive deionization is a promising technique in sea water desalination. Compared with common electrodes, mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes exhibit better performance in sea water desalination because they integrate pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance in one system. Herein, a 3D binder&#8208;free mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode was fabricated by direct electrodeposition of SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. In this electrode, SiW12O404&#8722;/polyaniline composite particles with a size of about 100&#8211;120&#8197;nm are dispersed homogenously on the 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. Its specific capacitance reaches 352&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. With increasing current from 1 to 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacitance only decays by 32&#8201;%. When employed in sea water desalination, the performance of this mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode is also excellent. At 1.2&#8197;V, the salt adsorption capacity of this mixed electrode reaches 23.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a salt adsorption rate of 1.38&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 in 500&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NaCl. The performance of this electrode is well retained after 30 cycles. The excellent sea water desalination performance originates from the synergistic effect between SiW12O404&#8722; and polyaniline. This work has developed polyoxometalate as a new material for capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitive deionization is a promising technique in sea water desalination. Compared with common electrodes, mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes exhibit better performance in sea water desalination because they integrate pseudocapacitance and electric double&#8208;layer capacitance in one system. Herein, a 3D binder&#8208;free mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode was fabricated by direct electrodeposition of SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline on a 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. In this electrode, SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/polyaniline composite particles with a size of about 100&#8211;120&#8197;nm are dispersed homogenously on the 3D exfoliated graphite carrier. Its specific capacitance reaches 352&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With increasing current from 1 to 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the specific capacitance only decays by 32&#8201;%. When employed in sea water desalination, the performance of this mixed capacitive&#8208;deionization electrode is also excellent. At 1.2&#8197;V, the salt adsorption capacity of this mixed electrode reaches 23.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a salt adsorption rate of 1.38&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 500&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; NaCl. The performance of this electrode is well retained after 30 cycles. The excellent sea water desalination performance originates from the synergistic effect between SiW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyaniline. This work has developed polyoxometalate as a new material for capacitive&#8208;deionization electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Orthogonal Halogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions Directed 2D Crystalline Supramolecular J&#8208;Dimer Lamellae</title>
      <dc:description>
An intriguing 2D lamellar dye&#8208;assembly with distinct dye organization in aqueous media driven by two orthogonal X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X halogen&#8208;bonding interactions was constructed. As the only building motif, antiparallel J&#8208;dimer was formed and stabilized by single &#960;&#8208;stacking and dual X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The constituent J&#8208;dimer units were linked by quadruple highly directional X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X bonds in a staggered manner, resulting in the unique 2D dye&#8208;lamellae (see figure).







Abstract
Dye assemblies exhibit fascinating properties and performances, both of which depend critically on the mutual packing arrangement of dyes and on the supramolecular architecture. Herein, we engineered, for the first time, an intriguing chlorosome&#8208;mimetic 2D crystalline J&#8208;dimer lamellar structure based on halogenated dyes in aqueous media by employing two distinct orthogonal halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions. As the only building motif, antiparallel J&#8208;dimer was formed and stabilized by single &#960;&#8208;stacking and dual halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. With two substituted halogen atoms acting as XB donors and the other two acting as acceptors, the constituent J&#8208;dimer units were linked by quadruple highly&#8208;directional halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen interactions in a staggered manner, resulting in unique 2D lamellar dye assemblies. This work champions and advances halogen&#8208;bonding as a remarkably potent tool for engineering dye aggregates with a controlled molecular packing arrangement and supramolecular architecture.

      <title>Recent Advances in Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Going with the flow: In recent years, continuous&#8208;flow techniques have received considerable attention and shown rapid progress in manufacturing. Among these, catalytic enantioselective flow processes using homogeneous, heterogeneous, or enzymatic catalysts have shown significant advantages over the conventional batch mode. In this Minireview, recent advances in continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective catalysis are summarized and discussed, with emphasis on studies published after 2013.







Abstract
The increased demand for more efficient, safe, and green production in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry calls for the development of continuous&#8208;flow manufacturing, and for chiral chemicals in particular, enantioselective catalytic processes. In recent years, this emerging direction has received considerable attention and has seen rapid progress. In most cases, catalytic enantioselective flow processes using homogeneous, heterogeneous, or enzymatic catalysts have shown significant advantages over the conventional batch mode, such as shortened reaction times, lower catalysts loadings, and higher selectivities in addition to the normal merits of non&#8208;enantioselective flow operations. In this Minireview, the advancements, key strategies, methods, and technologies developed the last six years as well as remaining challenges are summarized.

      <title>A Mechanistically and Operationally Simple Route to Metal&#8211;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
No free carbene required: Computational and experimental investigations of a weak base&#8208;assisted synthetic route leading to metal&#8211;NHC complexes suggest a concerted mechanism is at play. The method is exemplified with metal and nonmetal centers and establishes its synthetic utility.







Abstract
We have been puzzled by the involvement of weak organic and inorganic bases in the synthesis of metal&#8211;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. Such bases are insufficiently strong to permit the presumed required deprotonation of the azolium salt (the carbene precursor) prior to metal binding. Experimental and computational studies provide support for a base&#8208;assisted concerted process that does not require free NHC formation. The synthetic protocol was found applicable to a number of transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and main&#8208;group&#8208;centered NHC compounds and could become the synthetic route of choice to form M&#8211;NHC bonds.

      <title>Enhanced Long Persistent Luminescence by Multi&#8208;fold Interpenetration in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with long persistent luminescence (LPL) have caused widespread attention due to potential applications in displaying, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and so on. However, MOF materials are often with large pore size, which restricts the formation of efficient inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions to realize LPL. Herein, we report a new approach to achieve LPL in MOFs by multi&#8208;fold interpenetration of discrete frameworks. By the comparison between 3&#8208;fold and 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating MOFs, we found that the former with higher multiplicity and denser frameworks can be endowed with enhanced inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions, and thus prolonged long persistent luminescence is obtained. Meanwhile, metal cluster and heavy halogen effect could also arouse variations in LPL durations and colours.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Construction of 2D Fe3O4@Carbon Core&#8208;Shell nanosheets as Advanced Anode Materials for High Performance Lithium Ion Half/Full Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal oxides vastly limit practical applications due to their rapid capacity decay as an electrode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we have successfully employed a versatile strategy to mitigate the volume expansion and low conductivity of Fe  3  O  4  via coating a thin carbon layer on the surface of Fe  3  O  4  nanosheets (NSs). Benefiting from the 2D core&#8208;shell structures, the Fe  3  O  4  @C NSs exhibit significantly improved rate performance and cycle capability compared to bare Fe  3  O  4  NSs. Along with 200 cycles, the discharge capacity at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  is shown to be 963 mAh g  &#8208;1  (93% retained). Moreover, the lithium storage reaction mechanism is detailed studied by ex situ XRD and HRTEM techniques. When coupled with the commercial LiFePO  4  cathode, the full&#8208;cell retains a capacity of 133 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  , demonstrating its superior energy storage performance.

      <title>Exfoliation of 2D Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The fascinating properties of single&#8208;layer graphene isolated by mechanical exfoliation have inspired extensive research efforts toward two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. Layered compounds serve as precursors for atomically thin 2D materials (briefly, 2D nanomaterials) owing to their strong intraplane chemical bonding but weak interplane van der Waals interactions. There are newly emerging 2D materials beyond graphene, and it is becoming increasingly important to develop cost&#8208;effective, scalable methods for producing 2D nanomaterials with controlled microstructures and properties. The variety of developed synthetic techniques can be categorized into two classes: bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches. Of top&#8208;down approaches, the exfoliation of bulk 2D materials into single or few layers is the most common. This review highlights chemical and physical exfoliation methods that allow for the production of 2D nanomaterials in large quantities. In addition, remarkable examples of utilizing exfoliated 2D nanomaterials in energy and environmental applications are introduced.</dc:description>

      <title>Hetero Co&#8208;Encapsulation within a Supramolecular Cage. Moving Away from the Statistical Distribution of Different Guests</title>
      <dc:description>Beside sensing and delivery, another peculiar property arising from confinement in discrete molecular hosts comes from the possibility to have in close proximity, and in defined position, two different molecules (hetero co&#8208;encapsulation). This phenomenon can be tuned considering steric and electronic properties of the guests. In this work, a study on the parameters affecting homo and hetero co&#8208;encapsulation processes within a supramolecular cage is reported. In particular, different benzoate guests were bound within a supramolecular cage containing two metal binding sites and the experimental binding thermodynamics measured. Unexpectedly, from competition experiments we observed that the maximum concentration of hetero co&#8208;encapsulation is achieved if a weakly binding guest is used to partially displace a strongly binding guest.</dc:description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence for the Incorporation of Two Metals at Equivalent Lattice Positions in Mixed&#8208;Metal Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Two is company: The incorporation of Fe and Cu on crystallographically equivalent positions in a phase&#8208;pure mixed&#8208;metal HKUST&#8208;1 material was proven using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, this study showed that the presence of small amounts of other phases, which seemed neglectable based on standard characterization techniques, must not be ignored, since they might contain a major amount of one of the used metals.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing multiple metals distributed over crystallographically equivalent framework positions (mixed&#8208;metal MOFs) represent an interesting class of materials, since the close vicinity of isolated metal centers often gives rise to synergistic effects. However, appropriate characterization techniques for detailed investigations of these mixed&#8208;metal metal&#8211;organic framework materials, particularly addressing the distribution of metals within the lattice, are rarely available. The synthesis of mixed&#8208;metal FeCuBTC materials in direct syntheses proved to be difficult and only a thorough characterization using various techniques, like powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, unambiguously evidenced the formation of a mixed&#8208;metal FeCuBTC material with HKUST&#8208;1 structure, which contained bimetallic Fe&#8722;Cu paddlewheels as well as monometallic Cu&#8722;Cu and Fe&#8722;Fe units under optimized synthesis conditions. The in&#8208;depth characterization showed that other synthetic procedures led to impurities, which contained the majority of the applied iron and were impossible or difficult to identify using solely standard characterization techniques. Therefore, this study shows the necessity to characterize mixed&#8208;metal MOFs extensively to unambiguously prove the incorporation of both metals at the desired positions. The controlled positioning of metal centers in mixed&#8208;metal metal&#8211;organic framework materials and the thorough characterization thereof is particularly important to derive structure&#8211;property or structure&#8211;activity correlations.

      <title>Synthetic and Biological Studies on New Urea and Triazole Containing Cystobactamid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Fighting Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria: Thirteen new cystobactamids, derived from cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 are prepared by chemical synthesis. Main modifications are exchange of the amide group by the chemically more stable urea group and the triazole ring as located in ring A. Antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive bacteria including a multidrug&#8208;resistant strain can be preserved, when the urea function is located between rings A and B and the triazole is positioned between rings C and D.







Abstract
Cystobactamids belong to the group of arene&#8208;based oligoamides that effectively inhibit bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. Cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 is the most active member of these antibiotics. Most amide bonds present in the cystobactamids link benzoic acids with anilines and it was found that some of these amide bonds undergo chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, especially the one linking ring C with ring D. This work reports on the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of thirteen new cystobactamids that still contain the methoxyaspartate hinge. However, we exchanged selected amide bonds either by the urea or the triazole groups and modified ring A in the latter case. While hydrolytic stability could be improved with these structural substitutes, the high antibacterial potency of cystobactamid 861&#8208;2 could only be preserved in selected cases. This includes derivatives, in which the urea group is positioned between rings A and B and where the triazole is found between rings C and D.

Arylation: Monoarylation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of 8&#8208;methylquinolines is disclosed along with symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylation of 8&#8208;methylquinolines in one&#8208;pot and sequential manner, respectively.

Abstract
Herein, the RhIII&#8208;catalyzed selective monoarylation and diarylation (symmetrical and unsymmetrical) of 8&#8208;methylquinolines with organoboron reagents are disclosed. The selective monoarylation of primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is achieved by using 7&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methylquinolines or by changing the quantity of the aryl boronic acids. The method is also applicable for the arylation of 2&#8208;ethylpyridines, and the heteroarylation with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acids. Symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylation of 8&#8208;methylquinolines have been carried out in one&#8208;pot and sequential manner, respectively. Late&#8208;stage monoarylation of oxime derivatives and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of monoarylated products has also been carried out. A mechanistic study revealed that the current reaction is first order with respect to both reactants and a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate may be involved in the catalytic cycle.

Organic phosphorescence is closely related to the intermolecular interactions, because such interactions are beneficial to promote SOC and boost ISC efficiency and finally conducive to achieve satisfactory phosphorescence.

Energy and electron transfer events were observed in  ABDP  /  ZnTPP  upon photoexcitation. However, in the case of  ABDP  /  ZnTPP/GR  , the graphene induced aggregation of the chromophores alters their electronic interactions, enhancing the energy/electron transfer process between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Hydration Change in a Gd&#8208;Based MRI Contrast Agent with a Phosphonated Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
The size of water: Around physiological pH, a pH&#8208;dependent hydration change is observed in a Gd complex, engendering large changes in its relaxivity properties. Protonation of the ligand induces hydrogen bonding within the phosphonated arms with the concomitant entry of a second water molecule.







Abstract
The heptadentate ligand L was shown to form an extremely stable Gd complex at neutral pH with a pGd value of 18.4 at pH&#8197;7.4. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the complexes formed with Gd and Tb displayed two very different coordination behaviors being, respectively, octa&#8208; and nonacoordinated. The relaxometric properties of the Gd complex were studied by field&#8208;dependent relaxivity measurements at various temperatures and by 17O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The pH&#8208;dependence of the longitudinal relaxivity profile indicated large changes around neutral pH leading to a very large value of 10.1&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8901;s&#8722;1 (60&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K) at pH&#8197;4.7. The changes were attributed to an increase of the hydration number from one water molecule in basic conditions to two at acidic pH. A similar trend was observed for the luminescence of the Eu complex, confirming the change in hydration state. DOSY experiments were performed on the Lu analogue, pointing to the absence of dimers in solution in the considered pH range. A breathing mode of the complex was postulated, which was further supported by 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of the Yb complex at varying pH and was finally modeled by DFT calculations.

      <title>An Isolable Bis(Silanone&#8211;Borane) Adduct</title>
      <dc:description>
Si=O&#8594;B in a bis(silanone): Reaction of ferrocene&#8208;bridged bis(silylene&#8211;borane) 2, prepared from the bis(silylene) and BPh3, with CO2 quantitatively generates a Lewis acid&#8208;stabilized bis(silanone) 3 with two Si=O&#8594;B moieties. Removal off BPh3 with PMe3 yields 1,3,2,4&#8208;cyclodisiloxane 4 through intramolecular Si=O head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization. In contrast, reaction of 2 with elemental sulfur furnishes the borane&#8208;free bis(silathione) 5.







Abstract
The reaction of bis(silylenyl)&#8208;substituted ferrocene 1 with two molar equivalents of BPh3 yields the corresponding bis(silylene&#8211;borane) Lewis adduct 2. The latter is capable to activate CO2 to furnish the borane&#8208;stabilized bis(silanone) 3 through mono&#8208;oxygenation of the dative SiII&#8594;B silicon centers under release of CO. Removal of BPh3 from 3 with PMe3 affords the corresponding 1,3,2,4&#8208;cyclodisiloxane and the Me3P&#8722;BPh3 adduct. All isolated new compounds were characterized and their molecular structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

      <title>Factors Governing the Activity of a&#8208;MnO2 Catalysts in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Conductivity vs. Exposed Surface Area of Cryptomelane</title>
      <dc:description>Cryptomelane (&#945;&#8208;(K)MnO  2  ) powders were synthesized by different methods leading to only minor differences in their bulk crystal structure and chemical composition, while the BET surface area and the crystallize size differed significantly. Their performance in OER covered a wide range and their sequence of increasing activity differed when electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte and chemical water oxidation using Ce  4+  were compared. The decisive factors that explain this difference were identified in the catalysts&#8217; microstructure. Chemical water oxidation activity is substantially governed by the exposed surface area, while the electrocatalytic activity is determined largely by the electric conductivity, which was found to correlate with the particle morphology in terms of needle length and aspect ratio in this sample series. This correlation is rather explained by an improved conductivity due to longer needles than by structure sensitivity as was supported by reference experiments using H  2  O  2  decomposition and carbon black as additive. The most active catalyst R&#8208;Cryptomelane reached a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8209;2  at a potential 1.73 V without, and at 1.71 V in presence of carbon black. The improvement was significantly higher for catalyst with lower initial activity. However, the materials showed a disappointing catalytic stability during alkaline electrochemical OER, while the crystal structure was found to be stable at working conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescent cyclic dinucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) play important roles in regulating biofilm formation, motility and virulence. In eukaryotic cells, theses bacterial CDNs are recognized as pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger an innate immune response. We report the photophysical analyses of a novel group of enzymatically synthesized emissive CDN analogues comprised of two families of isomorphic ribonucleotides. The highly favorable photophysical features of the CDN analogues, when compared to their non&#8208;emissive natural counterparts, are used to monitor in real time the dinucleotide cyclase&#8208;mediated synthesis and phosphodiesterase (PDE)&#8208;mediated hydrolysis of homodimeric and mixed CDNs, providing effective means to probe the activities of two classes of bacterial enzymes and insight into their biomolecular recognition and catalytic features.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bacterial cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) play important roles in regulating biofilm formation, motility and virulence. In eukaryotic cells, theses bacterial CDNs are recognized as pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger an innate immune response. We report the photophysical analyses of a novel group of enzymatically synthesized emissive CDN analogues comprised of two families of isomorphic ribonucleotides. The highly favorable photophysical features of the CDN analogues, when compared to their non&#8208;emissive natural counterparts, are used to monitor in real time the dinucleotide cyclase&#8208;mediated synthesis and phosphodiesterase (PDE)&#8208;mediated hydrolysis of homodimeric and mixed CDNs, providing effective means to probe the activities of two classes of bacterial enzymes and insight into their biomolecular recognition and catalytic features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Versatile Approach to Dynamic Amide Bond Formation with Imine Nucleophiles</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry has rapidly become an important approach to access supramolecular structures. While the products generated in these reactions are held together by covalent bonds, the reversible nature of the transformations can limit the utility of many these systems in creating robust materials. We describe here a method to form stable and commonly employed amide bonds by exploiting the reversible coupling of imines and acyl chlorides. The reaction employs easily accessible reagents, is dynamic under ambient conditions, without catalysts, and can be trapped with simple hydrolysis. This offers an approach to create broad families of amide products under thermodynamic control, including the selective formation of amide macrocycles or polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemistry in the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal oxide thin films by solution methods</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemistry has emerged in the last few years as a powerful tool for the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal oxide thin films prepared by solution methods. Today, its implementation into the fabrication procedure makes possible the integration of amorphous semiconductors or functional crystalline oxides into flexible electronic systems at temperatures below 350 &#186;C. In this review, the effects of UV irradiation at the different stages of the chemical solution deposition of metal oxide thin films are presented. These stages include from the synthesis of the precursor solution to the formation of the amorphous metal&#8208;oxygen network in the film and its subsequent crystallization into the oxide phase. Photochemical reactions that can be induced in both the solution deposited layer and the irradiation atmosphere are first described, highlighting the role of the potential reactive chemical species formed in the system under irradiation, such as free radicals or oxidizing compounds. Then, the photochemical effects of continuous UV light on the film are shown, focusing on the decomposition of the metal precursors, the condensation and densification of the metal&#8208;oxygen network, and the nucleation and growth of the crystalline oxide. All these processes are demonstrated to advance the formation and crystallization of the metal oxide thin film to an earlier stage, which is ultimately translated into a lower temperature range of fabrication. The reduced energy consumption of the process upon decreasing the processing temperature, and the prospect of using light instead of heat in the synthesis of inorganic materials, make photochemistry as a promising technique for a sustainable future ever more needed in our life.</dc:description>

      <title>Scholl&#8208;Type Cycloheptatriene Ring Closure of 1,4,9,12&#8208;Tetraarylfenestrindanes: Reactivity and Selectivity in the Construction of Fenestrane&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Saddles</title>
      <dc:description>
Saddle up! The reactivity of thirteen symmetrical and two unsymmetrical tetraarylfenestrindanes towards fourfold Scholl&#8208;type heptagonal ring closure to generate the corresponding saddle&#8208;shaped derivatives was examined, with six new successful examples. The reaction mechanism and the observed selectivity of the twofold cyclization were also investigated by both experiments and DFT calculations (DDQ=dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone).







Abstract
The Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation, generating up to four cycloheptatriene rings around a fenestrindane core, leads to novel, saddle&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbon derivatives. In this article, we present the results of in&#8208;depth experimental and computational work on the oxidative cyclization of various 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes. In particular, the kinetic control of the four&#8208;step cyclization of the electronically activated tetrakis(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) derivative is elucidated. The reasons for the exclusive emergence of one single among the three possible doubly cyclized intermediates and for the nonappearance of the singly and triply cyclized intermediates are clarified. In addition, the origin of the concomitant bridgehead hydroxylation is studied. The reactivity of a set of fifteen symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraarylfenestrindanes towards Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation is presented, pinpointing the structural factors that underlie this reaction and demonstrating the potential and limitations of this synthetic approach. A particularly surprising finding of this study is that the electronically nonactivated 1,4,9,12&#8208;tetraphenylfenestrindane can also undergo the fourfold Scholl&#8208;type cyclization process and can be transformed into the parent saddle hydrocarbon.

      <title>Novel fluorescently labelled ATP analogues for direct monitoring of ubiquitin activation</title>
      <dc:description>Simple and robust assays to monitor enzymatic ATP cleavage with high efficiency in real&#8208;time are scarce. To address this shortcoming, we developed novel fluorescently labelled adenosine tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and pentaphosphate analogues of ATP. The novel ATP analogues bear &#8211; in contrast to earlier reports &#8211; only a single acridone&#8208;based dye at the terminal phosphate group. The dye&#8217;s fluorescence is quenched by the adenine component of the ATP analogue and is restored upon cleavage of the phosphate chain and dissociation of the dye from the adenosine moiety. Thereby the activity of ATP cleaving enzymes can be followed in real&#8208;time. We demonstrate this proficiency for ubiquitin activation by the ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzymes UBA1 and UBA6 which represents the first step in an enzymatic cascade leading to the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, a process that is highly conserved from yeast to humans. We found that the efficiency to serve as cofactor for UBA1/UBA6 very much depends on the length of the phosphate chain of the ATP analogue: triphosphates are used poorly while pentaphosphates are most efficiently processed. Notably, the novel pentaphosphate&#8208;harbouring ATP analogue supersedes the efficiency of recently reported dual&#8208;dye labelled analogues and thus, is a promising candidate for broad applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Pseudo&#8208;Isocyanine Chloride as a Sensor for Macromolecular Crowding in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;isocyanine chloride (PIC) is a dyestuff which self&#8208;assembles in aqueous solution, thereby showing a characteristic and sharp absorption band as well as a fluorescence band at a wavelength of 573 nm. Based on this unique feature, a synthetic model system was developed, suitable to analyse self&#8208;assembly in various environments like macromolecular crowding. First, Triethylene glycol (TEG), polyethylene glycol (PEG), Ficoll 400 as a highly branched polysaccharide and sucrose corresponding to the monomeric unit of Ficoll were used as potential crowders. Combined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and time&#8208;resolved light scattering revealed a strong impact of crowding based on excluded volume effects only for Ficoll 400. Sucrose had hardly any influence on the self&#8208;assembly of PIC and PEG and TEG impeded the PIC self&#8208;assembly. Finally, HeLa cells were infiltrated with PIC solutions well below the aggregation threshold in the infiltrating solution. In the cellular environment, PIC was exposed to a significant crowding and immediately started to aggregate. As was demonstrated by fluorescence imaging, the extent of aggregation could be modulated by exposing the cells to salt&#8208;induced osmotic stress. The results suggest future use of such a system as a sensor for the analysis of in vitro and in vivo crowding effects on self&#8208;assembly processes.</dc:description>

First, Triethylene glycol (TEG), polyethylene glycol (PEG), Ficoll 400 as a highly branched polysaccharide and sucrose corresponding to the monomeric unit of Ficoll were used as potential crowders. Combined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and time&#8208;resolved light scattering revealed a strong impact of crowding based on excluded volume effects only for Ficoll 400. Sucrose had hardly any influence on the self&#8208;assembly of PIC and PEG and TEG impeded the PIC self&#8208;assembly. Finally, HeLa cells were infiltrated with PIC solutions well below the aggregation threshold in the infiltrating solution. In the cellular environment, PIC was exposed to a significant crowding and immediately started to aggregate. As was demonstrated by fluorescence imaging, the extent of aggregation could be modulated by exposing the cells to salt&#8208;induced osmotic stress. The results suggest future use of such a system as a sensor for the analysis of in vitro and in vivo crowding effects on self&#8208;assembly processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Benzynes were selectively generated in situ from phenols and trapped regioselectively with potassium hexamethyldisilazide to form primary anilines following acidic workup. The direct conversion of a phenolic hydroxyl group into a free amino group is a useful method for the preparation of primary aryl amines that are hard to synthesize by using coupling reactions involving phenol derivatives with ammonia. Whereas reactions of ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted phenols produced meta&#8208;substituted anilines exclusively, those of para&#8208;substituted phenols provided ortho&#8208;silylanilines.

      <title>UV/VIS spectroscopy of Copper Formate Clusters: Insight into Metal&#8208;Ligand Photochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The electronic structure and the photochemistry of copper formate clusters Cu(I)2(HCO2)3&#8211; and Cu(II)n(HCO2)2n+1&#8211;, n&#160;&#8804;&#160;8, are investigated in the gas phase using UV/Vis spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations. A clear difference in the spectra of clusters with Cu(I) and Cu(II) copper ions is observed. For the Cu(I) species, transitions between copper d and s/p orbitals are recorded. For stoichiometric Cu(II) formate clusters, the spectra are dominated by copper d&#8208;d transitions and charge transfer excitations from formate to the vacant copper d orbital. Calculations reveal the existence of several energetically low&#8208;lying isomers, and the energetic position of the electronic transitions depends strongly on the specific isomer. The oxidation state of the copper centers governs the photochemistry. In Cu(II)(HCO2)3&#8211;, fast internal conversion into the electronic ground state is observed, leading to statistical dissociation; for charge transfer excitations, specific excited state reaction channels are observed in addition, like formyl radical loss. In Cu(I)2(HCO2)3&#8211;, the system relaxes to a local minimum on an excited state potential energy surface and might undergo fluorescence or reach a conical intersection to the ground state, in both cases providing substantial energy for statistical decomposition. Alternatively, a Cu(II)(HCO2)3Cu(0)&#8211; biradical structure is formed in the excited state, which gives rise to the photochemical loss of a neutral copper atom.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced H&#8208;Aggregation for Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On of the GFP Chromophore: Supramolecular Structural Rigidity</title>
      <dc:description>To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f = 2.9 vs 0.02%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced&#160;fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To turn on the fluorescence of the native green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore HBDI in an artificial supramolecular system has been a challenging task, because it requires high local environmental rigidity. This work shows that the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of an HBDI&#8208;containing organogelator results in two orders of magnitude fluorescence enhancement (&#934;f = 2.9 vs 0.02%), in which the inter&#8208;HBDI OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;OH H&#8208;bonds play a crucial role. The aggregation&#8208;induced&#160;fluorescence enhancement of HBDI has important implications on the origin of the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of HBDI in the GFP &#946;&#8208;barrel and on the supramolecular strategy for a full fluorescence recovery of HBDI. These results reveal a new approach to designing rigid chromophore aggregates for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Long&#8208;Lived Photocharges in Supramoelcular Polymers of Low&#8208;Bandgap Chromophores</title>
      <dc:description>Photoinduced charge separation in supramolecular aggregates of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules is a fundamental photophysical process, and a key criterion for the development of advanced organic electronics materials. Here, we report on the self&#8208;assembly of novel low&#8208;bandgap chromophores into helical one&#8208;dimensional aggregates due to intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding. The chromophores confined in these supramolecular polymers show strong excitonic coupling interactions and give rise to charge&#8208;separated states with unusually long lifetimes of several hours and charge densities of up to 5 mol% after illumination with white light. Two&#8208;contact devices exhibit increased photoconductivity and can even show Ohmic behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the confinement of organic semiconductors into one&#8208;dimensional aggregates results in a considerable stabilization of charge carriers for a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, which may have implications for the design of future organic electronic materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The use of organometallic triplet emitters in OLEDs is motivated by the premise of efficient intersystem crossing leading to unit internal quantum efficiencies. However, since most devices are based on solid&#8208;state components, an inherent limitation to square planar platinum(II) phosphors is their tendency toward aggregation&#8208;based quenching. &#160;We introduce a new class of emissive, four&#8208;coordinate Pt(II) species based on the bisimidazolyl carbazolide (BIMCA) ligand that display highly efficient, long&#8208;lived solid&#8208;state phosphorescence at room temperature. As examples, a set of four BIMCAPt phenyl acetylides are synthesized that emit in the green (l  max  = 507&#8208;540 nm) with &gt;60% quantum yield and millisecond lifetimes. The structures of the resulting species reveal a non&#8208;planar structure imposed by steric clashes between BIMCA and the iodo or alkynyl coligand. Ground&#8208;state and photophysical characterization are presented. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate that the BIMCA ligand dominates the frontier orbitals along with the first Franck&#8208;Condon singlet and triplet excited states.</dc:description>

      <title>Optically triggered control of the charge carrier density  in chemically functionalized graphene field effect transistors</title>
      <dc:description>Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials are of great interest for applications in ultrathin electronic and sensing devices. Here we demonstrate the possibility to add optical switchability to graphene FETs (GFET) by functionalizing the graphene channel with optically switchable azobenzene molecules. The azobenzene molecules were incorporated to the GFET channel by building a van der Waals heterostructure with a carbon nanomembrane (CNM), which is used as a molecular interposer to attach the azobenzene molecules. Under exposure with 365 nm and 455 nm light, azobenzene molecules undergo  cis  and  trans  molecular conformations, respectively, resulting in a switching of the molecular dipole moment. Thus, the effective electric field acting on the GFET channel is tuned by optical stimulation and the carrier density is modulated.</dc:description>

N,N&#8242;&#8208;Ethylene bridged bis&#8208;2&#8208;aryl pyrrolinium cations are reported in this work, which (a)&#8197;undergo stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron reduction coupled two hydrogen transfer to form E&#8208;diaminoalkenes; and (b)&#8197;have non identical pathways for reduction and oxidation.







Abstract
This work presents a stepwise reversible two&#8208;electron transfer induced hydrogen shift leading to the conversion of a bis&#8208;pyrrolinium cation to an E&#8208;diaminoalkene and vice versa. Remarkably, the forward and the reverse reaction, which are both reversible, follow two completely different reaction pathways. Establishing such unprecedented property in this type of processes was possible by developing a novel synthetic route towards the starting dication. All intermediates involved in both the forward and the backward reactions were comprehensively characterized by a combination of spectroscopic, crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and theoretical methods. The presented synthetic route opens up new possibilities for the generation of multi&#8208;pyrrolinium cation scaffold&#8208;based organic redox systems, which constitute decidedly sought&#8208;after molecules in contemporary chemistry.

      <title>Luminescence&#8208;Driven Electronic Structure Determination in a Textbook Dimeric DyIII&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
      <dc:description>
Shine on: A dysprosium dinuclear complex textbook example is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of crystal field theory. This historical theory coupled with Boltzmann population allows the extraction of the energy spectrum of the ground state multiplet from luminescence that is used to model the magnetic properties.







Abstract
A textbook dysprosium dinuclear complex based on acetylacetone ligands, [Dy2(acac)4(&#956;2&#8208;acac)2(H2O)2], has been synthesized and fully characterized. This simple dimeric lanthanide complex shows well&#8208;resolved solid&#8208;state luminescence and behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet under zero DC field. A seminal crystal&#8208;field approach is used to marry both magnetism and luminescence in the frame of an energetic picture.

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent Seeding as a Strategy for Fabrication of Densely Packed SURMOF Layers</title>
      <dc:description>The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) method is a well&#8208;established method for the growth of surface&#8208;attached metal&#8208;organic frameworks (SURMOFs). Various experimental parameters, like surface functionalization or temperature, have been identified as essential in the past. In this study, inspired by these recent insights regarding the LbL SURMOF growth mechanism, we investigated the impact of reactant solutions concentration on LbL growth of the Cu2(F4bdc)2 (dabco) SURMOF (F4bdc2&#8208; = tetrafluorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate and dabco = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octane) in situ using quartz&#8208;crystal microbalance and ex situ with a combination of spectroscopic, diffraction and microscopy techniques. It was found that number, size and morphology of MOF crystallites are strongly influenced by the reagent concentration. By adjusting the interplay of nucleation and growth, we were able to produce densely packed, yet thin films, which are highly desired for a variety of SURMOF applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Control over the Aspect Ratio of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Recent developments in kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization permit control of the size (length and area) of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. However, control of molecular self&#8208;assembly at a level comparable with organic synthetic chemistry and the achievement of structural complexity at a hierarchy larger than the molecular level remain challenging. In this study, we focus on controlling the aspect ratio of supramolecular nanosheets. A systematic understanding of the relationship between the monomer structure and the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape has derived a new monomer capable of forming supramolecular nanosheets. Having this monomer in hand, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of a supramolecular nanosheet can be controlled by modulating intermolecular interactions in two dimensions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Selective C&#8211;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence. This sequence consists of three processes: (1) interrupted Pummerer reaction to form S&#8211;O&#8208;tethered sulfonium salt, (2) C&#8211;C&#8208;forming [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization, and (3) Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The present biaryl construction provides a facile access to polyfluorinated biaryls that is difficult to synthesize by other methods. The synthetic utility of the strategy is clearly demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost, a potassium channel modulator.</dc:description>

For comparison, a series of  PTZ  derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) (cyano &#8208;CN and formyl &#8208;CHO) and electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) (methoxy &#8208;OMe) group at C3&#8208;position were designed and synthesized.

Computational approaches unveil that for  PTZ  and  PTZ&#8208;OMe  , the transitions are from HOMOs dominated by &#960; orbitals to LUMOs of sulphur nonbonding&#8208;mixed &#960;* orbitals, and hence are partially forbidden. On the contrary, the EWGs lower the energy level of lone pair electrons on the sulphur atom, suppressing the mixing of nonbonding orbital with &#960;* in LUMO such that the allowed &#960;&#960;* transition becomes dominant. This work thus demonstrates a judicious chemical design to fine&#8208;tune the transition character in  PTZ  analogues, making  PTZ&#8208;NO  2  attains unity emission quantum yield in nonpolar solvents.</dc:description>

      <title>Functionalization of Piperidine Derivatives for the Site&#8208;Selective and Stereoselective Synthesis of Positional Analogues of Methylphenidate</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention, please: Regio, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 functionalization on piperidine ring controlled by catalysts and protecting groups has been employed for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate (Ritalin).







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertions and cyclopropanations of donor/acceptor carbenes have been used for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate. The site selectivity is controlled by the catalyst and the amine protecting group. C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TCPTAD)4, or N&#8208;brosyl&#8208;piperidine using Rh2(R&#8208;TPPTTL)4 generated 2&#8208;substitited analogues. In contrast, when N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;oxoarylacetyl&#8208;piperidines were used in combination with Rh2(S&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;BrTPCP)4, the C&#8722;H functionalization produced 4&#8208;susbstiuted analogues. Finally, the 3&#8208;substituted analogues were prepared indirectly by cyclopropanation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;tetrahydropyridine followed by reductive regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attention, please&lt;/b&gt;: Regio, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 functionalization on piperidine ring controlled by catalysts and protecting groups has been employed for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate (Ritalin).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertions and cyclopropanations of donor/acceptor carbenes have been used for the synthesis of positional analogues of methylphenidate. The site selectivity is controlled by the catalyst and the amine protecting group. C&#8722;H functionalization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine using Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;TCPTAD)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;brosyl&#8208;piperidine using Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;TPPTTL)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generated 2&#8208;substitited analogues. In contrast, when &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;oxoarylacetyl&#8208;piperidines were used in combination with Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;BrTPCP)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the C&#8722;H functionalization produced 4&#8208;susbstiuted analogues. Finally, the 3&#8208;substituted analogues were prepared indirectly by cyclopropanation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Boc&#8208;tetrahydropyridine followed by reductive regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalyzed by Ru Nanocatalysts: Labelling of Complex Molecules Containing N&#8208;Heterocycles and Reaction Mechanism Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D2 or T2 gas as isotopic sources. In terms of application, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms allows the synthesis of deuterated internal standards for LC/MS quantification and the efficacy of the catalytic process permits the preparation of complex radiolabelled drugs owning high specific activities by using a subatmospheric pressure of T2 gas.







Abstract
Ruthenium nanocatalysis can provide effective deuteration and tritiation of oxazole, imidazole, triazole and carbazole substructures in complex molecules using D2 or T2 gas as isotopic sources. Depending on the substructure considered, this approach does not only represent a significant step forward in practice, with notably higher isotope uptakes, a broader substrate scope and a higher solvent applicability compared to existing procedures, but also the unique way to label important heterocycles using hydrogen isotope exchange. In terms of applications, the high incorporation of deuterium atoms, allows the synthesis of internal standards for LC&#8208;MS quantification. Moreover, the efficacy of the catalyst permits, even under subatmospheric pressure of T2 gas, the preparation of complex radiolabeled drugs owning high molar activities. From a fundamental point of view, a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic study identifying undisclosed key intermediates, allowed a deeper understanding of C&#8722;H (and N&#8722;H) activation processes occurring at the surface of metallic nanoclusters.

      <title>Radical C&#8722;N Borylation of Aromatic Amines Enabled by a Pyrylium Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>
A radical borylation of aromatic amines through a homolytic C(sp2)&#8722;N bond cleavage is presented. This method capitalizes on a simple and mild activation via a pyrylium reagent (ScPyry&#8208;OTf) that primes the amino group for reactivity. The combination of terpyridine and a diboron reagent triggers a radical reaction which cleaves the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond and forges a new C(sp2)&#8722;B bond. The non&#8208;planar structure of the pyridinium, provides the necessary driving force for the challenging aryl radical formation.

      <title>Optical Control of Cytokine Production Using Photoswitchable Galactosylceramides</title>
      <dc:description>
A new direction in photoimmunotherapy: The synthesis and biological evaluation of photochromic derivatives of the &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide KRN&#8208;7000 are reported. The photolipid &#945;&#8208;GalACer&#8208;4 proved to be more potent than KRN&#8208;7000 itself when activated with 370&#8197;nm light (see scheme).







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramides are glycosphingolipids that show promise in cancer immunotherapy. After presentation by CD1d, they activate natural killer T cells (NKT), which results in the production of a variety of pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of photochromic derivatives of KRN&#8208;7000, the activity of which can be modulated with light. Based on established structure&#8211;activity relationships, we designed photoswitchable analogues of this glycolipid that control the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN&#8208;&#947;. The azobenzene derivative &#945;&#8208;GalACer&#8208;4 proved to be more potent than KRN&#8208;7000 itself when activated with 370&#8197;nm light. Photolipids of this type could improve our mechanistic understanding of cytokine production and could open new directions in photoimmunotherapy.

      <title>Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling between Phenols and &#946;&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Facile Construction of Benzofurans</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrifying: A mild electrochemical system was developed for the preparation of benzofurans through cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This method has good functional&#8208;group compatibility and can serve as a powerful synthetic tool with high synthetic value.







Abstract
Preparative electrochemical synthesis is an ideal method for establishing green, sustainable processes. The major benefits of an electro&#8208;organic strategy over that of conventional chemical synthesis are the avoidance of reagent waste and mild reaction conditions. Here, an intermolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between phenols and &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been developed to build various benzofurans under undivided electrolytic conditions. Neither transition metals nor external chemical oxidants are required to facilitate the dehydrogenation and dehydration processes. The key factor in success was the use of nBu4NBF4 as the electrolyte and hexafluoroisopropanol as the solvent, which play key roles in the cyclocondensation step. This electrolysis is scalable and can be used as a key step in drug synthesis. On the basis of several experimental results, the mechanism, particularly of the remarkable anodic oxidation and cyclization process, was illustrated.

      <title>Amino&#8208;Induced 2D Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Aerobic Oxidation of Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure tuning: With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of an o&#8208;amino group, a coordination structure was tuned from a metal&#8211;organic pholyhedron to a 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA, AIA=2&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid) shows high catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of olefins under air atmosphere.







Abstract
With the assistance of hydrogen bonds of the o&#8208;amino group, we have successfully tuned a coordination structure from a metal&#8211;organic polyhedron (MOP) to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups, and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA) has been applied as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the aerobic epoxidation of olefins by using air as oxygen source. Without the aggregation problem of active sites in MOPs, Cu&#8208;AIA possesses much higher reactivity than MOP&#8208;1. Furthermore, the amino group of the framework has been used as a modifiable site through post&#8208;synthetic metalation (PSMet) to prepare a 2D MOF&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalyst, which shows excellent catalytic performance for the Suzuki reaction. It indicates that Cu&#8208;AIA can also work as a good 2D MOF carrier for the derivation of other heterogeneous catalysts.

The amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the two vicinal carboxylic groups, and induces the ligand to coordinate with copper ions to form the 2D structure. The obtained 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;AIA) has been applied as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the aerobic epoxidation of olefins by using air as oxygen source. Without the aggregation problem of active sites in MOPs, Cu&#8208;AIA possesses much higher reactivity than MOP&#8208;1. Furthermore, the amino group of the framework has been used as a modifiable site through post&#8208;synthetic metalation (PSMet) to prepare a 2D MOF&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalyst, which shows excellent catalytic performance for the Suzuki reaction. It indicates that Cu&#8208;AIA can also work as a good 2D MOF carrier for the derivation of other heterogeneous catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solvent Impact on the Properties of Benchmark Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Synthesis of CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks: CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 were synthesized by utilizing acetonitrile as the solvent. The typical breathing behavior of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 upon guest molecule adsorption was inhibited by a high concentration of defects. As shown by NMR spectroscopy these consist of noncoordinated &#8722;COOH groups. Breathing could be enforced by applying a pressure of about 60&#8197;MPa during mercury intrusion.







Abstract
Herein is reported the utilization of acetonitrile as a new solvent for the synthesis of the three significantly different benchmark metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) CAU&#8208;10, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, and Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 of idealized composition [Al(OH)(ISO)], [Ce6O4(OH)4(BDC)6], and [Al(OH)(BDC)], respectively (ISO2&#8722;: isophthalate, BDC2&#8722;: terephthalate). Its use allowed the synthesis of Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 on a gram scale. While CAU&#8208;10 and Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 exhibit properties similar to those reported elsewhere for these two materials, the obtained Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 shows no structural flexibility upon adsorption of hydrophilic or hydrophobic guest molecules such as water and xenon and is stabilized in its large&#8208;pore form over a broad temperature range (130&#8211;450&#8197;K). The stabilization of the large&#8208;pore form of Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 was attributed to a high percentage of noncoordinating &#8722;COOH groups as determined by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The defective material shows an unusually high water uptake of 310&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the range of 0.45 to 0.65&#8197;p/p&#176;. In spite of showing no breathing effect upon water adsorption it exhibits distinct mechanical properties. Thus, mercury intrusion porosimetry studies revealed that the solid can be reversibly forced to breathe by applying moderate pressures (&#8776;60&#8197;MPa).

      <title>Structural Investigation of Hybrid Peptide Foldamers Composed of &#945;&#8208;Dipeptide Equivalent &#946;&#8208;Oxy&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
Peptide mimics: Conformational properties of peptides composed of new &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids are studied as dipeptide surrogates both in solution and as single crystals. Structural analysis suggests that the &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;&#948;&#8208;amino acids can be accommodated into helices without significant deviation in the overall helical folding (see figure).







Abstract
Due to their equivalent lengths, &#948;&#8208;amino acids can serve as surrogates of &#945;&#8208;dipeptides. However, &#948;&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains have not been well studied because of synthetic difficulties and because of their insolubility in organic solvents. Recently we reported the spontaneous supramolecular gelation of &#948;&#8208;peptides composed of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. Here, we report the incorporation of &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids as guests into the host &#945;&#8208;helix, &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide 12&#8208;helix and their single&#8208;crystal conformations. In addition, we studied the solution conformations of hybrid peptides composed of 1:1 alternating &#945; and &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids. In contrast to the control &#945;&#8208;helix structures, the crystal structure of peptides with &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids exhibit &#945;&#8208;helical conformations consisting of both 13&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered H&#8208;bonds. The &#945;,&#948;&#8208;hybrid peptide adopted mixed 13/11&#8208;helix conformation in solution with alternating H&#8208;bond directionality. Crystal&#8208;structure analysis revealed that the &#945;,&#947;4&#8208;hybrid peptide accommodated the guest &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acid without significant deviation to the overall helix folding. The results reported here emphasize that &#946;(O)&#8208;&#948;5&#8208;amino acids with proteinogenic side chains can be accommodated into regular &#945;&#8208;helix or 12&#8208;helix as guests without much deviation of the overall helix folding of the peptides.

      <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red Electrophosphorescent Iridium(III) Complexes Based on Optimizing Ancillary Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Mind the gap: A HOMO energy&#8208;level regulation strategy of modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligand is proposed with the aim of developing pure&#8208;red emission materials, with spectra mainly covering the region from &#955;=600 to 700&#8197;nm.

Abstract
Two new iridium(III) complexes were synthesized by introducing two trifluoromethyl groups into an ancillary ligand to develop pure&#8208;red emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electron&#8208;donating ability of the ancillary ligands is suppressed, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups, which can reduce the HOMO energy levels compared with those of compounds without trifluoromethyl groups. However, the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into the ancillary ligand has little impact on the LUMO energy levels. Therefore, a well&#8208;tuned, pure&#8208;red, excited&#8208;state energy was achieved by regulating the relative energy level between the HOMO and LUMO. OLEDs with these complexes as emitters showed high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26&#8201;% and realized high EQEs of about 25&#8201;% and fairly low driving voltages of 3.3&#8211;3.6&#8197;V for practical luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, as well as excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.66, 0.33) and (0.67, 0.33); thus, this demonstrates the successful molecular design strategy by modifying the electron&#8208;donating ability of ancillary ligand.

Coordinating ability indices (CAI) rank such species according to their affinity to three families of metals: transition metals, lanthanides and s&#8208;block metals. After a brief review of recent applications to a variety of fields (synthesis, catalysis, nanochemistry, electrochemistry.), a new extended set of CAI is presented and discussed.







Abstract
After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s&#8208;block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)&#8197;the charge of an anion, (b)&#8197;the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)&#8197;the degree of protonation of oxo&#8208;anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)&#8197;the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes. Hit parades of solvents and anions most commonly used in the areas of transition metal, s&#8208;block and lanthanide chemistry are deduced from the statistics of their presence in crystal structures.

      <title>Is There a Single Ideal Parameter for Halogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Based Lewis Acidity?</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspecting halogen bonding: Is it possible to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strength accurately by a single DFT calculation and achieve better performance than that offered by the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth?







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bond donors (halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids) have now found various applications in diverse fields of chemistry. The goal of this study was to identify a parameter obtainable from a single DFT calculation that reliably describes halogen&#8208;bonding strength (Lewis acidity). First, several DFT methods were benchmarked against the CCSD(T) CBS binding data of complexes of 17 carbon&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donors with chloride and ammonia as representative Lewis bases, which revealed M05&#8208;2X with a partially augmented def2&#8208;TZVP(D) basis set as the best model chemistry. The best single parameter to predict halogen&#8208;bonding strengths was the static &#963;&#8208;hole depth, but it still provided inaccurate predictions for a series of compounds. Thus, a more reliable parameter, &#937;&#963;*, has been developed through the linear combination of the &#963;&#8208;hole depth and the &#963;*(C&#8722;I) energy, which was further validated against neutral, cationic, halogen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donors with very good performance.

      <title>Gas&#8211;Solid Heterogeneous Postsynthetic Modification of Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Click! Postsynthetic functionalization of imine&#8208;based COFs is carried out at the solid&#8211;gas (COF&#8211;azide) interface, without solvent and catalyst, in high yield. This procedure is a green postsynthetic modification of COFs and allows for the preparation of 2D materials with high potential for the development of new applications.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reaction is among the most extensively used strategies for the post&#8208;polymerization modification of COFs. This work shows a new procedure for the postsynthetic functionalization of imine&#8208;based COFs by using a heterogeneous solid&#8211;gas reaction between alkyne&#8208;functionalized COFs and azides in the absence of a copper catalyst. This new alternative represents a step forward towards a greener postsynthetic modification of COFs opening a high potential for the development of new applications.

      <title>Cyclometalated Ruthenium Pincer Complexes as Catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones with Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkylation with ruthenium: Eight new Ru pincer complexes were prepared by introduction of C,N&#8208;bound phenyl heterocycle ligands. These complexes were applied as catalysts in the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols through hydrogen autotransfer. Here, superior yields in comparison to [RuHCl(CO)(HN(CH2CH2PPh2)2)] (Ru&#8208;MACHO) were achieved and 21 different alkylated ketones were synthesized in up to 97&#8201;% yield. Moreover, investigations regarding the catalyst species present during the reaction were conducted.







Abstract
Ruthenium PNP pincer complexes bearing supplementary cyclometalated C,N&#8208;bound ligands have been prepared and fully characterized for the first time. By replacing CO and H&#8722; as ancillary ligands in such complexes, additional electronic and steric modifications of this topical class of catalysts are possible. The advantages of the new catalysts are demonstrated in the general &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols following a hydrogen autotransfer protocol. Herein, various aliphatic and benzylic alcohols were applied as green alkylating agents for ketones bearing aromatic, heteroaromatic or aliphatic substituents as well as cyclic ones. Mechanistic investigations revealed that during catalysis, Ru carboxylate complexes are predominantly formed whereas neither the PNP nor the CN ligand are released from the catalyst in significant amounts.

      <title>Metallation&#8208;Induced Heterogeneous Dynamics of DNA Revealed by Single&#8208;Molecule FRET</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic complexity: The metallation of DNA by an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex is studied using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), revealing dynamic heterogeneity that is obscured at the ensemble level.







Abstract
The metallation of nucleic acids is key to wide&#8208;ranging applications, from anticancer medicine to nanomaterials, yet there is a lack of understanding of the molecular&#8208;level effects of metallation. Here, we apply single&#8208;molecule fluorescence methods to study the reaction of an organo&#8208;osmium anticancer complex and DNA. Individual metallated DNA hairpins are characterised using F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although ensemble measurements suggest a simple two&#8208;state system, single&#8208;molecule experiments reveal an underlying heterogeneity in the oligonucleotide dynamics, attributable to different degrees of metallation of the GC&#8208;rich hairpin stem. Metallated hairpins display fast two&#8208;state transitions with a two&#8208;fold increase in the opening rate to &#8776;2&#8197;s&#8722;1, relative to the unmodified hairpin, and relatively static conformations with long&#8208;lived open (and closed) states of 5 to &#8805;50&#8197;s. These studies show that a single&#8208;molecule approach can provide new insight into metallation&#8208;induced changes in DNA structure and dynamics.

      <title>Synthesis of the 8,19&#8208;Epoxysteroid Eurysterol&#8197;A</title>
      <dc:description>
From an animal sterol to a bioactive marine natural product: The first synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal sulfated sterol with a unique 8,19&#8208;epoxy bridge spanning ring&#8197;B, was elaborated exploiting an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report the first chemical synthesis of eurysterol&#8197;A, a cytotoxic and antifungal marine steroidal sulfate with a unique C8&#8722;C19 oxy&#8208;bridged cholestane skeleton. After C19 hydroxylation of cholesteryl acetate, used as an inexpensive commercial starting material, the challenging oxidative functionalization of ring&#8197;B was achieved by two different routes to set up a 5&#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one moiety. As a key step, an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was exploited to close the oxy&#8208;bridge (8&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy unit). DFT calculations show this reversible transformation being exergonic by about &#8722;30&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Along the optimized (scalable) synthetic sequence, the target natural product was obtained in only 11&#8197;steps in 5&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, an access to (isomeric) 7&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy steroids with a previously unknown pentacyclic ring system was discovered.

DFT calculations show this reversible transformation being exergonic by about &#8722;30&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Along the optimized (scalable) synthetic sequence, the target natural product was obtained in only 11&#8197;steps in 5&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, an access to (isomeric) 7&#946;,19&#8208;epoxy steroids with a previously unknown pentacyclic ring system was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tetraammineplatinum(II) and Tetraamminepalladium(II) Chromates as Precursors of Metal Oxide Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and the thermal decomposition mechanisms of precursors in different atmospheres were studied. The catalytic properties of bimetallic Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 were compared with those of monometallic Pt and Pd in CO total oxidation and preferential oxidation in excess hydrogen processes.







Abstract
[M(NH3)4]A (M=Pt, Pd; A=CrO4, Cr2O7) and [Pt(NH3)4(NO2)(Cr2O7)]NO3 complex salts were synthesized and characterized by a number of physicochemical methods of analysis (IR, single&#8208;crystal and powder XRD, and simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry with evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry). Thermolysis of the salts obtained in a hydrogen atmosphere proceeds with the partial reduction of chromium to a metallic state and the formation of MxCr1&#8722;x (M=Pt, Pd) metal solid solution with a chromium content of up to 22&#8197;at&#8201;% and chromium(III) oxide. The thermal decomposition of salts in an inert and oxidizing atmosphere passes through the formation stage of the MCrO2 phase with the delafossite structure followed by its subsequent decomposition into chromium(III) oxide and noble metal. Nanosized Pt&#8722;Cr2O3 and Pd&#8722;Cr2O3 composites obtained by the thermolysis of precursor salts in air at 500&#8201;&#176;C and being held at this temperature for 1&#8197;h showed a high catalytic activity in the CO total oxidation (TOX) and preferential oxidation in the excess of hydrogen (PROX) processes compared with that of monometallic Pt and Pd powders.

      <title>Increasing Complexity: A Practical Synthetic Approach to Three&#8208;Dimensional, Cyclic Sulfoximines and First Insights into Their in Vitro Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Practical and safe: An underrepresented structural motif in the life sciences is now accessible by a practical and safe synthetic approach. Five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in two to three steps in high yields and broad scope (17 examples). In vitro evaluation of properties relevant to medicinal chemistry of these three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for drug discovery.







Abstract
A short synthetic approach with broad scope to access five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic sulfoximines in only two to three steps from readily available thiophenols is reported. Thus, simple building blocks were converted to complex molecular structures by a sequence of S&#8208;alkylation and one&#8208;pot sulfoximine formation, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Seventeen structurally diverse cyclic sulfoximines were prepared in high overall yields. In vitro evaluation of these underrepresented, three&#8208;dimensional, cyclic sulfoximines with respect to properties relevant to medicinal chemistry did not reveal any intrinsic flaw for application in drug discovery.

By taking advantage of the crystal phase dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures were synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step colloidal method, and the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor exhibited much improved sensing performance due to the formation of p&#8211;n hetero&#8208;junctions.







Abstract
The formation of semiconductor heterostructures is an effective approach to achieve high performance in electrical gas sensing. However, such heterostructures are usually prepared via multi&#8208;step procedures. In this contribution, by taking advantage of the crystal phase&#8208;dependent electronic property of SnSex based materials, we report a one&#8208;step colloid method for the preparation of SnSe(x%)/SnSe2(100&#8722;x%) p&#8211;n heterostructures, with x &#8776;30, 50, and 70. The obtained materials with solution processability were successfully fabricated into NO2 sensors. Among them, the SnSe(50&#8201;%)/SnSe2(50&#8201;%) based sensor with an active layer thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m exhibited the highest sensitivity to NO2 (30&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;ppm) with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 69&#8197;ppb at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). This was mainly attributed to the formation of p&#8211;n junctions that allowed for gas&#8208;induced modification of the junction barriers. Under 405&#8197;nm laser illumination, the sensor performance was further enhanced, exhibiting a 3.5&#8197;times increased response toward 0.1&#8197;ppm NO2, along with a recovery time of 4.6&#8197;min.

      <title>Exciton Interactions, Excimer Formation, and [2&#960;+2&#960;] Photodimerization in Nonconjugated Curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Folding chromophores: A series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes has been synthesized. The compounds display solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission as a result of a folding process controlling intramolecular chromophore aggregation. An in&#8208;depth investigation of their photophysical properties allowed a complex kinetic scheme to be established and provided a rationale for the formation of the first example of photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of a series of covalently linked dimers of quadrupolar curcuminoid&#8208;BF2 dyes and the detailed investigation of their solvent&#8208;dependent spectroscopic and photophysical properties. In solvents of low polarity, intramolecular folding induces the formation of aggregated chromophores, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of which display the optical signature characteristic of weakly&#8208;coupled H&#8208;aggregates. The extent of folding and, in turn, of ground&#8208;state aggregation is strongly dependent on the nature of the flexible linker. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopies show that the Frenkel exciton relaxes into a fluorescent symmetrical excimer state with a long lifetime. Furthermore, our in&#8208;depth studies show that a weakly emitting excimer lies on the pathway toward a photocyclomer. Two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) allowed the structure of the photoproduct to be established. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a [2&#960;+2&#960;] photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.

In solvents of low polarity, intramolecular folding induces the formation of aggregated chromophores, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of which display the optical signature characteristic of weakly&#8208;coupled H&#8208;aggregates. The extent of folding and, in turn, of ground&#8208;state aggregation is strongly dependent on the nature of the flexible linker. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopies show that the Frenkel exciton relaxes into a fluorescent symmetrical excimer state with a long lifetime. Furthermore, our in&#8208;depth studies show that a weakly emitting excimer lies on the pathway toward a photocyclomer. Two&#8208;dimensional &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) allowed the structure of the photoproduct to be established. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a [2&#960;+2&#960;] photodimerization of the curcuminoid chromophore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bimodal Heterogeneous Functionality in Redox&#8208;Active Conjugated Microporous Polymer toward Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Bifunctional catalyst: Bimodal functionality toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photochemical H2 evolution of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) is explored. Tuning of the side&#8208;chain substitutions on oligo&#8208;(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene bola&#8208;amphiphilic struts shows distinct nanostructuring in CMPs, which has a high impact on catalytic performances.







Abstract
The designing and development of heterogeneous catalysts for conversion of renewable energy to chemical energies by electrochemical as well as photochemical processes is at the forefront of energy research. In this work, two new donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based redox&#8208;active conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;mix and TAPA&#8208;OPE&#8208;gly) are synthesized through Schiff base condensation reaction using a microwave synthesizer. Notably, the asymmetric and symmetric bola&#8208;amphiphilic nature of the OPE struts results in distinct nanostructuring and morphologies in the CMPs. Interestingly, both CMPs show impressive heterogeneous catalytic activity toward electrochemical O2 reduction and photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions, and therefore, act as bimodal electro&#8208; and photocatalytic porous organic materials. Furthermore, the redox&#8208;active property of the CMPs is exploited for in&#8197;situ generation and stabilization of platinum nanoparticles (Pt), and these Pt@CMPs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.

      <title>Dual Emission from Precious Metal&#8208;Free Luminophores Consisting of C, H, O, Si, and S/P at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Ratiometric sensors: Dual emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence with comparable intensities is achieved with 1,4&#8208;disiloxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(acceptor)benzenes, in which arylsulfonyl and diarylphosphinyl groups are installed as acceptors. The dual&#8208;luminescent benzene derivatives allowed the performance of ratiometric luminescence sensing of temperature and molecular oxygen with high accuracy.







Abstract
Fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emissive compounds are valuable tools for ratiometric luminescence sensing. Herein, it is reported that 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;bis[bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphinyl]&#8208;1,4&#8208;disiloxybenzenes exhibit dual emission with emission peaks that were easily identified without performing time&#8208;gated measurement. The disiloxybenzenes in powder simultaneously fluoresced and phosphoresced at 358&#8211;374 and 457&#8211;470&#8197;nm, respectively, under vacuum. The intensity ratios of the phosphorescence/fluorescence maxima of the disiloxybenzenes in powder and in a thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate) were sensitive to temperature and molecular oxygen, respectively. The plots of the relative intensity versus temperature or partial pressure of molecular oxygen were well fitted with calibration curves defined by an exponential approximation with excellent correlation coefficients R2 (0.9708&#8211;0.9921), demonstrating the high potential of the disiloxybenzenes as precious metal&#8208;free probes applicable to ratiometric luminescence sensing.

      <title>Carbon&#8211;Phosphorus Coupling from C^N Cyclometalated AuIII Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Go for P: C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes were discovered to readily react with phosphines under mild conditions to afford phosphoniums. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and DFT calculations provide insight into this rare AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
With the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report here on the AuIII&#8208;mediated Caryl&#8722;P bond formation occurring upon reaction of C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes with phosphines. The [Au(C^N)Cl2] complex&#8197;1 featuring the bidentate 2&#8208;benzoylpyridine (CCON) scaffold was found to react with PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) under mild conditions, including in water, to afford the corresponding phosphonium&#8197;5 through C&#8722;P reductive elimination. A mechanism is proposed for the title reaction based on in situ 31P{1H} NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS analyses combined with DFT calculations. The C&#8722;P coupling has been generalized to other C^N cyclometalated AuIII complexes and other tertiary phosphines. Overall, this work provides new insights into the reactivity of cyclometalated AuIII compounds and establishes initial structure&#8211;activity relationships to develop AuIII&#8208;mediated C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions.
