      <title>Semi&#8208;Rationally Designed Short Peptides Self&#8208;Assemble and Bind Hemin to Promote Cyclopropanation</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanoassemblies capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have semi&#8208;rationally designed a series of seven&#8208;residue peptides that form hemin&#8208;binding catalytic amyloids to facilitate enantioselective cyclopropanation with efficiencies that rival those of engineered hemin proteins. These results demonstrate that: 1. Catalytic amyloids can bind complex metallocofactors to promote practically important multisubstrate transformations; 2. Even essentially flat surfaces of amyloid assemblies can impart a substantial degree of enantioselectivity without the need for extensive optimization; 3. The ease of peptide preparation allows for straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids and preparation of peptides made of D&#8208;amino acids with complete reversal of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>On&#8208;surface assembly of hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular graphyne&#8208;like networks</title>
      <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface assembly of graphyne&#8208;related two&#8208; dimensional (2D) materials is directive for the long&#8208;awaited reliable synthesis of the carbon allotrope graphyne. Some of the challenges in the graphyne synthesis is the control of the alkyne coupling reaction on metal surfaces and the fabrication of single&#8208;layered materials in solution&#8208;based methods. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular approach to fabricate highly ordered monolayered hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonded graphyne&#8208;like 2D materials from triethynyltriazine derivatives on Au(111) and Ag(111). The 2D networks are stabilized by N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8722;C(  sp  )&#8208;bonds and N&#183;&#183;&#183;Br&#8722;C(  sp  )&#8208;bonds to the triazine core, respectively. The structural properties and the binding energies of the supramolecular graphynes have been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density&#8208;functional theory calculations. It is revealed that the  N&#183;&#183;&#183;Br&#8722;C(  sp  )  &#8208;bonds lead to significantly stronger bonded networks compared to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. A systematic analysis of the binding energies of triethynyltriazine and triethynylbenzene derivatives further demonstrates that the X  3  &#8208;synthon, which is commonly observed for bromobenzene derivatives, is weaker than the X  6  &#8208;synthon for our bromotriethynyl derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of the Cyclic Depsipeptide Vioprolide D via its (Z)&#8208;Diastereoisomer</title>
      <dc:description>The first total synthesis of vioprolide D was accomplished in an overall yield of 2.0% starting from methyl (2S)&#8208;3&#8208;benzyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#173;propanoate (16 steps in the longest linear sequence). The cyclic depsipeptide was assembled from two building blocks of similar size and complexity in a modular, highly convergent approach. Peptide bond formation at the C&#8208;terminal dehydrobutyrine amino acid of the Northern fragment was possible via its (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer. After macrolactamization and formation of the thiazoline ring, the (Z)&#8208;double bond of the dehydrobutyrine unit was isomerized to the (E)&#8208;double bond of the natural product. The cytotoxicity of vioprolide D is significantly higher than that of its (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer.</dc:description>

      <title>Modelling Photosynthesis with Zn(II)&#8208;Protoporphyrin all&#8208;DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex/Aptamer Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;DNA scaffolds act as templates for the organization of photosystem I (PS I) model systems. A series of DNA templates composed of Zn(II)&#8208;protoporphyrin IX (Zn(II)PPIX)&#8208;functionalized G&#8208;quadruplex conjugated to the 3  '  &#8208; or 5  '  &#8208;end of the tyrosinamide (TA) aptamer and Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to the 3  '  &#8208; and 5  '  &#8208;ends of the tyrosinamide aptamer through a four&#8208;thymidine (4&#215;T) bridge, structures I to IV. Effective photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex to bipyridinium functionalized tyrosinamide, TA&#8208;MV  2+  , bound to the TA aptamer units is demonstrated. The order of photosensitized ET quenching in the photosystems is III &gt; IV &gt; I &gt; II and follows the binding affinities of TA&#8208;MV  2+  to the aptamer units. The effectiveness of the primary ET quenching of Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex by TA&#8208;MV  2+  controls the efficiency of the generation of TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  , under steady&#8208;state illumination, in the presence of 2&#8208;mercaptoethanol as sacrificial electron donor. The photosystem&#8208;controlled formation of TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  by the different photosystems dictates the secondary activation of the ET cascade corresponding to the ferredoxin&#8208;NADP  +  reductase, FNR, catalysed reduction of NADP  +  to NADPH by TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  , and the sequestered alcohol dehydrogenase catalysed reduction of acetophenone to 1&#8208;phenylethanol by NADPH. The photosensitizer&#8208;aptamer conjugates reveal switchable &#8220;ON&#8221;/&#8220;OFF&#8221; photoactivities. Also, a photosystem consisting of Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to the 3  '  &#8208; and 5  '  &#8208;ends of two TA aptamer units, structure V, revealing the improved photoinduced ET quenching and subsequent biocatalytic cascades, is presented. Scaling of the all&#8208;DNA photosensitizer&#8208;aptamer/electron acceptor is achieved by the rolling&#8208;circle&#8208;amplified (RCA) synthesis of micrometre&#8208;long chains consisting of Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to two TA aptamer repeat units.</dc:description>

The photosystem&#8208;controlled formation of TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  by the different photosystems dictates the secondary activation of the ET cascade corresponding to the ferredoxin&#8208;NADP  +  reductase, FNR, catalysed reduction of NADP  +  to NADPH by TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  , and the sequestered alcohol dehydrogenase catalysed reduction of acetophenone to 1&#8208;phenylethanol by NADPH. The photosensitizer&#8208;aptamer conjugates reveal switchable &#8220;ON&#8221;/&#8220;OFF&#8221; photoactivities. Also, a photosystem consisting of Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to the 3  '  &#8208; and 5  '  &#8208;ends of two TA aptamer units, structure V, revealing the improved photoinduced ET quenching and subsequent biocatalytic cascades, is presented. Scaling of the all&#8208;DNA photosensitizer&#8208;aptamer/electron acceptor is achieved by the rolling&#8208;circle&#8208;amplified (RCA) synthesis of micrometre&#8208;long chains consisting of Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to two TA aptamer repeat units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Solvent Molecule Cooperation Enhancing Lithium Metal Battery Performance at Both Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A good mix: In an ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;ethylene sulfite (ES) mixed electrolyte, EC dominates the solvation sheath of Li+ and mitigates side reactions on both electrodes and ES introduces sulfur&#8208;containing species at the solid electrolyte interphase on the Li metal anode. Taken together the components of the electrolyte solvent enable efficient and stable cycling of Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing electrolytes compatible with efficient and reversible cycling of electrodes is critical to the success of rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs). The Coulombic efficiencies and cycle lives of LMBs with ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate, ethylene sulfite (ES), and their combinations as electrolyte solvents show that in a binary&#8208;solvent electrolyte the extent of electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface is dependent on the solvent component that dominates the solvation sheath of Li+. This knowledge led to the development of an EC&#8208;ES electrolyte exhibiting high performance for Li||LiFePO4 batteries. Carbonate molecules occupy the solvation sheath and improve the Coulombic efficiencies of both the anode and cathode. Sulfite molecules lead to desirable morphology and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase and extend the cycle life of the Li metal anode. The cooperation between these components provides a new example of electrolyte optimization for improved LMBs.

      <title>In situ Synthesis of Biomimetic Silica Nanofibrous Aerogels with Temperature&#8208;Invariant Superelasticity over One Million Compressions</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic aerogels are fabricated by combining flexible electrospun silica nanofibers and rubber&#8208;like Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si networks via an in situ synthesis strategy. The aerogels exhibit temperature&#8208;invariant superelasticity, fire resistance, and ultralow thermal conductivity, which make them promising thermal insulation materials for extreme environments.







Abstract
Resilient and compressible three&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials comprising polymers, carbon, and metals have been prepared in diverse forms. However, the creation of thermostable elastic ceramic aerogels remains an enormous challenge. We demonstrate an in&#8197;situ synthesis strategy to develop biomimetic silica nanofibrous (SNF) aerogels with superelasticity by integrating flexible electrospun silica nanofibers and rubber&#8208;like Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonding networks. The stable bonding structure among nanofibers is in&#8197;situ constructed along with a fibrous freeze&#8208;shaping process. The resultant SNF aerogels exhibit integrated properties of ultralow density (&gt;0.25&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3), temperature&#8208;invariant superelasticity up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, and robust fatigue resistance over one million compressions. The ceramic nature also endows the aerogels with fire resistance and ultralow thermal conductivity. The successful synthesis of the SNF aerogels opens new pathways for the design of superelastic ceramic aerogels in a structurally adaptive and scalable form.

Abstract
Voltage decay and capacity fading are the main challenges for the commercialization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs). Now, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment is designed via the pyrolysis of urea to improve the voltage and capacity stability of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 (LMNO), by which oxygen vacancies, spinel phase integration, and N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayers are synchronously built on the surface of LMNO microspheres. Oxygen vacancies and spinel phase integration suppress irreversible O2 release and help lithium ion diffusion, while N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayer mitigates the corrosion of electrolyte with excellent conductivity. The electrochemical performance of LMNO after the treatment improves significantly; the capacity retention rate after 500 cycles at 1&#8201;C is still as high as 89.9&#8201;% with a very small voltage fading rate of 1.09&#8197;mV&#8201;cycle&#8722;1. This three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment strategy can suppress the voltage decay and capacity fading of LLOs.

Abstract
Tetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene (LH4) can be used as a coordination platform to bind four CuI ions at the thiolate and thioether S atoms. Donor ligands such as phosphanes can stabilize the resulting [LCu4] units, which then remain monomeric ([(Ph3PCu)4L]). In the absence of donor ligands, they aggregate, providing a hexamer ([LCu4]6) in high yields, with a hollow&#8208;sphere structure formed by an unprecedented Cu24S48 cage that is surrounded by the organic framework of the calixarene chalices. Preliminary NMR experiments with regard to the host&#8208;guest chemistry in solution showed that the compound represents a polytopic host for acetonitrile and methane.

In the frame: Presented here is the first organocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of novel axially chiral N&#8208;arylcarbazole frameworks by the assembly of azonaphthalenes and carbazoles.

Abstract
N&#8208;arylcarbazole structures are important because of their prevalence in natural products and functional OLED materials. C&#8722;H amination of arenes has been widely recognized as the most efficient approach to access these structures. Conventional strategies involving transition&#8208;metal catalysts suffer from confined substrate generality and the requirement of exogenous oxidants. Organocatalytic enantioselective C&#8211;N chiral axis construction remains elusive.

      <title>Formation and Characterization of a BeOBeC Multiple Radical Featuring a Quartet Carbyne Moiety</title>
      <dc:description>
The BeOBeC multiple radical features a quartet carbyne moiety, and thus represents the first carbyne radical to have a quartet ground state with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center.







Abstract
Through reaction of beryllium dimers with carbon monoxide, a carbonyl complex BeBeCO is formed in solid neon. Upon visible light excitation, the BeBeCO complex rearranges to a BeCOBe isomer, which further isomerizes to a low&#8208;energy BeOBeC species under UV&#8208;visible light excitation. These species are identified on the basis of infrared absorption spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical studies. The BeOBeC molecule is characterized to be a multiple radical species having an electronic quintet ground state featuring an unusual quartet carbyne unit with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center. Bonding analysis indicates that the strong Pauli repulsion between carbon 2s lone pair electrons and the &#963; electrons of the BeOBe fragment significantly weakens the Be&#8722;C bonding and destabilizes the triplet state of the BeOBeC radical with a doublet carbyne unit. The three&#8208;center &#960;&#8208;bonding of BeOBe is also found to play a role in stabilizing the quartet carbyne.

      <title>How Nano&#8208;Ions Act Like Ionic Surfactants</title>
      <dc:description>
Free of charge: Inorganic nano&#8208;ions were found to act like (organic) ionic surfactants when added to dilute solutions of non&#8208;ionic surfactants, inducing spontaneous vesicle formation by adsorption and thus electrically charging the non&#8208;ionic lamellar phase. Although they are fundamentally different, nano&#8208;ions can serve as alternatives to ionic surfactants.







Abstract
Recently, nanometric ions were shown to adsorb to hydrated neutral surfaces and to bind to the cavities of macrocyclic molecules with an unexpectedly strong affinity arising from a solvent&#8208;mediated effect named superchaotropicity. We show here that nano&#8208;ions at low concentrations (&#956;m range), similarly to anionic surfactants, induce the spontaneous transformation of a swollen lyotropic lamellar phase of non&#8208;ionic surfactant into a vesicle phase. This transition occurs when the neutral lamellae acquire charges, either by adsorption of the nano&#8208;ions onto, or by anchoring of the ionic surfactant into the lamellae. In contrast to ionic surfactants, nano&#8208;ions strongly dehydrate the neutral surfactant assemblies. As a conclusion, these purely inorganic nanometric ions act as alternatives to the widely used organic ionic surfactants.

      <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson&#8208;Phase Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics with Improved Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimensional DJ: A Dion&#8211;Jacobson&#8208;phase lead&#8208;free perovskite, (BEA)FAn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 (BEA=1,4&#8208;butanediamine, FA=formamidinium), is used to fabricated perovskite solar cells. The representative (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 perovskite exhibits excellent optical absorption and carrier transport, resulting in a record power conversion efficiency of 6.43&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;butanediamine (BEA) is incorporated into FASnI3 (FA=formamidinium) to develop a series of lead&#8208;free low&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson&#8208;phase perovskites, (BEA)FAn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1. The broadness of the (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 band gap appears to be influenced by the structural distortion owing to high symmetry. The introduction of BEA ligand stabilizes the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure (formation energy ca. 106&#8197;j&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. The compact (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 dominated film enables a weakened carrier localization mechanism with a charge transfer time of only 0.36&#8197;ps among the quantum wells, resulting in a carrier diffusion length over 450&#8197;nm for electrons and 340&#8197;nm for holes, respectively. Solar cell fabrication with (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.43&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. The devices can retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 1000&#8197;h without encapsulation under N2 environment.

      <title>Characterization of [2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Bridged Protein Complexes and Reaction Intermediates by use of Native Mass Spectrometric Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
[2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged complexes are characterized by use of online buffer exchange coupled to native mass spectrometry (OBE nMS). Cluster&#8208;transfer reactions between holo complexes and apo ferredoxin (FDX2) are monitored by use of OBE nMS, and intermediate Fe&#8211;S species are detected.







Abstract
Many iron&#8211;sulfur proteins involved in cluster trafficking form [2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged complexes that are often challenging to characterize because of the inherent instability of the cluster at the interface. Herein, we illustrate the use of fast, online buffer exchange coupled to a native mass spectrometry (OBE nMS) method to characterize [2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged proteins and their transient cluster&#8208;transfer intermediates. The use of this mechanistic and protein&#8208;characterization tool is demonstrated with holo glutaredoxin&#8197;5 (GLRX5) homodimer and holo GLRX5:BolA&#8208;like protein&#8197;3 (BOLA3) heterodimer. Using the OBE nMS method, cluster&#8208;transfer reactions between the holo&#8208;dimers and apo&#8208;ferredoxin (FDX2) are monitored, and intermediate [2Fe&#8211;2S] species, such as (FDX2:GLRX5:[2Fe&#8211;2S]:GSH) and (FDX2:BOLA3:GLRX5:[2Fe&#8211;2S]:GSH) are detected. The OBE nMS method is a robust technique for characterizing iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged protein complexes and transient iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster transfer intermediates.

      <title>Fabrication of Heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 Nanocages with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages are fabricated through a facile synthetic approach. With the advantages of the novel hollow heterostructure, the well&#8208;defined FeTi2O5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages exhibit enhanced photoelectrochemical performance compared with TiO2 nanodisks, Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles, and Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Photocatalysts with well&#8208;designed compositions and structures are desirable for achieving highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Heterostructured semiconductor photocatalysts with advanced hollow structures possess beneficial features for promoting the activity towards photocatalytic reactions. Here we develop a facile synthetic strategy for the fabrication of Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages (NCs) as anode materials in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells. A hydrothermal reaction is performed to transform MIL&#8208;125(Ti) nanodisks (NDs) to Ti&#8211;Fe&#8211;O NCs, which are further converted to Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NCs through a post annealing process. Owing to the compositional and structural advantages, the heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NCs show enhanced performance for PEC water oxidation compared with TiO2 NDs, Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles (NPs) and Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NPs.

      <title>Thermal and Nonthermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrochemistry at Nanostructured Ag Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy bypassing inaccuracies in local temperature measurement was invented for quantitatively disentangling hot electron effect and thermal effect in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrochemical reactions, unveiling the dominant and potential&#8208;dependent role of thermal effect at nanostructured Ag electrodes.







Abstract
Hot carriers (HCs) and thermal effects, stemming from plasmon decays, are crucial for most plasmonic applications. However, quantifying these two effects remains extremely challenging due to the experimental difficulty in accurately measuring the temperature at reaction sites. Herein, we provide a novel strategy to disentangle HCs from photothermal effects based on the different traits of heat dissipation (long range) and HCs transport (short range), and quantitatively uncover the dominant and potential&#8208;dependent role of photothermal effect by investigating the rapid&#8208; and slow&#8208;response currents in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrochemistry at nanostructured Ag electrode. Furthermore, the plasmoelectric surface potential is found to contribute to the rapid&#8208;response currents, which is absent in the previous studies.

      <title>Raman Optical Activity (ROA) as a New Tool to Elucidate the Helical Structure of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
      <dc:description>Poly(phenylacetylene)s is a family of helical polymers constituted by conjugated double bonds that are fixed into specific helical structures due to supramolecular and/or steric interactions among pendant groups.

      <title>Heterologous Expression and Engineering of the Nitrogenase Cofactor Biosynthesis Scaffold NifEN</title>
      <dc:description>
NifEN resembles the catalytic component of nitrogenase, NifDK, in structure and function. The expression and engineering of a NifEN variant, which mimics NifDK in retaining the cofactor at an analogous binding site, in E.&#8197;coli is reported. This observation demonstrates the feasibility of generating a functional NifDK equivalent on a NifEN template, which could facilitate future heterologous expression and mechanistic investigation of nitrogenase.







Abstract
NifEN plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of nitrogenase, catalyzing the final step of cofactor maturation prior to delivering the cofactor to NifDK, the catalytic component of nitrogenase. The difficulty in expressing NifEN, a complex, heteromultimeric metalloprotein sharing structural/functional homology with NifDK, is a major challenge in the heterologous expression of nitrogenase. Herein, we report the expression and engineering of Azotobacter vinelandii NifEN in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and spectroscopic analyses demonstrate the integrity of the heterologously expressed NifEN in composition and functionality and, additionally, the ability of an engineered NifEN variant to mimic NifDK in retaining the matured cofactor at an analogous cofactor&#8208;binding site. This is an important step toward piecing together a viable pathway for the heterologous expression of nitrogenase and identifying variants for the mechanistic investigation of this enzyme.

Near&#8208;infrared picosecond laser pulses activated the gold&#8208;coating on the surface of nanovesicles, creating nanomechanical stress and leading to near&#8208;complete vesicle cargo release in sub&#8208;seconds. Compared to natural phospholipid liposomes, the photo&#8208;release was possible at 40 times lower laser energy. This high photosensitivity enables photorelease of molecules down to a depth of 4 mm in mouse brain.

      <dc:description>Discriminative detection of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers is crucial for their effective treatment and prognosis. However, activatable probes able to do so  in vivo  have been rarely developed. We herein report an activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) that specifically turns on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and photoacoustic (PA) signals in response to the urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) overexpressed by invasive breast cancer. P&#8208;Dex has a renal&#8208;clearable dextran backbone which is linked with a NIR dye caged with an uPA&#8208;cleavable peptide substrate. Such a molecular design allows P&#8208;Dex to passive target tumors, activate NIR fluorescence and PA signals to effectively distinguish invasive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer from noninvasive MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to minimize the toxicity potential.

But little information exists on how the inter&#8208;organelle crosstalk impacts cancer cells due to the lack of approaches that manipulate inter&#8208;organelle communication in cancer cells.

A protease on the mitochondria cleaves the Flag from the complex of MitoFlag and H2B to form assemblies that retain H2B on the mitochondria and facilitate the H2B entering mitochondria. Molecular validation of MitoFlag shows that adding NLS, replacing aspartic acid residues by glutamic acid residues, or changing L&#8208;aspartic acid to D&#8208;aspartic residue abolishes the trafficking of H2B into mitochondria of HeLa cells.

      <title>Synthesis of Polybenzoacenes by Annulative Dimerization of Phenylene Triflate through Twofold C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Fused polyaromatics represent an emerging class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the area of optoelectronic devices and materials. We have established unprecedented synthetic routes to various fused polyaromatics from simple phenol derivatives by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulative dimerization of phenylene triflate through twofold C&#8208;H activation. The initially formed partially fused polyaromatics can be smoothly transformed into a variety of fully fused polyaromatics by the Scholl reaction.

      <title>Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Ketones Mediated by Nickel(I) Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Squeezing in CO: NiI complexes can promote the carbonylative coupling of NiII&#8208;acyl complexes with primary and secondary iodides to provide a general method for the accessing aliphatic ketones directly from carbon monoxide. The methodology is ideal for carbon isotope labeling and illustrated with examples for accessing carbon&#8197;13 and carbon&#8197;14 bioactive molecules.







Abstract
An extensive range of functionalized aliphatic ketones with good functional&#8208;group tolerance has been prepared by a NiI&#8208;promoted coupling of either primary or secondary alkyl iodides with NN2 pincer NiII&#8208;acyl complexes. The latter were easily accessed from the corresponding NiII&#8208;alkyl complexes with stoichiometric CO. This Ni&#8208;mediated carbonylative coupling is adaptable to late&#8208;stage carbon isotope labeling, as illustrated by the preparation of isotopically labelled pharmaceuticals. Preliminary investigations suggest the intermediacy of carbon&#8208;centered radicals.

      <title>Three&#8208;Pronged Attack by Homologous Far&#8208;Red/NIR AIEgens to Achieve "1+1+1&gt;3" Synergistic Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has long been proven to be a powerful therapeutic modality for cancer. However, PDT strategy is undiversified and stereotyped in recent years. Exploration of distinctive PDT protocol is highly in demand but remains a severe challenge. Herein, an unprecedented &#8220;1+1+1&gt;3&#8221; synergistic strategy is proposed and validated for the first time. Three homologous luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics are rationally designed based on a simple backbone. By slight structural tuning, these far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared AIE luminogens are capable of specifically anchoring to mitochondria, cellular membrane and lysosome, and effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, biological studies demonstrate that by combined usage of three AIE photosensitizers, multiple ROS sources synchronously derived from several organelles exhibit superior therapeutic effect than that of single organelle under the same photosensitizers&#8217; concentration. This strategy is conceptually and operationally simple, providing an innovative approach and renewed awareness of improving therapeutic effect through three&#8208;pronged PDT.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Cellular senescence is stress&#8208;induced irreversible growth arrest, and is thought to impair tissue function. The clearance of senescent cells can delay the features of senescence. Here, we report the development of plasmonic core&#8211;shell spiky nanorods (CSNRs) surface&#8208;modified with an anti&#8208; beta&#8208;2&#8208;microglobulin (aB2MG) antibody and triphenylphosphonium (TPP), to target the mitochondria in senescent cells. The results demonstrated that Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiated aB2MG&#8211;TPP@CSNRs selectively caused mitochondrial damage and cell&#8208;intrinsic apoptosis of senescent cells with relatively low NIR light power, and the ability of CSNRs to activate and amplify the immune response  in vitro  and  in vivo  was discovered. The mechanism was revealed that photo&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation resulted in the senescent cell apoptosis and meanwhile immune adjuvant effect by CSNRs accelerated the clearance of senescent cells in mice. This study opens the way for the use of precisely regulated plasma nanostructures for immune adjuvant and photo&#8208;induced apoptosis for age&#8208;related senescence.</dc:description>

      <title>Bridged Stilbenes: AIEgens Designed via a Simple Strategy to Control the Non&#8208;radiative Decay Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>To broaden the application of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens), the design of novel small&#8208;molecular dyes that exhibit high fluorescence quantum yield ( &#934;  fl  ) in the solid state is required. Considering that the mechanism of AIE can be rationalized based on steric avoidance of non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, a series of bridged stilbenes was designed, and their non&#8208;radiative decay pathways were investigated theoretically. Bridged stilbenes with short alkyl chains exhibited a strong fluorescence emission in solution and in the solid state, while bridged stilbenes with long alkyl chains exhibited AIE. Based on this theoretical prediction, we developed the bridged stilbenes BPST[7]  and DPB[7]  , which demonstrate excellent AIE behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>Migratory Hydrogenation of Terminal Alkynes by Base/Cobalt Relay Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A relay: A base and cobalt relay catalytic process for the selective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes and conjugated E&#8197;alkenes by migratory hydrogenation of terminal alkynes was developed. And the corresponding terminal alkenes can also be readily obtained by slightly tuning the reaction conditions, thus allowing a divergent synthesis of 1&#8208;alkenes and either Z&#8208; or E&#8208;internal alkenes by hydrogenation of terminal alkynes with effective control of the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Migratory functionalization of alkenes has emerged as a powerful strategy to achieve functionalization at a distal position to the original reactive site on a hydrocarbon chain. However, an analogous protocol for alkyne substrates is yet to be developed. Herein, a base and cobalt relay catalytic process for the selective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes and conjugated E&#8197;alkenes by migratory hydrogenation of terminal alkynes is disclosed. Mechanistic studies support a relay catalytic process involving a sequential base&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of terminal alkynes and cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of either 2&#8208;alkynes or conjugated diene intermediates. Notably, this practical non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system enables efficient control of the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity of this transformation.

      <title>Disentangling Reaction Processes of Zeolites within Single&#8208;Oriented Channels</title>
      <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined model system was developed to establish structure&#8211;reactivity relationships for specific zeolite&#8208;channel orientations during catalytic reactions, such as the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. Straight zeolite&#8208;channels favor the formation of internal coke, promoting the aromatic cycle, and sinusoidal zeolite&#8208;channels produce aromatics that eventually grow into condensed polyaromatics at the surface leading to deactivation of the zeolites.







Abstract
Establishing structure&#8211;reactivity relationships for specific channel orientations of zeolites is vital to developing new, superior materials for various applications, including oil and gas conversion processes. Herein, a well&#8208;defined model system was developed to build structure&#8211;reactivity relationships for specific zeolite&#8208;channel orientations during various catalytic reaction processes, for example, the methanol&#8208; and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH and ETH) process as well as oligomerization reactions. The entrapped and effluent hydrocarbons from single&#8208;oriented zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 channels during the MTH process were monitored by using operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and on&#8208;line mass spectrometry (MS), respectively. The results reveal that the straight channels favor the formation of internal coke, promoting the aromatic cycle. Furthermore, the sinusoidal channels produce aromatics, (e.g., toluene) that further grow into larger polyaromatics (e.g., graphitic coke) leading to deactivation of the zeolites. This underscores the importance of careful engineering of materials to suppress coke formation and tune product distribution by rational control of the location of zeolite acid sites and crystallographic orientations.

      <dc:description>
Trapped: A nondirected keteniminium&#8208;driven multicomponent 1,2&#8208;umpolung difunctionalization of ynamides with aryl diazonium salts and aryl boronic acids under Pd catalysis for the synthesis of triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is showcased for the first time. This transformation proceeds by 1,3&#8208;migration of an electrophile from in situ generated keteniminium species to the electrophilic &#945;&#8208;position of the ynamide, followed by trapping of nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;vinylic metal species with a nucleophile.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of ynamides, aryl diazonium salts, and aryl boronic acids for the synthesis of novel triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is described. This transformation represents the first example of an umpolung regioselective unsymmetrical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation/aryl&#8208;olefination of ynamides. The aryl moieties of the diazonium salt (electrophile) and boronic acid (nucleophile) are explicitly incorporated in the electrophilic &#945;&#8208; and nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;position, respectively, of the ynamide, resulting in a single isomer of the N&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted olefin. The scope is broad (68 examples), showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. DFT calculations substantiate the rationale of the mechanistic cycle and the regioselectivity. The chemoselectivity and synthetic potential of the enamide products were also studied.

      <dc:description>
Designer proteins: The de&#8197;novo design of metalloproteins allows the determination of what is required to build in function in an unrelated protein structure. This Review focuses on protein design efforts to create de&#8197;novo metalloproteins within alpha&#8208;helical scaffolds; it showcases the versatility of alpha helices as scaffolds for metalloprotein design as well as the progress that is possible through rational design.







Abstract
The relationship between protein structure and function is one of the greatest puzzles within biochemistry. De&#8197;novo metalloprotein design is a way to wipe the board clean and determine what is required to build in function from the ground up in an unrelated structure. This Review focuses on protein design efforts to create de&#8197;novo metalloproteins within alpha&#8208;helical scaffolds. Examples of successful designs include those with carbonic anhydrase or nitrite reductase activity by incorporating a ZnHis3 or CuHis3 site, or that recapitulate the spectroscopic properties of unique electron&#8208;transfer sites in cupredoxins (CuHis2Cys) or rubredoxins (FeCys4). This work showcases the versatility of alpha helices as scaffolds for metalloprotein design and the progress that is possible through careful rational design. Our studies cover the invariance of carbonic anhydrase activity with different site positions and scaffolds, refinement of our cupredoxin models, and enhancement of nitrite reductase activity up to 1000&#8208;fold.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Structure&#8208;Directed Metal&#8211;Organic Zeolite&#8208;like Networks as Biomacromolecule Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>
Caught in a trap: Proteins are used to direct the formation of new zeolitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that encapsulate the template proteins under ambient conditions. Histidines in the proteins play a crucial role in directing the formation of these MOFs. The MOF&#8208;encapsulated proteins retain their activity even after exposure to high temperature and organic solvents.







Abstract
Fabrication of zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) for advanced applications, such as enzyme immobilization, is of great interest but is a great synthetic challenge. Herein, we have developed a new strategy using proteins as structure&#8208;directed agents to direct the formation of new ZMOFs that can act as versatile platforms for the in&#8197;situ encapsulation of proteins under ambient conditions. Notably, protein incorporation directs the formation of a ZMOF with a sodalite (sod) topology instead of a non&#8208;porous diamondoid (dia) topology under analogous synthetic conditions. Histidines in proteins play a crucial role in the observed templating effect. Modulating histidine content thereby influenced the resultant MOF product (from dia to dia + sod mixture and, ultimately, to sod MOF). Moreover, the resulting ZMOF&#8208;incorporated proteins preserved their activity even after exposure to high temperatures and organic solvents, demonstrating their potential for biocatalysis and biopharmaceutical applications.

Herein, we have developed a new strategy using proteins as structure&#8208;directed agents to direct the formation of new ZMOFs that can act as versatile platforms for the in&#8197;situ encapsulation of proteins under ambient conditions. Notably, protein incorporation directs the formation of a ZMOF with a sodalite (&lt;b&gt;sod&lt;/b&gt;) topology instead of a non&#8208;porous diamondoid (&lt;b&gt;dia&lt;/b&gt;) topology under analogous synthetic conditions. Histidines in proteins play a crucial role in the observed templating effect. Modulating histidine content thereby influenced the resultant MOF product (from &lt;b&gt;dia&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;dia&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;sod&lt;/b&gt; mixture and, ultimately, to &lt;b&gt;sod&lt;/b&gt; MOF). Moreover, the resulting ZMOF&#8208;incorporated proteins preserved their activity even after exposure to high temperatures and organic solvents, demonstrating their potential for biocatalysis and biopharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyridinium&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethylenes as new autophagy modulators for cancer therapy and the alkyl chain length effect</title>
      <dc:description>Controllable tuning autophagy is an attractive target for cancer therapy, however, it remains difficult and challenging. We report herein pyridinium&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethylene salts PTPE  1  &#8208;  3  which can target mitochondria and induce autophagy after forming complexes with albumin. It is interesting to note that mitochondrion affinity and autophagy&#8208;inducing level can be improved by prolonging the lengths of alkyl chains in PTPE  1  &#8208;  3  . In particular, PTPE  1  &#8208;  3  not only show pro&#8208;autophagic activity, but also exhibit mitophagy blockage effect. Failure in autophagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion in downstream autophagy flux results in cancer cell death. Besides, fast formation of complexes of PTPE  1  &#8208;  3  with albumin in blood can facilitate biomimetic delivery and deep tumor penetration. Efficient tumor accumulation and effective tumor suppression are successfully demonstrated with both  in vitro  and  in vivo  studies. Therefore, PTPE  1  &#8208;  3  salts exhibit dual functions: i) they can target and image mitochondria because of AIE effect, and ii) they are promising for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible and Selective CO2 to HCO2&#8722; Electrocatalysis near the Thermodynamic Potential</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversible CO2 to HCO2&#8722; conversion is catalyzed by using Pt(depe)2][PF6]2 as an electrocatalyst (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane). High&#8208; and low&#8208;energy intermediates are avoided by considering the thermodynamic driving force for each step.







Abstract
Reversible catalysis is a hallmark of energy&#8208;efficient chemical transformations, but can only be achieved if the changes in free energy of intermediate steps are minimized and the catalytic cycle is devoid of high transition&#8208;state barriers. Using these criteria, we demonstrate reversible CO2/HCO2&#8722; conversion catalyzed by [Pt(depe)2]2+ (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane). Direct measurement of the free energies associated with each catalytic step correctly predicts a slight bias towards CO2 reduction. We demonstrate how the experimentally measured free energy of each step directly contributes to the &lt;50&#8197;mV overpotential. We also find that for CO2 reduction, H2 evolution is negligible and the Faradaic efficiency for HCO2&#8722; production is nearly quantitative. A free&#8208;energy analysis reveals H2 evolution is endergonic, providing a thermodynamic basis for highly selective CO2 reduction.

      <title>Fluorophore&#8208;Promoted RNA Folding and Photostability Enables Imaging of Single Broccoli&#8208;Tagged mRNAs in Live Mammalian Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Spinach and Broccoli are fluorogenic RNA aptamers that bind DFHBI, a mimic of the GFP chromophore, and activate its fluorescence. Computational screening led to the development of BI, a DFHBI derivative that binds Broccoli with higher affinity. BI promotes Broccoli folding and the resulting Broccoli&#8208;BI complexes exhibit markedly higher fluorescence and photostability. These improvements enable imaging of Broccoli&#8208;tagged single mRNA transcripts in live mammalian cells for the first time.







Abstract
Spinach and Broccoli are fluorogenic RNA aptamers that bind DFHBI, a mimic of the chromophore in green fluorescent protein, and activate its fluorescence. Spinach/Broccoli&#8208;DFHBI complexes exhibit high fluorescence in vitro, but they exhibit lower fluorescence in mammalian cells. Here, computational screening was used to identify BI, a DFHBI derivative that binds Broccoli with higher affinity and leads to markedly higher fluorescence in cells compared to previous ligands. BI prevents thermal unfolding of Broccoli at 37&#8201;&#176;C, leading to more folded Broccoli and thus more fluorescent Broccoli&#8208;BI complexes in cells. Broccoli&#8208;BI complexes are more photostable owing to impaired photoisomerization and rapid unbinding of photoisomerized cis&#8208;BI. These properties enable single mRNA containing 24 Broccoli aptamers to be imaged in live mammalian cells treated with BI. Small molecule ligands can thus promote RNA folding in cells, and thus allow single mRNA imaging with fluorogenic aptamers.

      <title>Dinuclear Metal&#8208;ProPhenol Catalysts: Development and Synthetic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Dinuclear metal&#8208;ProPhenol complexes are versatile catalysts that have been used to facilitate a broad range of asymmetric transformations, including aldol, Mannich, Henry reactions, alkynylation and conjugation additions. Moreover, many of the reported processes have been directly employed in the syntheses of natural products and other biologically active molecules.







Abstract
The ProPhenol ligand is a member of the chiral aza&#8208;crown family that spontaneously forms a bimetallic complex upon treatment with alkyl metal reagents, such as Et2Zn and Bu2Mg. The resulting complex features Lewis acidic and Br&#248;nsted basic sites, enabling simultaneous activation of both nucleophile and electrophile in the same chiral environment. Since the initial report in 2000, metal&#8208;ProPhenol catalysts have been used to facilitate a broad range of asymmetric transformations, including aldol, Mannich, and Henry reactions, as well as alkynylations and conjugation additions. By promoting such a diverse array of reactions, these complexes provide rapid and atom&#8208;economical access to valuable complex building blocks. In this Review, we describe in detail the development and synthetic applications of these versatile catalysts with a special focus on recent efforts to improve reactivity and selectivity through ligand design and structural modification.

      <title>Versatile Fluorescent Probes for Imaging the Superoxide Anion in Living Cells and In&#8197;Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
Super probes for superoxide: Recent developments in the imaging of the superoxide anion in living cells and in&#8197;vivo with versatile fluorescent probes are discussed in depth in this Minireview. An emphasis is placed on the design strategies for these probes, thereby providing guidelines for the potential study of the superoxide anion.







Abstract
The superoxide anion (O2.&#8722;) is widely engaged in the regulation of cell functions and is thereby intimately associated with the onset and progression of many diseases. To ascertain the pathological roles of O2.&#8722; in related diseases, developing effective methods for monitoring O2.&#8722; in biological systems is essential. Fluorescence imaging is a powerful tool for monitoring bioactive molecules in cells and in&#8197;vivo owing to its high sensitivity and high temporal&#8208;spatial resolution. Therefore, increasing numbers of fluorescent imaging probes have been constructed to monitor O2.&#8722; inside live cells and small animals. In this minireview, we summarize the methods for design and application of O2.&#8722;&#8208;responsive fluorescent probes. Moreover, we present the challenges for detecting O2.&#8722; and suggestions for constructing new fluorescent probes that can indicate the production sites and concentration changes in O2.&#8722; as well as O2.&#8722;&#8208;associated active molecules in living cells and in&#8197;vivo.

      <title>Alkyl&#8208;Chain&#8208;Regulated Charge Transfer in Fluorescent Inorganic CsPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Chain gang: Regulating the alkyl&#8208;chain length of quantum dots attached to inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites maximizes charge extraction and transfer at the perovskite/carbon interface. The optimized inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell (PSC) with C12 alkyl chain QDs yields an efficiency of up to 10.85&#8201;%.







Abstract
Improved charge extraction and wide spectral absorption promote power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;based CsPbBr3 PSCs have an inferior power output capacity because of the large optical band gap of the perovskite film and the high energy barrier at perovskite/carbon interface. Herein, we use alkyl&#8208;chain regulated quantum dots as hole&#8208;conductors to reduce charge recombination.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chain gang&lt;/b&gt;: Regulating the alkyl&#8208;chain length of quantum dots attached to inorganic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites maximizes charge extraction and transfer at the perovskite/carbon interface. The optimized inorganic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cell (PSC) with C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; alkyl chain QDs yields an efficiency of up to 10.85&#8201;%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved charge extraction and wide spectral absorption promote power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;based CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs have an inferior power output capacity because of the large optical band gap of the perovskite film and the high energy barrier at perovskite/carbon interface. Herein, we use alkyl&#8208;chain regulated quantum dots as hole&#8208;conductors to reduce charge recombination. By precisely controlling alkyl&#8208;chain length of ligands, a balance between the surface dipole induced charge coulomb repulsive force and quantum tunneling distance is achieved to maximize charge extraction. A fluorescent carbon electrode is used as a cathode to harvest the unabsorbed incident light and to emit fluorescent light at 516&#8197;nm for re&#8208;absorption by the perovskite film. The optimized PSC free of encapsulation achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency up to 10.85&#8201;% with nearly unchanged photovoltaic performances under 80&#8201;%RH, 80&#8201;&#176;C, or light irradiation in air.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Compaction of High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Mg3Sb2 Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;step approach is developed for preparing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type (Sc, Te)&#8208;doped Mg3Sb2 thermoelectric materials that show a high optimal thermoelectric figure of merit zT of about 1.5 and a high average zT of about 0.9 at 300&#8211;725&#8197;K. The approach provides a new avenue for the rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 thermoelectrics.







Abstract
n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8208;based compounds have emerged as a promising class of low&#8208;cost thermoelectric materials due to their extraordinary performance at low and intermediate temperatures. However, so far, high thermoelectric performance has merely been reported in n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8208;Mg3Bi2 alloys with a large amount of Bi. Moreover, current synthesis methods of n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 bulk thermoelectrics involve multi&#8208;step processes that are time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming. Herein, we report a fast and straightforward approach to fabricate n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 thermoelectrics using spark plasma sintering, which combines the synthesis and compaction in one step. Using this method, we achieve a high thermoelectric figure of merit zT of about 0.4&#8211;1.5 at 300&#8211;725&#8197;K in n&#8208;type (Sc, Te)&#8208;co&#8208;doped Mg3Sb2 without alloying with Mg3Bi2. In comparison with the currently reported synthesis methods, the complexity, process time, and cost of our method are significantly reduced. This work demonstrates a simple, low&#8208;cost route for the potential large&#8208;scale production of n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 thermoelectrics.

      <title>A Multidirectional Superelastic Organic Crystal by Versatile Ferroelastical Manipulation</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend into shape: A single crystal of 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)urea has been shown to demonstrate superelasticity (SE) in one direction and ferroelasticity (FE) in two other directions as a result of mechanical twinning. The crystal underwent stepwise twinning and ferroelastically formed various shapes with multiple domains oriented in different directions, which resulted in the crystal showing superelasticity in multiple directions.







Abstract
Mechanical twinning changes atomic, molecular, and crystal orientations along with directions of the anisotropic properties of the crystalline materials while maintaining single crystallinity in each domain. However, such deformability has been less studied in brittle organic crystals despite their remarkable anisotropic functions. Herein we demonstrate a direction&#8208;dependent mechanical twinning that shows superelasticity in one direction and ferroelasticity in two other directions in a single crystal of 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)urea. The crystal can undergo stepwise twinning and ferroelastically forms various shapes with multiple domains oriented in different directions, thereby affording a crystal that shows superelasticity in multiple directions. This adaptability and shape recoverability in a ferroelastic and superelastic single crystal under ambient conditions are of great importance in future applications of organic crystals as mechanical materials, such as in soft robotics.

Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) are an important class of compounds in materials science. Reported here is a new aza&#8208;annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (aza&#8208;APEX) reaction that allows rapid access to a range of N&#8208;PACs in 11&#8211;84&#8201;% yields from readily available unfunctionalized aromatics and imidoyl chlorides. In the presence of silver hexafluorophosphate, arenes and imidoyl chlorides couple in a regioselective fashion. The follow&#8208;up oxidative treatment with p&#8208;chloranil affords structurally diverse N&#8208;PACs, which are very difficult to synthesize. DFT calculations reveal that the aza&#8208;APEX reaction proceeds through the formal [4+2] cycloaddition of an arene and an in situ generated diarylnitrilium salt, with sequential aromatizations having relatively low activation energies. Transformation of N&#8208;PACs into nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographenes and their photophysical properties are also described.

      <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Nonheme Iron Oxidation Catalysis: Involvement of Oxoiron(V) Oxidants in Cleaving Strong C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of bio&#8208;inspired catalytic nonheme iron systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. This Review highlights recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the pathways that can be accessed by these systems to form high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.







Abstract
Nonheme iron enzymes generate powerful and versatile oxidants that perform a wide range of oxidation reactions, including the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds, which is a major challenge for chemists. The oxidative abilities of these enzymes have inspired bioinorganic chemists to design synthetic models to mimic their ability to perform some of the most difficult oxidation reactions and study the mechanisms of such transformations. Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of these bio&#8208;inspired catalytic systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. In this Review, we highlight the recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the various pathways that can be accessed by bio&#8208;inspired nonheme iron systems to form the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates&lt;/b&gt; like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of bio&#8208;inspired catalytic nonheme iron systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. This Review highlights recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the pathways that can be accessed by these systems to form high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonheme iron enzymes generate powerful and versatile oxidants that perform a wide range of oxidation reactions, including the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds, which is a major challenge for chemists. The oxidative abilities of these enzymes have inspired bioinorganic chemists to design synthetic models to mimic their ability to perform some of the most difficult oxidation reactions and study the mechanisms of such transformations. Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of these bio&#8208;inspired catalytic systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. In this Review, we highlight the recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the various pathways that can be accessed by bio&#8208;inspired nonheme iron systems to form the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automated, Accelerated Nanoscale Synthesis of Iminopyrrolidines</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi&#8208;3&#8208;component reaction is described.

Abstract
Miniaturization and acceleration of synthetic chemistry is an emerging area in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials research and development. Herein, we describe the synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi&#8208;3&#8208;component reaction. We used I&#8208;DOT, a positive&#8208;pressure&#8208;based low&#8208;volume and non&#8208;contact dispensing technology to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. In general, the reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups. We exemplify a pipeline of fast and efficient nanomole&#8208;scale scouting to millimole&#8208;scale synthesis for the discovery of a useful novel reaction with great scope.

Transmission electron microscopy images reveal pronounced changes in nanosheet thickness, aspect ratio and roughness indicating that nanosheet coarsening and the associated changes in the external (mesoporous) surface structure are responsible for the changes in the external surface catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol alkylation with mesitylene.

      <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Driven Cation Exchange as a Powerful Tool for Rational Design of Active CO2 Reduction Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Metal oxides/sulfides are considered one of the most promising CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) precatalysts, due to their in&#8208;situ electrochemical conversion into highly&#8208;active electrocatalytic species. Yet, further leap in performance requires new tools for gaining fine&#8208;control over the active species composition and structural features (e.g., grain boundaries (GBs) and undercoordinated sites (USs)), directly from a pre&#8208;designed template material. Here, we developed a novel electrochemically&#8208;driven cation exchange (ED&#8208;CE) method, enabling the conversion of a pre&#8208;designed CoS  2  template into a CO  2  RR catalyst, Cu  2  S. Via ED&#8208;CE, the final Cu  2  S catalyst inherited the CoS  2  &#8217;s original 3D morphology, and preserved its high&#8208;density of GBs. Additionally, the catalyst&#8217;s phase&#8208;structure, composition and density of USs were precisely tuned, thus enabling rational design of active CO  2  RR sites. The obtained Cu  2  S catalyst reach a CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;formate Faradaic efficiency of over 87% and a record&#8208;high activity (among reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts). Hence, this study opens a path for the utilization of ED&#8208;CE reactions to design advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal oxides/sulfides are considered one of the most promising CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) precatalysts, due to their in&#8208;situ electrochemical conversion into highly&#8208;active electrocatalytic species. Yet, further leap in performance requires new tools for gaining fine&#8208;control over the active species composition and structural features (e.g., grain boundaries (GBs) and undercoordinated sites (USs)), directly from a pre&#8208;designed template material. Here, we developed a novel electrochemically&#8208;driven cation exchange (ED&#8208;CE) method, enabling the conversion of a pre&#8208;designed CoS  2  template into a CO  2  RR catalyst, Cu  2  S. Via ED&#8208;CE, the final Cu  2  S catalyst inherited the CoS  2  &#8217;s original 3D morphology, and preserved its high&#8208;density of GBs. Additionally, the catalyst&#8217;s phase&#8208;structure, composition and density of USs were precisely tuned, thus enabling rational design of active CO  2  RR sites. The obtained Cu  2  S catalyst reach a CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;formate Faradaic efficiency of over 87% and a record&#8208;high activity (among reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts). Hence, this study opens a path for the utilization of ED&#8208;CE reactions to design advanced electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Free Energy of Local Biological Water</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we propose an experimental methodology based on femtosecond&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond free energy of water at protein surfaces under isothermal conditions. A demonstration was conducted by installing a non&#8208;canonical isostere of tryptophan (7&#8208;azatryptophan) at the surface of a coiled&#8208;coil protein to exploit the photoinduced proton transfer of its chromophoric moiety, 7&#8208;azaindole. The H&#8208;bond free energy of such biological water was evaluated by comparing the rates of the proton transfer, sensitive to the hydration environment, at the protein surface and in bulk water, and it was found to be higher than that of bulk water by 0.4 kcal/mol. The free&#8208;energy difference is dominated by the entropic cost in the H&#8208;bond network among water molecules at the hydrophilic and charged protein surface. Our study opens a door to accessing the energetics and dynamics of local biological water to give insight its roles in protein structure and function.</dc:description>

      <title>An Excimer Clamp for Measuring Damaged Base Excision by the DNA Repair Enzyme NTH1</title>
      <dc:description>Direct measurement of DNA repair enzyme activities is important both for basic study of cellular repair pathways as well as for potential new translational applications in their associated diseases. NTH1, a major glycosylase targeting oxidized pyrimidines, prevents mutations arising from this damage, and the regulation of NTH1 activity is important in resisting oxidative stress and in suppressing tumor formation. Here we describe a novel molecular strategy for the direct detection of damaged DNA base excision activity by a ratiometric fluorescence change.This strategy utilizes glycosylation&#8208;induced excimer formation of pyrenes, and modified DNA probes incorporating two pyrene deoxynucleotides and a damaged base enable the direct, real&#8208;time detection of NTH1 activity  in vitro  and in cellular lysates.

      <title>Continuous and Segmented Semiconducting Fiber&#8208;like Nanostructures with Spatially Selective Functionalization by Living Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Uniform continuous and segmented semiconducting hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures of controlled length and composition consisting of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV core and P2VP coronas selectively decorated with diverse functional moieties were prepared by living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uniform&lt;/b&gt; continuous and segmented semiconducting hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures of controlled length and composition consisting of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV core and P2VP coronas selectively decorated with diverse functional moieties were prepared by living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer of oligo(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (OPV&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P2VP&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;), in which the basicity and coordinating/chelating ability of the P2VP segment provide a landscape for the incorporation of a variety of functional inorganic NPs.

      <title>A Periodic System of Supramolecular Elements</title>
      <dc:description>
All systems go: Increased research on large molecules will reveal construction principles dictated by recurring motifs that govern structure formation through folding and self&#8208;assembly. These principles are comparable to the organization of atoms in the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements and could lead to the establishment of a Periodic System of Supramolecular Elements.







Abstract
Chemistry &#8220;beyond the molecule&#8221; is based on weak, noncovalent, and reversible interactions. As a consequence of these bonds being weak, structural organization by folding and self&#8208;assembly can only be fully exploited with larger molecules that can provide multiple binding sites. Such &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; can now be synthesized and their folding into desired conformations predicted. A new level of chemistry can now be realized through the creation of non&#8208;natural entities composed of molecular building blocks with defined secondary structures. Herein we define these building blocks as &#8220;supramolecular elements&#8221;. We anticipate that further research on such large molecules will reveal construction principles dictated by recurring motifs that govern structure formation through folding and self&#8208;assembly. These principles are comparable to the organization of atoms in the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements and may lead to the establishment of a Periodic System of Supramolecular Elements.

      <title>An Indium&#8208;Seamed Hexameric Metal&#8211;Organic Cage as an Example of a Hexameric Pyrogallol[4]arene Capsule Conjoined Exclusively by Trivalent Metal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Zip it up: The formation of a pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC5)&#8208;based indium&#8208;seamed hexameric capsule is presented. The reaction involves stitching of 6 PgC5 macrocycles by 24 InIII ions to form the supramolecular structure.







Abstract
A hexameric metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule is assembled from pyrogallol[4]arene units, which are stitched together with indium ions. This indium&#8208;seamed capsule is the first instance of a M24L6 type hexameric coordination cage held together exclusively by trivalent metal ions. Explicitly, unlike previously reported pyrogallol[4]arene&#8208;based metal&#8208;seamed capsules, the current In3+ seamed capsule is entirely supported by O&#8594;In coordinate bonds. This work demonstrates the important proof of concept of the ability of pyrogallol[4]arene to react with metals in higher oxidation states to assemble into atomically&#8208;precise hexameric coordination cages. As such, these results open up exciting avenues toward the assembly of previously unanticipated metal&#8211;organic capsules, for example offering inspiration for tackling metals exhibiting high valence states such as in the lanthanide and actinide series.

      <title>Structure of a Protein&#8211;RNA Complex by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
An approach to determine the structure of protein&#8211;RNA complexes by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is described. The method is based on paramagnetic relaxation enhancement effects elicited on the RNA by the spin&#8208;labeled protein, and on chemical shift perturbations. This method offers unprecedented access to specific protein&#8211;RNA interactions in large complexes.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight (MW) protein assemblies in a non&#8208;amorphous precipitate. The technique yields atomic resolution structural information on both soluble and insoluble particles without limitations of MW or requirement of crystals. Herein, we propose and demonstrate an approach that yields the structure of protein&#8211;RNA complexes (RNP) solely from ssNMR data. Instead of using low&#8208;sensitivity magnetization transfer steps between heteronuclei of the protein and the RNA, we measure paramagnetic relaxation enhancement effects elicited on the RNA by a paramagnetic tag coupled to the protein. We demonstrate that this data, together with chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;perturbation data, yields an accurate structure of an RNP complex, starting from the bound structures of its components. The possibility of characterizing protein&#8211;RNA interactions by ssNMR may enable applications to large RNP complexes, whose structures are not accessible by other methods.

      <title>Enabling a Durable Electrochemical Interface via an Artificial Amorphous Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for Hybrid Solid/Liquid Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The CEI's advantage: An amorphous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with superior chemical compatibility and plasticity was formed via in&#8197;situ LiDFOB conversion. It endows high&#8208;voltage hybrid solid/liquid batteries with significantly enhanced interfacial stability, durability, and dynamics.







Abstract
A hybrid solid/liquid electrolyte with superior security facilitates the implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices, but it suffers from inferior chemical compatibility with cathodes. Herein, an optimal lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate salt was introduced to build in&#8197;situ an amorphous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) between Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and hybrid electrolyte. The CEI preserves the surface structure with high compatibility, leading to enhanced interfacial stability. Meanwhile, the space&#8208;charge layer can be prominently mitigated at the solid/solid interface via harmonized chemical potentials, acquiring promoted interfacial dynamics as revealed by COMSOL simulation. Consequently, the amorphous CEI integrates the bifunctionality to provide an excellent cycling stability, high Coulombic efficiency, and favorable rate capability in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries, innovating the design philosophy of functional CEI strategy for future high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

To gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of catalyst durability for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with an ammonia reductant, we employed scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) to study Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites with the CHA and MFI framework structures before and after simulated 135&#8201;000&#8208;mile aging. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) measurements were performed at the Al&#8197;K&#8208; and Cu&#8197;L&#8208;edges. The local environment of framework Al, the oxidation state of Cu, and geometric changes were analyzed, showing a multi&#8208;factor&#8208;induced catalytic deactivation. In Cu&#8208;exchanged MFI, a transformation of CuII to CuI and CuxOy was observed. We also found a spatial correlation between extra&#8208;framework Al and deactivated Cu species near the surface of the zeolite as well as a weak positive correlation between the amount of CuI and tri&#8208;coordinated Al. By inspecting both Al and Cu in fresh and aged Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites, we conclude that the importance of the preservation of isolated CuII sites trumps that of Br&#248;nsted acid sites for NH3&#8208;SCR activity.

      <title>Unraveling the Impact of Gold(I)&#8211;Thiolate Motifs on the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning gold: Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of Au nanoclusters (NCs) is adjustable from visible to the near&#8208;infrared II region by controlling the length of the AuI&#8211;thiolate motifs on the NC surface. Decreasing the length of AuI&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au0&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides an efficient strategy to synthesize highly luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs), however, rational control of emission energy and intensity of metal NCs is still challenging. This communication reveals the impact of surface AuI&#8208;thiolate motifs on the AIE properties of Au NCs, by employing a series of water&#8208;soluble glutathione (GSH)&#8208;coordinated Au complexes and NCs as a model ([Au10SR10], [Au15SR13], [Au18SR14], and [Au25SR18]&#8722;, SR=thiolate ligand). Spectroscopic investigations show that the emission wavelength of Au NCs is adjustable from visible to the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) region by controlling the length of the AuI&#8208;SR motifs on the NC surface. Decreasing the length of AuI&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au0&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence. This effect becomes more prominent when the degree of aggregation of Au NCs increases in solution.

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Supported Facile Conversion of Uranyl(VI) into Uranium(IV) in Organic and Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>
Going for a swim: A picolinate complex of UVIO22+ is slowly converted by Na2S2O4 into a water&#8208;insoluble trinuclear UIV oxo hydroxo cluster via a stable UVO2+ intermediate. It is the first example of conversion of a uranyl(VI) compound into a well&#8208;defined molecular UIV species in aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Reduction of uranyl(VI) to UV and to UIV is important in uranium environmental migration and remediation processes. The anaerobic reduction of a uranyl UVI complex supported by a picolinate ligand in both organic and aqueous media is presented. The [UVIO2(dpaea)] complex is readily converted into the cis&#8208;boroxide UIV species via diborane&#8208;mediated reductive functionalization in organic media. Remarkably, in aqueous media the uranyl(VI) complex is rapidly converted, by Na2S2O4, a reductant relevant for chemical remediation processes, into the stable uranyl(V) analogue, which is then slowly reduced to yield a water&#8208;insoluble trinuclear UIV oxo&#8208;hydroxo cluster. This report provides the first example of direct conversion of a uranyl(VI) compound into a well&#8208;defined molecular UIV species in aqueous conditions.

      <title>Semisynthetic and Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Conjugate Preparations Illuminate the Ubiquitination&#8208;Dependent Aggregation of Tau Protein</title>
      <dc:description>
Shedding light on Alzheimer: Semisynthetic and enzyme&#8208;based conjugation methods were applied to interrogate, at the molecular level, the effects of ubiquitin modification on aberrant aggregation of tau protein in neurodegeneration.







Abstract
In the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, the regulatory protein ubiquitin is found conjugated to different lysine residues of tau protein assembled into pathological paired helical filaments. To shed light on the hitherto unexplored ubiquitination&#8208;linked conformational transitions of tau, the availability of in vitro ubiquitin conjugation methods is of primary importance. In our work, we focused on the four&#8208;repeat domain of tau and assembled an enzymatic machinery formed by UBE1, Ubc13, and CHIP enzymes. The enzymatic reaction resulted in monoubiquitination at multiple sites, reminiscent of the ubiquitination pattern observed in vivo. We further exploited chemoselective disulfide coupling reactions to construct three tau regioisomers with site&#8208;specific monoubiquitination. Protein aggregation experiments revealed that the multiple enzyme&#8208;derived products were unable to convert into amyloid fibrils, while the semisynthetic conjugates exhibited diverse capability to form filaments. This study contributes novel insight into the effects of a key post&#8208;translational modification on aberrant protein self&#8208;assembly.

      <title>Spatially Controlled Supramolecular Polymerization of Peptide Nanotubes by Microfluidics</title>
      <dc:description>
Spatially regulated assembly of synthetic supramolecular fibers is controlled in a microfluidic device. Modulation of chemical triggers such as pH or ionic strength allowed the spatial organization of supramolecular fibers confined in water droplets. 2D suprastructures can be assembled by controlling the organization of droplet and fibrillar assembly.







Abstract
Despite the importance of spatially resolved self&#8208;assembly for molecular machines, the spatial control of supramolecular polymerization with synthetic monomers had not been experimentally established. Now, a microfluidic&#8208;regulated tandem process of supramolecular polymerization and droplet encapsulation is used to control the position of self&#8208;assembled microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes in water droplets. This method allows the precise preferential localization of fibers either at the interface or into the core of the droplets. UV absorbance, circular dichroism and fluorescence microscopy indicated that the microfluidic control of the stimuli (changes in pH or ionic strength) can be employed to adjust the packing degree and the spatial position of microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes. Additionally, this spatially organized supramolecular polymerization of peptide nanotubes was applied in the assembly of highly ordered two&#8208;dimensional droplet networks.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spatially regulated assembly&lt;/b&gt; of synthetic supramolecular fibers is controlled in a microfluidic device. Modulation of chemical triggers such as pH or ionic strength allowed the spatial organization of supramolecular fibers confined in water droplets. 2D suprastructures can be assembled by controlling the organization of droplet and fibrillar assembly.

      <title>Ligand Crosslinking Boosts Thermal Transport in Colloidal Nanocrystal Solids</title>
      <dc:description>The ongoing interest in colloidal nanocrystal solids for electronic and photonic devices necessitates that their thermal transport properties be well understood because heat dissipation frequently limits performance in these devices. Unfortunately, colloidal nanocrystal solids generally possess very low thermal conductivities. This very low thermal conductivity primarily results from the weak van der Waals interaction between the ligands of adjacent nanocrystals. We overcome this thermal transport bottleneck by crosslinking the ligands, which exchanges a weak van der Waals interaction with a strong covalent bond. We obtain thermal conductivities of up to 1.7 Wm  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  that exceed prior reported values by a factor of 4. This improvement is significant because the entire range of prior reported values themselves only span a factor of 4 (i.e., 0.1 &#8211; 0.4 Wm  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  ). We complement our thermal conductivity measurements with mechanical nanoindentation measurements that demonstrate ligand crosslinking increases Young&#8217;s modulus and sound velocity. This increase in sound velocity is a key bridge between mechanical and thermal properties because sound velocity and thermal conductivity are linearly proportional according to kinetic theory. Control experiments with non&#8208;crosslinkable ligands as well as transport modeling further confirm ligand crosslinking boosts thermal transport.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The competition between honeycomb and hexagonal tiling of molecular units can lead to large honeycomb superstructures on surfaces. Such superstructures exhibit pores that may be used as two&#8208;dimensional templates for functional guest molecules. We present honeycomb superstructures of molecules that comprise a&#160; C3&#160; symmetric platform on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. The superstructures cover nearly mesoscopic areas with unit cells containing up to 3000 molecules, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The unit cell size may be controlled via the coverage. We developed a fairly general model that describes the energetics of honeycomb superstructures built from&#160; C3&#160; symmetric units. Based on three parameters that characterize two competing bonding arrangements, the model is consistent with the present experimental results and also reproduces various published results. The model identifies the relevant driving force, mostly related to geometric aspects, of the pattern formation.

      <title>Modular Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Terpenes and their Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;natural terpenoids have been demonstrated to offer potential as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the chemical syntheses required for their generation are often long, complex and not easily amenable to large&#8208;scale production.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non&#8208;natural terpenoids have been demonstrated to offer potential as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the chemical syntheses required for their generation are often long, complex and not easily amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Here we report a modular chemoenzymatic approach to synthesize terpene analogues from diphosphorylated precursors produced in quantitative yields. Through the addition of prenyl transferases, farnesyl diphosphates, (2E,6E)&#8208;FDP and (2Z,6Z)&#8208;FDP were isolated in &amp;gt;80% yields.

      <dc:description>Chaos and natural evolution of tumor system have become two reasons of the failure of tumor therapies. Selectively targeting chaotic tumor systems to induce a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; is promising in constructing non&#8208;interventional and effective strategy for tumor therapy. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that iridium oxide nanoparticles (IrO x  ) possess acid&#8208;activated oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like functions and wide pH&#8208;dependent catalase&#8208;like properties. Integrating of glucose oxidase (GOD) could unlock its oxidase and peroxidase activities by gluconic acid produced by catalysis of GOD towards glucose in cancer cells, and the produced H 2  O 2  can be converted to O 2  to compensate its consumption in GOD catalysis due to the catalase&#8208;like function of the nanozyme, which result in continual consumption of glucose and self&#8208;supplied substrates for generating superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. Moreover, IrO x  can constantly consume glutathione (GSH) by self&#8208;cyclic valence alteration of Ir (IV) and Ir (III), greatly reducing the anti&#8208;oxidation defense effect of tumor. Consequently, these self&#8208;cyclic parallel cascaded reactions due to the introduction of IrO x  &#8208;GOD into chaotic tumor lead to a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of initial starvation therapy and subsequent multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) pressure, completely break the self&#8208;adaption of cancer cells compared to traditional ROS&#8208; and GSH&#8208; targeted therapies, providing new conceptual thinkings for non&#8208;interventional and precise cancer therapy against the resistance.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Conversion and Reaction Mechanism of Propargylic Amines and CO2 Catalyzed by Eco&#8208;Friendly Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free [Zn116] Nanocages</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of propargylic amines and CO  2  can efficiently reduce the release to carbon dioxide&#160;and provide many high value&#8208;added chemical products. Nevertheless most of catalysts in such reaction were associated with noble&#8208;metal to obtain high yield, and it is necessary and important to seek eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs catalysts, but have not been reported so far. Here a giant and lantern&#8208;like [Zn  116  ] nanocage in zinc&#8208;tetrazole 3D framework [Zn  22  (Trz)  8  (OH)  12  (H  2  O)  9  &#183;8H  2  O]  n  Trz = (C  4  N  12  O)  4&#8208;  (  1  ) was obtained and structurally characterized, which is consisted of six [Zn  14  O  21  ] clusters and eight [Zn  4  O  4  ] clusters. To our knowledge, this is the highest nuclearity nanocages constructed by Zn&#8208;clusters as building blocks to date. Importantly, catalytic investigations reveals that  1  can efficiently and circularly catalyze the cycloaddition of propargylic amines with CO  2  , exclusively affording various 2&#8208;oxazolidinones under mild conditions. It is the first eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs catalyst for the cyclization of propargylic amines with CO  2  , which opens a wide space in accelerating the chemical conversion of CO  2  . The density functional theory (DFT) calculations uncover that Zn(II) ions can efficiently activate both C&#8801;C bonds of propargylic amines and CO  2  by coordination interaction, forming quite short Zn&#8208;O bonds and bent configuration with bond angle of 167.2&#176;. NMR and FTIR spectroscopy further prove that Zn&#8208;clusters play an important role in activating C&#8801;C bonds of propargylic amines. Furthermore, the electronic properties of related reactants, intermediates and products can help to understand the basic reaction mechanism and crucial role of catalyst  1  .</dc:description>

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Activation at Metal Centers: Evolution of Charge Transfer from Mg+ to CO2 in [MgCO2(H2O)n]+, n = 0&#8211;8</title>
      <dc:description>We investigate activation of carbon dioxide by singly charged hydrated magnesium cations Mg&#8226;+(H2O)n, through infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The spectra of [MgCO2(H2O)n]&#8226;+ in the 1250&#8211;4000 cm&#8211;1 region show a sharp transition from n&#160;=&#160;2 to n&#160;=&#160;3 for the position of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode. This is evidence for the activation of CO2 via charge transfer from Mg&#8226;+ to CO2 for n &#8805; 3, while smaller clusters feature linear CO2 coordinated end&#8208;on to the metal center. Starting with n&#160;=&#160;5, we see a further conformational change, with CO2&#8226;&#8211; coordination to Mg2+ gradually shifting from bidentate to monodentate, consistent with preferential hexa&#8208;coordination of Mg2+. Our results reveal in detail how hydration promotes CO2 activation by charge transfer at metal centers.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In order to facilitate the  in vitro  visualization of K  Ca  3.1 channel&#8208;expressing cells, novel small&#8208;molecule imaging probes were designed and developed. Senicapoc showing high affinity and excellent selectivity towards the K  Ca  3.1 channels was selected as targeting component. Different BODIPY dyes (  15  &#8208;  20  ) were synthesized and connected by a Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne [3+2]cycloaddition with propargyl ether derivative  8  of senicapoc yielding fluorescently labeled ligands  21  &#8208;  26  targeting K  Ca  3.1 channels. The novel dimethylpyrrole&#8208;based imaging probes  25  and  26  allow staining of K  Ca  3.1 ion channels in NSCLC cells following a simple, fast and efficient protocol. The specificity was shown by removing the punctate staining pattern by pre&#8208;incubation with senicapoc. The density of K  Ca  3.1 channels detected with fluorescent probe  25  and by immunostaining was identical. The punctate structure of the labeled channels could be observed in living cells as well.

      <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA Functionalization of Upconversion Nanoparticles and Their Programmable Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>DNA&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (DNA&#8208;UCNPs) that combine DNA&#8217;s function and optical feature of UCNPs together have shown great promise in the fields of new material design, photonic devices, bioimaging, and disease treatment. However, challenges remain in precisely tethering and orientating the DNA strands on UCNP surface. Herein, we systematically investigate the sequence dependence of DNAs in their interactions with UCNPs, and reveal that poly&#8208;cytosine (poly&#8208;C) has specifically high affinity to UCNP surface. Based on this discovery, we develop a general approach to synthesize monodispersed DNA&#8208;UCNP conjugates using poly&#8208;C containing &#8220;diblock&#8221; DNA strands. High binding affinity of poly&#8208;C segment enables its competitive and firm tethering on the surfaces of UCNPs with different sizes, shapes, and luminescence. Consequently, the second block of used DNA strands with lower affinity would tightly and perpendicularly orientate on UCNP surface, making the DNA&#8208;UCNPs highly stable and monodispersed in aqueous solution. With complementary designed sequences, the dense layer of extruding DNA segments on UCNP surface allows the particles programmably assemble with other DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles or DNA origamis through hybridizations, resulting in the formation of well&#8208;organized complex structures.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;throughput Proteomics Enabled by a Photocleavable Surfactant</title>
      <dc:description>Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based proteomics provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding the structure and function of proteins in complex biological systems; however, protein solubility and sample preparation before MS analysis remain a bottleneck preventing high&#8208;throughput proteomics.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report for the first time a high&#8208;throughput bottom&#8208;up proteomics method enabled by a newly developed MS&#8208;compatible photocleavable surfactant,&#160;4&#8208;hexylphenylazosulfonate (Azo)    [1]    &#160;that facilitates robust protein extraction, rapid enzymatic digestion (30 min compared to overnight), and subsequent MS&#8208;analysis following UV degradation. Moreover, we developed an Azo&#8208;aided bottom&#8208;up method for efficient analysis of integral membrane proteins, which are key drug targets and are generally underrepresented in global proteomic studies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the unique ability of Azo to serve as an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; MS&#8208;compatible surfactant for both top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up proteomics, with streamlined workflows for high&#8208;throughput proteomics amenable to clinical applications.</dc:description>
