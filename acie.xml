      <title>Dimensional matching vs. induced&#8208;fit distortions. Binding affinities of planar and curved polyaromatic hydrocarbons with a tetra&#8208;gold metallorectangle</title>
      <dc:description>A tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage containing two pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands and two carbazolyl&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl linkers is used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including corannulene. The binding affinities obtained for the encapsulation of the planar PAHs guests in CD2Cl2 are found to exponentially increase with the number of p&#8208;electrons of the guest (1.3 &gt; logK &gt; 6.6). For the bowl&#8208;shaped molecule of corannulene, the association constant is much lower than the expected one according to its number of electrons. The molecular structure of the host:guest complex formed with corannulene shows that the molecule of the guest is compressed, while the host is expanded, thus showing an unusual case of artificial mutual induced&#8208;fit arrangement.</dc:description>

      <title>Directionally decorated 12&#8208;membered ring of mordenite with ZIF fragments for propene/propane separation</title>
      <dc:description>Propene/propane separation has always been a challenging endeavor due to the very small variance in molecular sizes, boiling points and condensabilities between these molecules. Herein, we report a strategy of introducing ZIF fragments into traditional mordenite (MOR) zeolite to decorate the 12&#8208;membered ring of MOR. After decoration, the originally ineffectual zeolite MOR exhibited high kinetic propene/propane selectivities (139 at 25 &#176;C) and achieved efficient propene/propane separation. The propene/propane separation potentials of the resulting adsorbents were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments for equimolar propene/propane (50/50) mixtures.</dc:description>

      <title>A Photochemical Organocatalytic Strategy for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones using Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>Reported herein is a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach to the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones. This method exploits the ability of a nucleophilic organocatalyst to generate radicals upon S  N  2&#8208;based activation of alkyl halides and blue light irradiation. The resulting open&#8208;shell intermediates are then intercepted by weakly nucleophilic silyl enol ethers, which would be unable to directly attack the alkyl halides through a traditional two&#8208;electron path. The method&#8217;s mild reaction conditions allowed us to functionalize the &#945; position of ketones with functional groups that are not compatible with classical anionic strategies. In addition, the redox&#8208;neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with a cinchona&#8208;based primary amine catalyst, which was used to develop a rare example of enantioselective organocatalytic radical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this study, heteroatom&#8208;containing spiropolymers were constructed in a facile manner by a catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent spiropolymerization route.  P1a2b  as the most potent of these spiropolymers, demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction,  P1a2b  triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating a good biocompatibility and non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells. The combined results from solution and cell&#8208;based cluster&#8208;triggered emission studies, docking, protein expression experiments and cytotoxicity data strongly support the MDM2&#8208;binding hypothesis and indicate a potential application as a fluorescent cancer marker as well as therapeutic for this spiropolymer.</dc:description>

      <title>A&#160;Modular Synthetic Strategy for Functional Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Reported here is a molecular&#8208;Lego synthetic strategy for macrocycles with functional skeletons, involving one&#8208;pot and high&#8208;yielding condensation between bis(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)arene monomers and paraformaldehyde. By changing the blocks, variously functional units (naphthalene, pyrene, anthraquinone, porphyrin, et. al.) can be conveniently introduced into the backbone of macrocycles. Interestingly, the macrocyclization can be tuned by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. Linear (180  o  ) monomer yield cyclic trimers and pentamers, while V&#8208;shaped (120  o  , 90  o  and 60  o  ) monomers tend to form dimers. More significantly, even heterogeneous macrocycles are obtained in moderate yield by co&#8208;oligomerization of different monomers. This&#160;series of macrocycles have the potential to be considerably prosperous in the near future.</dc:description>

      <title>An Enzymatic N&#8208;Acylation Step Enables the Biocatalytic Synthesis of Unnatural Sialosides</title>
      <dc:description>
The selective N&#8208;acylation of glucosamine with unprotected carboxylic acids enables the biosynthesis of unnatural glycosides and their subsequent enzymatic modification. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914338), L. Liu, S.&#8197;L. Flitsch, J. Voglmeir et&#8197;al. report that the enzyme chitobiose deacetylase from Cyclobacterium marinum has promiscuous N&#8208;acylation activity without the need for activation of the acid. This selective N&#8208;acylation step provides the last missing link for the fully enzymatic multistep synthesis of C5&#8208;modified sialosides from chitin.

      <title>The Ultimate Method for the Programmed Synthesis of Mutifunctional Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrroles from aldehydes, primary amines, nitriles and diethyl oxalacetate has been developed. It is now possible to prepare diketopyrrolopyrroles bearing an ordered arrangement of three different substituents from abundant and commercially available materials allowing the independent regulation of all desired physicochemical properties. For the first time very electron&#8208;rich (carbazo&#8208;3&#8208;yl, dimethylaminophenyl, pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;  b  ]pyrrolyl) and sterically hindered substituents (naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl, quinolin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, acridin&#8208;9&#8208;yl, imidazo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;yl, 2&#8208;bromophenyl, etc.) can be appended to the diketopyrrolopyrrole core  via  condensation of an appropriate nitrile with a pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. Even greater synthetic possibilities are related to the fact that such demanding substituents as 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl, indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl and 2&#8208;methoxyphenyl can be incorporated from aldehyde precursors, bypassing problems with the nitriles reactivity. Starting from terephthaldehyde, previously inaccessible bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrroles can also be obtained. The ability to incorporate an unprecedented variety of substituents translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties such as shifting the absorption and emission across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching the highest recorded Stokes shift for a diketopyrrolopyrrole (5800 cm  &#8722;1  ) and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism.</dc:description>

      <title>A Hydrolase&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Forms the Fused Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactone in Vibralactone</title>
      <dc:description>Vibralactone is isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Boreostereum vibrans  as one of the strongest lipase inhibitors. Its unusual &#946;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused bicycle is derived from an aryl ring moiety via an oxidative ring&#8208;expansion prior to an intramolecular cyclization. Here, we report the discovery of the cyclase VibC which belongs to the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase superfamily and is involved in the vibralactone biosynthesis. Biochemical and crystal studies suggest that VibC may catalyze an aldol or an electrocyclic reaction initiated by the catalytic Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp triad. For the aldol and pericyclic chemistry in living cells, VibC is a unique hydrolase performing the carbocycle formation of an oxepinone to a fused bicyclic b&#8208;lactone. This presents a naturally occurring new enzyme reaction in both aldol and hydrolase (bio)chemistry that will guide future exploitation of these enzymes in synthetic biology for chemical diversity expansion of natural products.</dc:description>

In this work, we have developed a series of novel Au(I)&#8208;NHC compounds with AIE characteristics. Through systematic biological evaluation and comparison, complex  1  with triphenyl phosphine ligand was selected out as it could achieve both prominent specific imaging of various cancer cells and efficient inhibition of their growth with negligible toxic effects on normal cells due to the targeting binding and strong inhibition towards thioredoxin reductase. Complex  1  could also act as a powerful radiosensitizers to boost the anticancer efficacy with performance superior to that of popularly used auranofin. Thus, complex  1  holds great potential as a specific and effective theranostic drug in cancer diagnosis and precise therapy. The present work is anticipated to open a new avenue to the development of novel Au&#8208;based bioprobes and drug candidates.</dc:description>

      <title>The glutathione/metallothionein system challenges the design of efficient O2&#8208;activating Cu&#8208;complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Copper&#8208;complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs designed to cleave intracellular biomolecules  via  O  2  activation. To exhibit such activity, the copper complex must be redox&#8208;active and resistant to dissociation. Metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are abundant in the cytosol and nucleus. Because they also are thiol&#8208;rich reducing molecules with high Cu  I  &#8208;affinity, they are potential competitors for copper ion bound in a copper drug. Here, we investigated a panel of Cu  I  / Cu  II  &#8208;complexes often used as drugs, from various classes, with diverse coordination chemistries and redox potentials. We evaluated their catalytic activity in ascorbate oxidation based on redox&#8208;cycling between Cu  I  and Cu  II  , as well as their resistance to dissociation or inactivation under cytosolically&#8208;relevant concentrations of GSH and MT. Our findings show that O  2  &#8208;activating Cu  I  / Cu  II  &#8208;complexes for cytosolic/nuclear targets are generally not stable against the GSH/MT system, which creates a challenge for their future design.</dc:description>

      <title>A Universal Strategy toward Ultrasmall Hollow Nanostructures with Remarkable Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Hollow nanostructures have shown enormous potentials in many fields, but the convenient synthesis of ultrasmall hollow nanostructures with a wide range of compositions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report a facile and versatile microwave&#8208;assisted and shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy to fabricate a variety of ultrasmall hollow nanoparticles by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene. Unlike traditional thermal treat route, our method involves that the adsorption of microwave by graphene creates a high&#8208;energy environment in a short time to decompose the in&#8208;situ grown MOF nanocrystals into well&#8208;dispersed uniform core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with ultrasmall size rather than large aggregated particles. Upon a newly disclosed shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion process, a series of hollow nanoparticles of multi&#8208;metal oxides, phosphides, and sulfides with the diameter below 20 nm and shell thickness below 3 nm can be successfully obtained for the first time. We further revealed that ultrasmall hollow nanostructure such as Fe  2  O  3  can promote much faster charge transport and expose more active sites as well as migrate the volume change stress more efficiently than the solid and large hollow counterparts, thus demonstrating remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage performance including ultrahigh reversible capacity (1167 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  ), excellent rate performance (701 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ) and outstanding cycling stability (97.8% after 1200 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ), which is among the best results reported so far.

      <title>Spatial Manipulation and Integration of Supramolecular Filaments on Hydrogel Substrates towards Advanced Soft Devices</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular assemblies are promising building blocks for the fabrication of functional soft devices for high&#8208;tech applications. However, the lack of effective methods for large&#8208;scale manipulation and integration of nano&#8208;sized supramolecular structures on soft substrate has greatly hindered the access to such goals. Here, we show how functional soft devices composed of micellar filaments and hydrogels can be created through a versatile approach involving guided dewetting, transfer&#8208;printing and laser&#8208;assisted patterning strategies. Such an approach enables unprecedented control over the location and alignment of the micellar filaments on hydrogel substrates. As examples, freely suspended micellar &#8220;fishnet&#8221; immobilized on hydrogels are formed, showing the capability of trapping and releasing micro&#8208;objects and the piconewton force sensitivity. Additionally, by incorporating responsive moieties into hydrogels, shape&#8208;morphing actuators with micelle&#8208;controlled rolling directionality are successfully constructed. We believe that this strategy paves the way towards functional soft devices for, for instance, the fundamental studies on supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Native S&#8208;Palmitoylated Membrane Proteins through Removable&#8208;Backbone&#8208;Modification&#8208;Assisted Ser/Thr Ligation</title>
      <dc:description>
Native proteins by non&#8208;native methods: An RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL strategy (removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted serine/threonine ligation) was developed for the chemical synthesis of native S&#8208;palmitoylated membrane proteins, which have not previously been accessible through chemical synthesis. The successful synthesis of S&#8208;palmitoylated sarcolipin and M2 demonstrates the importance of non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.







Abstract
The preparation of native S&#8208;palmitoylated (S&#8208;palm) membrane proteins is one of the unsolved challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, we report the first chemical synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins by removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted Ser/Thr ligation (RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL). This method involves two critical steps: 1)&#8197;synthesis of S&#8208;palm peptides by a new &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid based RBM (RBMGABA) strategy, and 2)&#8197;ligation of the S&#8208;palm RBM&#8208;modified peptides to give the desired S&#8208;palm product by the STL method. The utility of the RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL method was demonstrated by the synthesis of rabbit S&#8208;palm sarcolipin (SLN) and S&#8208;palm matrix&#8208;2 (M2) ion channel. The synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins highlights the importance of developing non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.

Spatially resolved covalent patterning of graphene is achieved based on three important reaction principles: reductive activation of the carbon lattice, antaratopic binding, and classical lithography. As shown by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914088), reversible defunctionalization of the patterned graphene allows the storage of chemical information by establishing complete write/store/erase cycles.

Near 275&#8197;K, the material undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for use in innovative applications.

      <title>A Glutathione Activatable Ion Channel Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells by Depleting Intracellular Glutathione Levels</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic Cancer cells use elevated glutathione (GSH) levels as an inner line of defense to evade apoptosis and develop drug resistance. In this study, we describe a novel 2,4&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNS) protected 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide system that exploits GSH for its activation into free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide forming supramolecular M+/Cl&#8210;  channels. Better permeation of the DNS protected compound into MCF&#8208;7 cells compared to the free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide and GSH&#8208;activatable ion transport resulted in higher cytotoxicity, which was associated with increased oxidative stress that further reduced the intracellular GSH levels and altered mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The GSH&#8208;activatable transport&#8208;mediated cell death was further validated in rat insulinoma cells (INS&#8208;1E); wherein the intracellular GSH levels showed a direct correlation to the resulting cytotoxicity. Lastly, the active compound was found to restrict the growth and proliferation of 3D spheroids of MCF&#8208;7 cells with efficiency similar to that of the anticancer drug doxorubicin.</dc:description>

      <title>Ligand Effects on the Electronic Structure of Heteroleptic Antimony&#8208;centered Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the structures of three unprecedented heteroleptic Sb&#8208;centered radicals L(Cl)GaSb R  (2&#8208;R,  R  = B[N(Dip)CH]22&#8208;B, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H32&#8208;C, N(SiMe3)Dip 2&#8208;N) stabilized by one electropositive metal fragment [L(Cl)Ga] (L = HC[C(Me)N(Dip)]2, Dip = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) and one bulky B&#8208; (2&#8208;B), C&#8208; (2&#8208;C), or N&#8208;based (2&#8208;N) substituent. Compounds 2&#8208;R are predominantly metal&#8208;centered radicals. Their electronic properties are largely influenced by the electronic nature of the ligands  R , and significant delocalization of unpaired spin density onto the ligands was observed in 2&#8208;B and 2&#8208;N. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies showed that 2&#8208;B undergoes a quasi&#8208;reversible one&#8208;electron reduction, which was confirmed by the synthesis of [K([2.2.2]crypt)][L(Cl)GaSbB[N(Dip)CH]2] ([K([2.2.2]crypt)][2&#8208;B]) containing the stibanyl anion [2&#8208;B]&#8722;, which was shown to possess significant Sb&#8208;B multiple bonding character.</dc:description>

With nearly 20&#8208;year development, AIE research has made great achievements in material development, mechanistic study and high&#8208;tech applications. And the achievements of AIE research demonstrate that molecular aggregates show many behaviors and functions that are absent in molecular species. In this review, we summarized the advancement of AIE and its branched areas.

      <title>Polarity Umpolung Strategy for the Radical Alkylation of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Free radical&#8208;mediated alkylation of general alkenes is a challenging and largely unmet goal. Herein, we disclose a conceptually novel &#8220;polarity umpolung&#8221; strategy for radical alkylation of alkenes using a portfolio of easily&#8208;accessed, dual&#8208;function alkylating reagents. This is achieved by substituting inherently nucleophilic alkyl radicals with electrophilic sulfone&#8208;decorated surrogates, thus inverting the usual mode of reactivity. Along with alkylation, an extra heteroaryl or oximino group is concurrently incorporated into alkenes via consecutive docking and migration process, leading to valuable products. The reaction displays a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.</dc:description>

      <title>An &#951;3&#8208;Bound Allyl Ligand on Magnesium in a Mechanochemically Generated Mg/K Allyl Complex</title>

When recrystallized from hexanes, the unsolvated  1  forms a 2D coordination polymer, in which the Mg is surrounded by three allyl ligands. Two of them are &#951;&#185;&#8208;bonded (Mg&#8211;C = 2.206(3) and 2.235(4) &#197;) and also &#960;&#8208;coordinated to K  +  cations. The third allyl is terminal and &#951;&#179;&#8208;bonded (Mg&#8211;C = 2.375(4)&#8211;2.446(4) &#197;; the C&#8211;C bond lengths differ by only 0.028 &#197;, indicating virtually complete electron delocalization. This is an unprecedented coordination mode for an allyl ligand bound to Mg. Density functional theory calculations indicate that in isolation, an &#951;&#179;&#8208;allyl configuration on Mg is energetically preferred over the corresponding &#951;  1  &#8208; (&#963;&#8208;bonded) arrangement, but the Mg must be in a low coordination environment for it to be experimentally realized.

      <title>A Facile and Versatile Synthesis of End&#8208;Functionalized Poly(phenylacetylene)s: A Multicomponent Catalytic System for Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes</title>
      <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system for well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of phenylacetylenes has been developed. The catalytic system is composed of easily available and bench&#8208;stable [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, aryl boronic acid derivatives, diphenylacetylene, 50% aq KOH, and PPh3. This system offers a method for facile and versatile synthesis of various end&#8208;functionalized  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s because components from aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylene were introduced to the initiating end of the polymers. The polymerization reaction shows a typical living nature with a high initiation efficiency, and the molecular weight of the resulting poly(phenylacetylene)s can be easily controlled with very narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn  = 1.02&#8211;1.09). The experimental facts suggest that the present catalytic system has the higher polymerization activity than the polymerization activities of other rhodium&#8208;based catalytic systems previously reported.</dc:description>

The catalytic system is composed of easily available and bench&#8208;stable [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, aryl boronic acid derivatives, diphenylacetylene, 50% aq KOH, and PPh3. This system offers a method for facile and versatile synthesis of various end&#8208;functionalized  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s because components from aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylene were introduced to the initiating end of the polymers. The polymerization reaction shows a typical living nature with a high initiation efficiency, and the molecular weight of the resulting poly(phenylacetylene)s can be easily controlled with very narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn  = 1.02&#8211;1.09). The experimental facts suggest that the present catalytic system has the higher polymerization activity than the polymerization activities of other rhodium&#8208;based catalytic systems previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Concise, Single&#8208;step Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;enriched Graphene: Immobilization of Molecular Clusters and Battery Applications</title>
      <dc:description>We achieved concise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;enriched graphene for battery applications. The direct treatment of graphene oxide (GO) with commercially available Lawesson&#8217;s reagent produced sulfur&#8208;enriched&#8208;reduced GO (S&#8208;rGO). Various techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirmed the occurrence of both sulfur functionalization and GO reduction. We also fabricated a nanohybrid material by using S&#8208;rGO with polyoxometalate (POM) as a cathode&#8208;active material for a rechargeable battery. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that POM clusters were individually immobilized on the S&#8208;rGO surface. This battery based on a POM/S&#8208;rGO complex exhibited greater cycling stability for the charge&#8211;discharge process than a battery with nanohybrid materials positioned between the POM and non&#8208;enriched rGO. Our results demonstrate that the use of sulfur&#8208;containing groups on a graphene surface can be extended to applications such as the catalysis of electrochemical reactions and electrodes in other battery systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Bidentate chiral bis(imidazolium)&#8208;based halogen bond donors: synthesis and first applications in enantioselective recognition and catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Even though halogen bonding &#8211; the noncovalent interaction between electrophilic halogen substituents and Lewis bases &#8211; has now been established in molecular recognition and catalysis, its use in enantioselective processes is still very little explored. Herein, we present the synthesis of chiral bidentate halogen bond donors based on two iodoimidazolium units with rigidly attached chiral sidearms. With these Lewis acids, chiral recognition of a racemic diamine is achieved in NMR studies. DFT calculations support a 1:1 interaction of the halogen bond donor with both enantiomers and indicate that the chiral recognition is based on a different spatial orientation of the Lewis bases in the halogen bonded complexes. In addition, moderate enantioselectivity is achieved in a Mukaiyama aldol reaction with a preorganized variant of the chiral halogen bond donor. This represents the first case in which asymmetric induction was realized with a pure halogen bond donor lacking any additionally active functional groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams from Acrylamides and Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of unprotected &#948;&#8208;lactams has been realized starting from readily accessible acrylamides and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides an efficient means of synthesizing a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines.







Abstract
We report a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available acrylamide derivatives and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides a rapid route to a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines. The regioselectivity of the reaction with unactivated terminal alkene is significantly improved by using Cpt ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The synthetic utility of the reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of a potential drug candidate containing a trisubstituted piperidine moiety. Mechanistic studies show that the reversibility of the C&#8722;H activation depends on the choice of Cp ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The irreversible C&#8722;H activation is observed and becomes turnover&#8208;limiting with [CptRhCl2]2 as catalyst.

      <title>An Unexpected Transannular [4+2] Cycloaddition during the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Norcembrene&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
They may look alike&#8230; During studies toward the total synthesis of the norditerpene natural product norcembrene&#8197;5, one diastereomer of a key intermediate (&#945;&#8208;OAc at C13) underwent clean and spontaneous Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition at room temperature (see scheme). However, the corresponding &#946;&#8197;isomer did not undergo a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but was oxidized to the corresponding furanone, which was further transformed into norcembrene&#8197;5.







Abstract
We report a concise and versatile total synthesis of the diterpenoid (+)&#8208;norcembrene&#8197;5 from simple building blocks. Ring&#8208;closing metathesis and an auxiliary&#8208;directed 1,4&#8208;addition are the key steps of our synthetic route. During the synthesis, an unprecedented, highly oxidized pentacyclic structural motif was established from a furanocembranoid through transannular [4+2] cycloaddition.

      <title>A Supramolecular Stabilizer of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction with a Synergistic Mode of Action</title>
      <dc:description>
A stabilizer of the interaction between the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), a driver in the majority of breast cancers, and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;, a negative regulator of ER&#945;, is developed as anti&#8208;cancer strategy. The stabilizer of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms and stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A.







Abstract
We report on a stabilizer of the interaction between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; and the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;). ER&#945; is a driver in the majority of breast cancers and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins are negative regulators of this nuclear receptor, making the stabilization of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) an interesting strategy. The stabilizer (1) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms containing an arginine mimetic, previously described as the GCP motif. 1 stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A and was thus hypothesized to bind to a different site. This is supported by computational analysis of 1 binding to the binary complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived phosphopeptide. Furthermore, 1 shows selectivity towards 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction over other 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client&#8208;derived phosphomotifs. These data provide a solid support of a new binding mode for a supramolecular 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; PPI stabilizer.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition A Supramolecular Stabilizer of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction with a Synergistic Mode of Action"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A stabilizer&lt;/b&gt; of the interaction between the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), a driver in the majority of breast cancers, and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;, a negative regulator of ER&#945;, is developed as anti&#8208;cancer strategy. The stabilizer of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms and stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on a stabilizer of the interaction between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; and the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;). ER&#945; is a driver in the majority of breast cancers and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins are negative regulators of this nuclear receptor, making the stabilization of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) an interesting strategy. The stabilizer (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms containing an arginine mimetic, previously described as the GCP motif. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A and was thus hypothesized to bind to a different site. This is supported by computational analysis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; binding to the binary complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived phosphopeptide. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows selectivity towards 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction over other 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client&#8208;derived phosphomotifs. These data provide a solid support of a new binding mode for a supramolecular 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; PPI stabilizer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>The emergence of structural DNA nanotechnology has enabled us to design the &#173;self&#8208;assembly of nanostructures and nanomachines with nanoscale precision. Recently, DNA brick strategy has provided a highly modular and scalable approach for the construction of complex structures, which can be used as nanoscale pegboards for the precise organization of molecules and nanoparticles for many applications.

      <title>Activation of Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalysts by Loading with Ultrafine Rh&#8722;Cr Mixed&#8208;Oxide Cocatalyst Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>The activity of many water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts could be improved by the use of Rh(III)&#8211;Cr(III) mixed oxide (Rh  2&#8722;  x  Cr  x  O  3  ) particles as cocatalysts. Although further improvement of water&#8208;splitting activity could be achieved if the size of the Rh  2&#8722;  x  Cr  x  O  3  particles was decreased further, it is difficult to load ultrafine (&lt;2 nm) Rh  2&#8722;  x  Cr  x  O  3  particles onto a photocatalyst using conventional loading methods. In this study, we successfully established a new loading method and used it to load Rh  2&#8722;  x  Cr  x  O  3  particles with a size of approximately 1.3 nm and a narrow size distribution onto the BaLa  4  Ti  4  O  15  photocatalyst. The obtained photocatalyst exhibited an apparent quantum yield of 16%, which is the highest achieved for BaLa  4  Ti  4  O  15  to date. Thus, the developed loading technique of Rh  2&#8722;  x  Cr  x  O  3  particles is extremely effective at improving the activity of the water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst BaLa  4  Ti  4  O  15  . This method is expected to be extended to other advanced water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts to achieve higher quantum yields.</dc:description>

      <title>Biosynthetically Inspiring Synthesis of Secu&#8217;amamine A, Fluvirosaones A and B</title>
      <dc:description>We present a concise synthesis of secu&#8217;amamine A, fluvirosaones A and B from readily available allosecurinine and viroallosecurinine. The key C2&#8208;enamine derivative of (viro)allosecurinine, the presumed biosynthetic precursors of these natural products, was accessed, for the first time, by a VO(acac)  2  &#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction. Formal hydration and 1,2&#8208;amine shift of this pluripotent enamine compound afforded secu&#8217;amamine A. On the other hand, formal oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between this enamine and TMS&#8208;substituted methallyl iodide reagent paved the way to the assumed biosynthetic precursors of fluvirosaones A and B. We demonstrated that the relative stereochemistry at the C2 position of these advanced intermediates governs the fate of 1,2&#8208;amine shift leading to fluvirosaones A and B, respectively. While our synthetic design was inspired by the biosynthetic hypothesis of these natural products, syntheses of potential biosynthetic precursors and investigations of their chemical reactivity inversely have provided insights regarding the biogenesis of these natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Active Superbulky Alkaline Earth Metal Amide Catalysts for Hydrogenation of Challenging Alkenes and Aromatic Rings</title>
      <dc:description>Two series of bulky alkaline earth (Ae) metal amide complexes have been prepared: Ae[N(TRIP)2]2 (1&#8208;Ae) and Ae[N(TRIP)(DIPP)]2 (2&#8208;Ae) (Ae = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, TRIP = SiiPr3, DIPP = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). While monomeric 1&#8208;Ca was already known, the new complexes have been structurally characterized. Monomers 1&#8208;Ae are highly linear while the monomers 2&#8208;Ae are slightly bent. The bulkier amide complexes 1&#8208;Ae are by far the most active catalysts in alkene hydrogenation with activities increasing from Mg to Ba. Catalyst 1&#8208;Ba can reduce internal alkenes like cyclohexene or 3&#8208;hexene and highly challenging substrates like 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene or tetraphenylethylene. It is also active in arene hydrogenation reducing anthracene and naphthalene (even when substituted with an alkyl) as well as biphenyl. Benzene could be reduced to cyclohexane but full conversion was not reached. The first step in catalytic hydrogenation is formation of an (amide)AeH species which can form larger aggregates. Increasing the bulk of the amide ligand decreases aggregate size but it is unclear what the true catalyst(s) is (are). DFT calculations suggest that amide bulk also has a noticeable influence on the thermodynamics for formation of the (amide)AeH species. Complex 1&#8208;Ba is currently the most powerful Ae metal hydrogenation catalyst. Due to tremendously increased activities in comparison to those of previously reported catalysts, the substrate scope in hydrogenation catalysis could be extended to challenging multi&#8208;substituted unactivated alkenes and even to arenes among which benzene.</dc:description>

      <title>Mining Symbionts of Spider&#8208;Transmitted Fungus Illuminates Uncharted Biosynthetic Pathways to Cytotoxic Benzolactones</title>
      <dc:description>A spider&#8208;transmitted fungus (  Rhizopus microsporus  ) that was isolated from necrotic human tissue was found to harbor endofungal bacteria (  Burkholderia  sp.). Metabolic profiling of the symbionts revealed a complex of cytotoxic agents (necroximes). Their structures were fully characterized as oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides equipped with a peptidic side chain. Necroximes are potent cytotoxic agents that are also formed in symbiosis with the fungal host and could have contributed to the necrosis. Genome sequencing and in silico analyses revealed a novel modular PKS/NRPS assembly line equipped with several non&#8208;canonical domains. Based on gene deletion mutants, we propose the first biosynthetic model for bacterial benzolactones. We identified specific traits that serve as genetic handles to identify related salicylate macrolide pathways in various other bacterial genera (lobatamide, oximidine, apicularen and cruentaren). Our work sets an unusual example of hypothesis&#8208;based drug discovery in the context of human disease.

      <title>Genome mining of oxidation modules in trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases reveals a culturable source for lobatamides</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial&#160;  trans  &#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (  trans  &#8208;AT PKSs) are multimodular megaenzymes that biosynthesize many bioactive natural products. They contain a remarkable range of domains and module types that introduce different substituents into growing polyketide chains.

In this work, genome mining focusing on architecturally diverse oxidation modules in&#160;  trans  &#8208;AT PKSs led us to the culturable plant symbiont&#160;  Gynuella sunshinyii  &#160;that harbors two distinct modules in one orphan PKS. The PKS product was revealed to be lobatamide A, a potent cytotoxin previously only known from a marine tunicate. Biochemical studies show that one module generates glycolyl thioester intermediates, while the other is proposed to be involved in oxime formation. The data suggest varied roles of oxygenation modules in the biosynthesis of polyketide scaffolds and support the importance of&#160;  trans  &#8208;AT PKSs in the specialized metabolism of symbiotic bacteria.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Boronate Ester Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Large Single Crystalline Domains for Neuromorphic Memory Device</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of crystalline boronate ester covalent organic frameworks (BECOFs) in powder and thin&#8208;film through solvothermal method and on&#8208;solid&#8208;surface synthesis, respectively, their applications in electronics, remain less explored due to the challenges in thin&#8208;film processability and device integration associated with the control of film thickness, layer orientation, stability and crystallinity. Moreover, although the crystalline domain sizes of the powder samples can reach micrometer scale (up to ~1.5 &#181;m), the reported thin&#8208;film samples have so far rather small crystalline domains up to 100 nm. Here we demonstrate an&#160;efficient synthesis of crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BECOF films composed of porphyrin macrocycles and phenyl or naphthyl linkers (named as  2D BECOF&#8208;PP  or  2D BECOF&#8208;PN  ) by employing a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) on the water surface. The achieved 2D BECOF&#8208;PP is featured as free&#8208;standing thin film with large single&#8208;crystalline domains up to ~60 &#181;m  2  and tunable thickness from 6 to 16 nm. The molecular&#8208;level structures are clearly resolved by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;TEM) and selected&#8208;area electron diffraction (SAED) which are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Due to the high crystallinity, facile thin&#8208;film processability, high mechanical stability as well as the incorporation of electroactive porphyrin monomers, a hybrid memory device composed of 2D BECOF&#8208;PP film on silicon nanowire&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor is demonstrated as a bio&#8208;inspired system to mimic neuronal synapses, displaying a learning&#8208;erasing&#8208;forgetting memory process. Pulsed voltage input induces the polarization of the film that is critical to emulate the potentiation of the neuronal membrane. This work paves the way to develop highly crystalline 2D COF thin film as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate active component applicable for CMOS&#8208;compatible neuromorphic computing.</dc:description>

      <title>Redox Stability Controls the Cellular Uptake and Activity of Ruthenium&#8208;Based Inhibitors of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU)</title>
      <dc:description>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is the ion channel that mediates Ca  2+  uptake in the mitochondria. Inhibitors of the MCU are valuable as potential therapeutic agents and tools to study mitochondrial Ca  2+  . The best&#8208;known inhibitor of the MCU is the ruthenium compound Ru360. Although this compound is effective in permeabilized cells, it does not work in intact biological systems. We have recently reported the synthesis and characterization of Ru265, a complex that selectively inhibits the MCU in intact cells. Here, the physical and biological properties of Ru265 and Ru360 are described in detail. Using atomic absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging, we show that only Ru265 is transported by organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3). As an explanation for the poor cell uptake of Ru360, we show that Ru360 is deactivated by biological reductants. These data highlight how structural modifications in metal complexes can have profound effects on their biological activities.</dc:description>

      <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Approach for the Detection of Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 in Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing of COX&#8208;2: An isoform&#8208;selective fluorogenic probe reports on enzymatic activity within live cells. A two&#8208;step activation facilitates the release of the natural product and resorufin for confocal imaging and flow cytometry. CoxFluor indicates that COX&#8208;2 activity can be regulated by oxygen without a change in the protein expression level.







Abstract
Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) overexpression is prominent in inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Directly monitoring COX&#8208;2 activity within its native environment poses an exciting approach to account for and illuminate the effect of the local environments on protein activity. Herein, we report the development of CoxFluor, the first activity&#8208;based sensing approach for monitoring COX&#8208;2 within live cells with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. CoxFluor strategically links a natural substrate with a dye precursor to engage both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of COX&#8208;2. This catalyzes the release of resorufin and the natural product, as supported by molecular dynamics and ensemble docking. CoxFluor enabled the detection of oxygen&#8208;dependent changes in COX&#8208;2 activity that are independent of protein expression within live macrophage cells.

      <title>Structure Selectivity of Alkaline Periodate Oxidation on Lignocellulose for Facile Isolation of Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure based: A novel method based on a recyclable and newly selective alkaline periodate oxidation at pH&#8197;10 provides a sustainable strategy for the efficient isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from various lignocellulosic materials. Isolation of the CNCs results from the structural differences between the ordered and non&#8208;ordered regions of the lignocellulose.







Abstract
Reported here for the first time is the alkaline periodate oxidation of lignocelluloses for the selective isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). With the high concentrations as a potassium salt at pH&#8197;10, periodate ions predominantly exist as dimeric orthoperiodate ions (H2I2O104&#8722;). With reduced oxidizing activity in alkaline solutions, dimeric orthoperiodate ions preferentially oxidized non&#8208;ordered cellulose regions. The alkaline surroundings promoted the degradation of these oxidized cellulose chains by &#946;&#8208;alkoxy fragmentation and generated CNCs. The obtained CNCs were uniform in size and generally contained carboxy groups. Furthermore, the reaction solution could be reused after regeneration of the periodate with ozone gas. This method allows direct production of CNCs from diverse sources, in particular lignocellulosic raw materials including sawdust (European beech and Scots pine), flax, and kenaf, in addition to microcrystalline cellulose and pulp.

      <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective cobalt and nickel single&#8208;atom catalysts were developed and applied as electrocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction. In their Communication on page&#8197;3033, S. Kattel, L. Song, J.&#8197;G. Chen et&#8197;al. show that these single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit high activity in the direct production of synthesis gas. Furthermore, controllable ratios of synthesis gas (CO/H2) were achieved by altering the metal ratios, while maintaining the overall activity.

      <title>Polymer Nanocontainers for Intracellular Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Special delivery: Carrier systems for intracellular delivery are required to overcome limitations of therapeutic agents. Nanocontainers comprised of an aqueous core and a polymer shell offer the possibility of stimuli&#8208;responsive payload release and surface modification to enhance local selectivity. This Minireview considers the synthesis and properties of polymer nanocontainers for intracellular delivery.







Abstract
Carriers for intracellular delivery are required to overcome limitations of therapeutic agents such as low specificity, systemic toxicity, high clearance rate, and low therapeutic index. Nanocontainers comprised of an aqueous core and a polymer shell have received increasing attention because they readily combine stimuli response to improve intracellular payload release and surface modification to enhance selectivity towards the desired region of action. This Minireview summarizes the design and properties of polymer nanocontainers for intracellular delivery, classified according to the polymer architecture.

      <title>Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Performance enhancers: Electrolytes for Li&#8211;air batteries include non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, and hybrid electrolytes. This Review shows the importance of electrolytes to the mechanisms and performance of lithium&#8211;air batteries and provides a basis for selecting suitable electrolytes. The existing challenges, solutions, as well as guidance for the future direction of this field are also considered.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;air batteries are promising devices for electrochemical energy storage because of their ultrahigh energy density. However, it is still challenging to achieve practical Li&#8211;air batteries because of their severe capacity fading and poor rate capability. Electrolytes are the prime suspects for cell failure. In this Review, we focus on the opportunities and challenges of electrolytes for rechargeable Li&#8211;air batteries. A detailed summary of the reaction mechanisms, internal compositions, instability factors, selection criteria, and design ideas of the considered electrolytes is provided to obtain appropriate strategies to meet the battery requirements. In particular, ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes and solid&#8208;state electrolytes show exciting opportunities to control both the high energy density and safety.

      <title>Synthetic Applications of Oxidative Aromatic Coupling&#8212;From Biphenols to Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Coupling up: The dehydrogenative coupling of arenes is an ultimate example of C&#8722;H activation. This Review highlights the most exciting examples of the Scholl reaction, ranging from the synthesis of biphenols through natural products to nanographenes and on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation reported since 2013.







Abstract
Oxidative aromatic coupling occupies a fundamental place in the modern chemistry of aromatic compounds. It is a method of choice for the assembly of large and bewildering architectures. Considerable effort was also devoted to applications of the Scholl reaction for the synthesis of chiral biphenols and natural products. The ability to form biaryl linkages without any prefunctionalization provides an efficient pathway to many complex structures. Although the chemistry of this process is only now becoming fully understood, this reaction continues to both fascinate and challenge researchers. This is especially true for heterocoupling, that is, oxidative aromatic coupling with the chemoselective formation of a C&#8722;C bond between two different arenes. Analysis of the progress achieved in this field since 2013 reveals that many groups have contributed by pushing the boundary of structural possibilities, expanding into surface&#8208;assisted (cyclo)dehydrogenation, and developing new reagents.

      <title>Amperometric Measurements and Dynamic Models Reveal a Mechanism for How Zinc Alters Neurotransmitter Release</title>
      <dc:description>
From dense core to halo: Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using TEM was combined with monitoring and modelling single&#8208;cell amperometric responses to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to explain the regulation mechanism of synaptic plasticity by Zn2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.







Abstract
Zinc, a suspected potentiator of learning and memory, is shown to affect exocytotic release and storage in neurotransmitter&#8208;containing vesicles. Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using transmission electron microscopy was combined with single&#8208;cell amperometry to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to compare these changes to theoretical predictions based on the concept of partial release as opposed to full quantal release. This powerful combined analytical approach establishes the existence of an unsuspected strong link between vesicle structure and exocytotic dynamics, which can be used to explain the mechanism of regulation of synaptic plasticity by Zn2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.

      <title>Styrene Hydroformylation with In situ H: Regioselectivity Control by Coupling with Low&#8208;temperature Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Hydroformylation of olefins is one of the most important homogeneously catalyzed industrial reactions for aldehyde synthesis. Various ligands are usually used to obtain desired linear aldehydes in aliphatic olefin hydroformylation. However, in aromatic hydroformylation it prefers to obtain branched aldehydes with common ligands, posing a grand challenge for the synthesis of linear products. In this work a novel approach to selectively obtain linear aldehydes in hydroformylation of styrene and its derivatives was realized by coupling with a water&#8208;gas shift reaction on Rh single&#8208;atom catalyst without using ligands. Detailed studies revealed that the in situ H generated from the water&#8208;gas shift plays a critical role in determining the high regioselectivity to linear products. The coupling of a traditionally homogeneous catalysis process with a heterogeneous catalysis reaction to tune product selectivity may provide a new avenue for the heterogenization of homogenous catalysis process.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible Anionic Redox Activities in Conventional LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>The redox reaction of oxygen has been considered critical in controlling the electrochemical properties of Li&#8208;excessive layered oxide electrodes. However, conventional electrode materials without over&#8208;lithiation remain the most practical if their performance could be improved through rational approaches. Typically, cationic redox reactions are believed to dominate the electrochemical operations in conventional electrodes, and the involvement of anionic redox reactions, although proposed, is yet to be clarified through reliable characterizations. Here, we show unambiguous evidence of reversible anionic redox reactions in LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2., with a detailed quantification on its reversibility upon electrochemical cycling. Two types of oxygen involvements are discussed. One is the typical involvement of O through hybridization with transition metals throughout the electrochemical operation; the other is the intrinsic O redox at high potentials, which is 75% reversible during initial cycling and 63% retained after 10 cycles. Our results clarify the reaction mechanism at high potentials in conventional layered electrodes involving both cationic and anionic reactions. Additionally, our combined characterizations indicate a critical role of transition&#8208;metals for oxygen redox activities and the optimism of utilizing reversible oxygen redox reactions in conventional layered oxides for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

Additionally, our combined characterizations indicate a critical role of transition&#8208;metals for oxygen redox activities and the optimism of utilizing reversible oxygen redox reactions in conventional layered oxides for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Coupling of Solar Energy and Thermal Energy for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Status and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
A bundle of energy: The coupling of solar energy and thermal energy is a promising strategy to mediate the activity and/or selectivity of CO2 reduction. The status and prospects of this topic are reviewed, with the aim of providing guidelines for the design of new catalysts.







Abstract
Enormous efforts have been devoted to the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) by utilizing various driving forces, such as heat, electricity, and radiation. However, the efficient reduction of CO2 is still challenging because of sluggish kinetics. Recent pioneering studies from several groups, including us, have demonstrated that the coupling of solar energy and thermal energy offers a novel and promising strategy to promote the activity and/or manipulate selectivity in CO2 reduction. Herein, we clarify the definition and principles of coupling solar energy and thermal energy, and comprehensively review the status and prospects of CO2 reduction by coupling solar energy and thermal energy. Catalyst design, reactor configuration, photo&#8208;mediated activity/selectivity, and mechanism studies in photo&#8208;thermo CO2 reduction will be emphasized. The aim of this Review is to promote understanding towards CO2 activation and provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts for the efficient reduction of CO2.

      <title>Deracemization Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited deracemization: Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been utilized to convert racemates into single enantiomers in the presence of a chiral photosensitizer or a pair of chiral catalysts. Mechanistic studies revealed that energy transfer (EnT) or a sequence of electron transfer (ET), proton transfer (PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is operative.







Abstract
Deracemization is an ideal but challenging strategy for the conversion of a racemic mixture into a single enantiomer. Recent studies have demonstrated that visible&#8208;light photocatalysis could be utilized to promote selective deracemization of axially chiral allenes as well as cyclopropylquinolones and cyclic ureas with central chirality either through energy transfer or through a sequence of electron, proton, and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

      <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanotheranostic System for Precise Diagnosis and Treatment of Peritoneal Metastasis</title>
      <dc:description>Activatable theranostic systems display potential for improved tumor diagnosis and therapy owing to high detection specificities, effective ablation, and minimal side&#8208;effects. Herein, a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostic system (FEAD1) for precise diagnosis and treatment of peritoneal metastases is presented. FEAD1 was fabricated by self&#8208;assembling the peptide Fmoc&#8208;His, mercaptopropionic&#8208;functionalized Ag  2  S quantum dots (MPA&#8208;Ag  2  S QDs), the chemodrug doxorubicin (DOX), and NIR absorber A1094 into nanoparticles. We show that in healthy tissue, FEAD1 exists in an NIR&#8208;II fluorescence &#8220;off&#8221; state, because of Ag  2  S QDs&#8211;A1094 interactions, while DOX remains in stealth mode. Upon delivery of FEAD1 to the tumor, the acidic TME triggers its disassembly through breakage of the Fmoc&#8208;His metal coordination and DOX hydrophobic interactions. Release of A1094 switches on Ag  2  S fluorescence, illuminating the tumor, accompanied by burst release of DOX within the tumor tissue, thereby achieving precise tumor theranostics. This TME&#8208;activated theranostic strategy holds great promise for future clinical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Substitution in BiO2&#8722;x for Efficient Molecular&#8208;Oxygen Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual defects: Introducing dual defects (surface oxygen vacancies and bulk oxygen substitution) in cubic BiO2&#8722;x was found to lead to a spatial and electronic synergistic process in photocatalytic molecular O2 activation. Oxygen substitution can induce a local electric field to promote bulk separation of electrons and holes, and oxygen vacancies serve as capture centers for electrons to facilitate the adsorption and activation of O2 (see picture).







Abstract
Defects in nanomaterials often lead to properties that are absent in their pristine counterparts. To date, most studies have focused on the effect of single defects, while ignoring the synergy of multiple defects. In this study, a model of photocatalytic O2 activation was selected to unravel the role of dual defects by decorating bismuth oxide with surface O vacancies and bulk O substitution simultaneously. The introduction of dual defects led to a spatial and electronic synergistic process: i)&#8197;O substitution induced a local electric field in the bulk of BiO2&#8722;x, which promoted bulk separation of electrons and holes immediately after their generation; ii)&#8197;O vacancies efficiently lowered the conduction band, served as the capture center for electrons, and thus facilitated the adsorption and activation of O2. This effect was greatly promoted by the coexistence of bulk O substitution, and DFT calculations showed that only O substitution near an O vacancy could have this effect.

      <title>A Convergent Total Synthesis of the Death Cap Toxin &#945;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A new route to the toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is presented. The key steps of the convergent [5+1+2]&#8208;synthesis are the preformation of the thioether building block and access to the enantiomerically pure non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on a multigram scale. The peptide fragment based methodology is the first convergent &#945;&#8208;amanitin synthesis fully performed in solution phase.







Abstract
The toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is mostly found in different species of the mushroom genus Amanita, with the death cap (Amanita phalloides) as one of the most prominent members. Due to its high selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II, which is directly linked to its high toxicity, particularly to hepatocytes, &#945;&#8208;amanitin received an increased attention as a toxin&#8208;component of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADC) in cancer research. Furthermore, the isolation of &#945;&#8208;amanitin from mushrooms as the sole source severely restricts compound supply as well as further investigations, as structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Based on a straightforward access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid dihydroxyisoleucine, we herein present a robust total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amanitin providing options for production at larger scale as well as future structural diversifications.
