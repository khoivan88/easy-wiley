      <title>Iridium Catalysed C&#8208;H Borylation of Heteroarenes: Balancing steric and electronic regiocontrol</title>
      <dc:description>Over the past twenty years, the iridium catalysed borylation of aromatic C&#8208;H bonds has become the method for the synthesis of aromatic organoboron compounds required for many purposes including applications in natural product synthesis, material science, and medicinal chemistry. The reaction is highly efficient, tolerant of a broad range of substituents and can be applied to both carbocyclic and heterocyclic substrates. The regioselectivity of C&#8208;H activation is dominated by steric considerations and there have been considerable efforts in recent years to develop more selective processes for less constrained substrates. However, most of these have focused on benzenoid type substrates and in contrast, heteroarenes remain much desired but more challenging substrates with the position and / or nature of the heteroatom(s) significantly affecting reactivity and regioselectivity. This review will survey the borylation of heteroarenes focusing on the influence of steric and electronic effects on regiochemical outcome and, by linking to current mechanistic understandings, aims to provide insights to what is currently possible and where further developments are required.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamical Bonding Driving Mixed Valency in a Metal Boride</title>
      <dc:description>Samarium hexaboride is an anomaly, having many exotic and seemingly mutually incompatible properties.

The mixed valency arises in SmB 6&#160; from thermal population of these distinct minima enabled by motion of B.

      <title>Micro&#8208;scale device &#8208; an alternative route for studying the intrinsic properties of solid&#8208;state materials: case of semiconducting TaGeIr</title>

      <title>Constructing a supersaturated electrolyte front surface for stable rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (RAZB) have been re&#8208;evaluated because of the superiority in addressing safety and cost concerns. Nonetheless, the limited lifespan arising from dendritic electrodeposit of metallic Zn critically harassed their further development. Herein, metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was constructed as front surface layer to maintain a supersaturated electrolyte layer on Zn anode. Raman spectroscopy indicated that the highly&#8208;coordinated ion complexes migrating through MOF channels were different from the solvation structure in bulk electrolyte. Benefited from the unique supersaturated front surface, symmetric Zn cells survived up to 3000 hours at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  , near 55 times of bare Zn anodes. The electrodeposit of Zn turned into round&#8208;edged and dense&#8208;packed mode with less side&#8208;product accumulating. Moreover, aqueous MnO  2  &#8208;Zn batteries delivered reversible capacity of 180.3 mAh g  &#8208;1  and high capacity retention of 88.9% after 600 cycles with MnO  2  mass loading up to 4.2 mg cm  &#8208;2  .

      <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Study of a Plasmon&#8208;Induced Reaction for a Strongly Chemisorbed Molecule</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reactions induced by plasmons achieve effective solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, the mechanism of the reactions induced by the plasmons, which generate a strong electric field, hot carriers and heat through the excitation and decay processes, is still controversial. In addition, what factor governs the mechanism is not fully understood. To obtain mechanistic knowledge, we investigated the plasmon&#8208;induced dissociation of a single&#8208;molecule strongly chemisorbed on a metal surface, two O  2  species chemisorbed on Ag(110) with different orientations and electronic structures, using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) combined with light irradiation at 5 K. A combination of quantitative analysis by the STM and density functional theory calculations revealed that the hot carriers are transferred to the antibonding (&#960;*) orbitals of O  2  strongly hybridized with the metal states and that the dominant pathway and reaction yield are determined by the electronic structures formed by the molecule&#8211;metal chemical interaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantiodifferentiating Photodimerization of a 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Anthracene Assisted by Supramolecular Double&#8208;Helix Formation with Chiral Amines</title>
      <dc:description>A novel 2,6&#8208;anthrylene&#8208;linked bis(m&#8208;terphenylcarboxylic acid) strand (  1  ) self&#8208;associates into a racemic double&#8208;helix. In the presence of chiral mono&#8208; and diamines, either a right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed double&#8208;helix was predominantly induced by chiral amines sandwiched between the carboxylic acid strands with accompanying stacking of the two prochiral anthracene linker units in an enantiotopic face&#8208;selective way, as revealed by circular dichroism and NMR spectral analyses. The photoirradiation of the optically active double helices complexed with chiral amines proceeded in a diastereo&#8208; (anti or syn) and enantiodifferentiating way to afford the chiral anti&#8208;photodimer with up to 98% enantiomeric excess when (R)&#8208;phenylethylamine was used as a chiral double&#8208;helix inducer. The resulting optically active anti&#8208; photodimer can recognize the chirality of amines and diastereoselectively complex with chiral amines.</dc:description>

      <title>Artificial Deprenylation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (i6A) RNA</title>
      <dc:description>N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (i6A) is an RNA modification as a component of cytokines, which regulate plant growth/differentiation, and a subset of tRNAs, where it improves the efficiency and accuracy of translation. Previously, the installation and removal of this modification was mediated by prenyltransferases and cytokinin oxidases. However, a chemical approach to selective deprenylation of i6A has not been developed. Herein a selected group of oxoammonium cations functioned as artificial deprenylases to promote highly selective deprenylation of i6A at nucleoside, oligonucleotide and live cells levels. Importantly, other epigenetic modifications, amino acid residues and natural products, were not affected. Moreover, a significant phenotype difference in the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot and root development with incubation of the cation was observed. Collectively, these results establish these small organic molecules as direct chemical regulators/artificial deprenylases of i6A and provide novel probes in RNA biology studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective electroenzymatic oxyfunctionalization by alkane monooxygenase in a biofuel cell</title>
      <dc:description>Aliphatic synthetic intermediates with high added value are generally produced from alkane sources (e.g., petroleum) by inert carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8208;H) bond activation using classical chemical methods (high temperature, rare metals). As an alternative approach for these reactions, alkane monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (alkB) is able to catalyze the difficult terminal oxyfunctionalization of alkanes selectively and under mild conditions. Here, we report an electrosynthetic system using an alkB biocathode which produces alcohols, epoxides, and sulfoxides through bioelectrochemical hydroxylation, epoxidation, sulfoxidation, and demethylation. The capacity of the alkB binding pocket to protect internal functional groups, a lucrative capability, is also demonstrated. By coupling our alkB biocathode with a hydrogenase bioanode and using H2 as a clean fuel source, we have developed and characterized a series of enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) capable of oxyfunctionalization while simultaneously producing electricity.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic Behavior of Mono&#8208;N&#8208;Protected Amino Acid Ligands in Ligand&#8208;Accelerated C&#8211;H Activation by Palladium(II)</title>
      <dc:description>Mono&#8208;  N  &#8208;protected amino acids (MPAAs) are increasingly common ligands in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization reactions. Previous studies have shown how these ligands accelerate catalytic turnover by facilitating the C&#8211;H activation step. Here, we show that MPAA ligands exhibit a second property commonly associated with "ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis": the ability to support catalytic turnover at substoichiometric ligand:metal ratios. This catalytic role of the MPAA ligand is characterized in stoichiometric C&#8211;H activation and catalytic C&#8211;H functionalization reactions. Palladacycle formation with substrates bearing carboxylate and pyridine directing groups exhibit a 50&#8211;100&#8208;fold increase in rate when only 0.05 equivalents of MPAA are present relative to Pd  II  . These and other mechanistic data indicate that facile exchange between MPAAs and anionic ligands coordinated to Pd  II  enables a single MPAA to support C&#8211;H activation at multiple Pd  II  centers.</dc:description>

      <title>Co&#8208;crystallization induced spontaneous deracemization: A general thermodynamic approach to deracemization.</title>
      <dc:description>Processes leading to enantiopure compounds are of utmost importance, in particular for the pharmaceutical industry. Starting from a racemic mixture, Crystallization Induced Diastereo&#8208;meric Transformation allows for a theoretical 100% transformation of the desired enantiomer. However, this method has the inherent limiting requirement for the organic compound to form a salt. In this contribution, this limitation is lifted by introducing co&#8208;crystallization in the context of thermodynamic deracemization, with the process applied to a model chiral fungicide. We here report a new general single thermodynamic deracemization process based on co&#8208;crystallization for the deracemization of (R,S)&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;Pentan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This work presents the feasibility of this novel approach and paves the way to further development of such processes.)</dc:description>

We here report a new general single thermodynamic deracemization process based on co&#8208;crystallization for the deracemization of (R,S)&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;Pentan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This work presents the feasibility of this novel approach and paves the way to further development of such processes.)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Growth of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Controlled Structure using Floating Carbide Solid Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Controlled synthesis of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is important for further application of carbon nanotubes. SWNT horizontal arrays with specific chirality can be enriched using carbide solid catalysts on substrates. However, it remains a big challenge to increase the production by continuous loading the carbide solid catalysts on substrates. Herein, we develop a rational approach to prepare floating carbide solid catalyst (FSC) for the controlled growth of SWNTs. Titanium carbide (TiC) nanoparticle FSC was directly obtained in the carrier gas phase by decomposition and carbonization of titanocene dichloride precursor at high&#8208;temperature. Using the TiC nanoparticles FSC, SWNTs horizontal arrays or randomly distributed networks were obtained depending on the collecting substrates. The chirality of the as&#8208;grown SWNTs were thermodynamically controlled to have four&#8208;fold symmetry, the same as (2 0 0) plane of face&#8208;centered cubic TiC.

      <title>Stable Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins (mNHOs)</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly charged: A new class of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins is described featuring a highly ylidic double bond. The compounds can be utilized as ligands in main&#8208;group and transition metal chemistry. Their donor properties exceed previously reported traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins.







Abstract
We report a new class of stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, featuring a highly polarized (strongly ylidic) double bond. The ground&#8208;state structure cannot be described through an uncharged mesomeric Lewis&#8208;structure, thereby structurally distinguishing them from traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs). mNHOs can easily be obtained through deprotonation of the corresponding methylated N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium and N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;imidazolium salts, respectively. In their reactivity, they represent strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligands as shown by their coordination complexes of rhodium and boron. Their calculated proton affinities, their experimentally derived basicities (competition experiments), as well as donor abilities (Tolman electronic parameter; TEP) exceed the so far reported class of NHOs.

      <title>Impact of Positional Isomerism on Pathway Complexity in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>
A matter of position: Rational placement of functional groups for weak interactions has been exploited as a new method for pathway control in aqueous self&#8208;assembly. The results may contribute to understanding the molecular design principles that govern the outcome of self&#8208;assembly processes in water.







Abstract
Pathway complexity has become an important topic in recent years due to its relevance in the optimization of molecular assembly processes, which typically require precise sample preparation protocols. Alternatively, competing aggregation pathways can be controlled by molecular design, which primarily rely on geometrical changes of the building blocks. However, understanding how to control pathway complexity by molecular design remains elusive and new approaches are needed. Herein, we exploit positional isomerism as a new molecular design strategy for pathway control in aqueous self&#8208;assembly. We compare the self&#8208;assembly of two carboxyl&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic BODIPY dyes that solely differ in the relative position of functional groups. Placement of the carboxyl group at the 2&#8208;position enables efficient pairwise H&#8208;bonding interactions into a single thermodynamic species, whereas meso&#8208;substitution induces pathway complexity due to competing hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Our results show the importance of positional engineering for pathway control in aqueous self&#8208;assembly.

      <title>Design of Complex Solid&#8208;Solution Electrocatalysts by Correlating Configuration, Adsorption Energy Distribution Patterns, and Activity Curves</title>
      <dc:description>
Elementary: The effect of changing elements within high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts with respect to changes in adsorption energies and the correlated characteristic activity curves is analyzed. This concept is verified for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. A targeted design of complex solid&#8208;solution electrocatalysts is significantly enhanced by only screening equiatomic alloys without the need to scan the whole composition range.







Abstract
Complex solid&#8208;solution electrocatalysts (also referred to as high&#8208;entropy alloy) are gaining increasing interest owing to their promising properties which were only recently discovered. With the capability of forming complex single&#8208;phase solid solutions from five or more constituents, they offer unique capabilities of fine&#8208;tuning adsorption energies. However, the elemental complexity within the crystal structure and its effect on electrocatalytic properties is poorly understood. We discuss how addition or replacement of elements affect the adsorption energy distribution pattern and how this impacts the shape and activity of catalytic response curves. We highlight the implications of these conceptual findings on improved screening of new catalyst configurations and illustrate this strategy based on the discovery and experimental evaluation of several highly active complex solid solution nanoparticle catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media.

      <title>Fast Lithium Ion Conduction in Lithium Phosphidoaluminates</title>
      <dc:description>
Lightweight and with fast lithium ion conduction: Solid electrolytes with a fast ion conduction are crucial for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The new material Li9AlP4 combines a high lithium content and a high ionic mobility of 3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with a very low theoretical density of 1.703&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte materials are crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSB) using a nonflammable electrolyte. In order to retain a low lithium&#8208;ion transfer resistance, fast lithium ion conducting solid electrolytes are required. We report on the novel superionic conductor Li9AlP4 which is easily synthesised from the elements via ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing at moderate temperatures and which is characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. This representative of the novel compound class of lithium phosphidoaluminates has, as an undoped material, a remarkable fast ionic conductivity of 3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 29&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as determined by impedance spectroscopy. Temperature&#8208;dependent 7Li NMR spectroscopy supports the fast lithium motion. In addition, Li9AlP4 combines a very high lithium content with a very low theoretical density of 1.703&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The distribution of the Li atoms over the diverse crystallographic positions between the [AlP4]9&#8722; tetrahedra is analyzed by means of DFT calculations.

Temperature&#8208;dependent &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li NMR spectroscopy supports the fast lithium motion. In addition, Li&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;AlP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; combines a very high lithium content with a very low theoretical density of 1.703&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The distribution of the Li atoms over the diverse crystallographic positions between the [AlP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;9&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra is analyzed by means of DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allosteric Recognition of Homomeric and Heteromeric Pairs of Monosaccharides by a Foldamer Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>
Two monosacharides fit in an aromatic double helical foldamer container. Binding is shown to be selective in terms of the sugar anomer, pyranose/furanose tautomer, and helix handedness, and leads to well defined homomeric or heteromeric complexes. One heteromeric complex selectively forms out of 42 different possibilities.







Abstract
The recognition of either homomeric or heteromeric pairs of pentoses in an aromatic oligoamide double helical foldamer capsule was evidenced by circular dichroism (CD), NMR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cavity of the host was predicted to be large enough to accommodate simultaneously two xylose molecules and to form a 1:2 complex (one container, two saccharides). Solution and solid&#8208;state data revealed the selective recognition of the &#945;&#8208;4C1&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranose tautomer, which is bound at two identical sites in the foldamer cavity. A step further was achieved by sequestering a heteromeric pair of pentoses, that is, one molecule of &#945;&#8208;4C1&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranose and one molecule of &#946;&#8208;1C4&#8208;d&#8208;arabinopyranose despite the symmetrical nature of the host and despite the similarity of the guests. Subtle induced&#8208;fit and allosteric effects are responsible for the outstanding selectivities observed.

      <title>An Air&#8208;Stable Heterobimetallic Si2M2 Tetrahedral Cluster</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterobimetallic tetrahedrane&#8208;type clusters with a Si2M2 (M=Mo, W) core were isolated as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable solids from the corresponding NHC&#8208;stabilized metal silylidene complexes upon abstraction of the NHC. The formation of these clusters by dimerization of intermediate metal silylidyne (M&#8801;Si) complexes was supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable heterobimetallic tetrahedral clusters [Cp(CO)2MSiR]2 (M=Mo or W; R=SitBu3) were isolated from the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized silyl(silylidene) metal complexes Cp(CO)2M=Si(SitBu3)NHC with a mild Lewis acid (BPh3). Alternatively, treatment of the NHC&#8208;stabilized silylidene complex Cp(CO)2W=Si(SitBu3)NHC with stronger Lewis acids such as AlCl3 or B(C6F5)3 resulted in the reversible coordination of the Lewis acid to one of the carbonyl ligands. Computational investigations revealed that the dimerization of the intermediate metal silylidyne (M&#8801;Si) complex to a tetrahedral cluster instead of a planar four&#8208;membered ring is due to steric bulk.

      <title>Active and Unidirectional Acceleration of Biaryl Rotation by a Molecular Motor
</title>
      <dc:description>
An integrated molecular machine setup allows the transmission of potential energy from a motor unit onto a covalently connected, distant, and sterically strongly encumbered biaryl receiver. By action of the motor unit, single&#8208;bond rotation of the receiver is strongly accelerated and forced to proceed unidirectionally.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors possess immense potential as central driving units for future nanotechnology. Integration into larger molecular setups and transduction of their mechanical motions represents the current frontier of research. Herein we report on an integrated molecular machine setup allowing the transmission of potential energy from a motor unit onto a remote receiving entity. The setup consists of a motor unit connected covalently to a distant and sterically encumbered biaryl receiver. By action of the motor unit, single&#8208;bond rotation of the receiver is strongly accelerated and forced to proceed unidirectionally. The transmitted potential energy is directly measured as the extent to which energy degeneration is lifted in the thermal atropisomerization of this biaryl. Energy degeneracy is reduced by more than 1.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and rate accelerations of several orders of magnitude in terms of the rate constants are achieved.

      <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions During the Biosynthesis of Sorbicillinoids</title>
      <dc:description>
One for all: The biosynthetic pathway to dimeric sorbicillinoids and epoxysorbicillinol was reconstituted in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Expression and feeding experiments demonstrated that the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase SorD catalyzes epoxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder addition, and Michael addition reactions in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The sorbicillinoids are a class of biologically active and structurally diverse fungal polyketides arising from sorbicillin. Through co&#8208;expression of sorA, sorB, sorC, and sorD from Trichoderma reesei QM6a, the biosynthetic pathway to epoxysorbicillinol and dimeric sorbicillinoids, which resemble Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;like and Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;like products, was reconstituted in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Expression and feeding experiments demonstrated the crucial requirement of the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase SorD for the formation of dimeric sorbicillinoids, hybrid sorbicillinoids, and epoxysorbicillinol in&#8197;vivo. In contrast to prior reports, SorD catalyses neither the oxidation of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dihydrosorbicillin to sorbicillin nor the oxidation of sorbicillinol to oxosorbicillinol. This is the first report that both the intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder and Michael dimerization reactions, as well as the epoxidation of sorbicillinol are catalysed in&#8197;vivo by SorD.

      <title>Enriching and Quantifying Porous Single Layer 2D Polymers by Exfoliation of Chemically Modified van der Waals Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D polymer with pyrylium groups is transformed into a 2D polymer with pyridine groups by exposure to gaseous ammonia. Liquid phase exfoliation of the latter yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Nanosheet quantification shows that the exfoliation is comparable to graphite, demonstrating the promising potential of this approach, which could also be applied to covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
2D polymer sheets with six positively charged pyrylium groups at each pore edge in a stacked single crystal can be transformed into a 2D polymer with six pyridines per pore by exposure to gaseous ammonia. This reaction furnishes still a crystalline material with tunable protonation degree at regular nano&#8208;sized pores promising as separation membrane. The exfoliation is compared for both 2D polymers with the latter being superior. Its liquid phase exfoliation yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Monolayer contents of &#8776;30&#8201;% are achieved with &#8776;130&#8197;nm sized sheets in mg quantities, corresponding to tens of trillions of monolayers. Quantification of nanosheet sizes, layer number and mass shows that this exfoliation is comparable to graphite. Thus, we expect that recent advances in exfoliation of graphite or inorganic crystals (e.g. scale&#8208;up, printing etc.) can be directly applied to this 2D polymer as well as to covalent organic frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;2D polymer sheets with six positively charged pyrylium groups at each pore edge in a stacked single crystal can be transformed into a 2D polymer with six pyridines per pore by exposure to gaseous ammonia. This reaction furnishes still a crystalline material with tunable protonation degree at regular nano&#8208;sized pores promising as separation membrane. The exfoliation is compared for both 2D polymers with the latter being superior. Its liquid phase exfoliation yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Monolayer contents of &#8776;30&#8201;% are achieved with &#8776;130&#8197;nm sized sheets in mg quantities, corresponding to tens of trillions of monolayers. Quantification of nanosheet sizes, layer number and mass shows that this exfoliation is comparable to graphite. Thus, we expect that recent advances in exfoliation of graphite or inorganic crystals (e.g. scale&#8208;up, printing etc.) can be directly applied to this 2D polymer as well as to covalent organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regioselective Hydroalkylation and Arylalkylation of Alkynes by Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis: Application and Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Meditation on alkylation: A photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type hydroalkylation of terminal alkynes as well as a one&#8208;pot alkylarylation of alkynes with alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl bromides via a three&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling are presented. The reactions take place efficiently, with excellent regioselectivity and moderate to excellent stereoselectivity under mild conditions.







Abstract
Alkynes are an important class of organic molecules due to their utility as versatile building blocks in synthesis. Although efforts have been devoted to the difunctionalization of alkynes, general and practical strategies for the direct hydroalkylation and alkylarylation of terminal alkynes under mild reaction conditions are less explored. Herein, we report a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type hydroalkylation of terminal alkynes as well as a one&#8208;pot arylalkylation of alkynes with alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl bromides via a three&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling. The results indicate that the transformations proceed via a new mechanism involving a single&#8208;electron transfer with subsequent energy&#8208;transfer activation pathways. Moreover, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence&#8208;spectroscopy measurements, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and wavefunction analysis have been performed to give an insight into the catalytic cycle.

      <title>Promoting the Electrocatalytic Performance of Noble Metal Aerogels by Ligand&#8208;Directed Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>
Worth its weight in gold: Starting from laser&#8208;generated inorganic&#8208;salt&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles, various impurity&#8208;free noble metal aerogels are fabricated, allowing the investigation of their intrinsic properties. Moreover, prominent roles played by ligands, which are interpreted from electron transfer between NMAs and respective ligands, are demonstrated, offering a new dimension to engineer electrocatalytic properties of broad materials.







Abstract
Noble metal aerogels (NMAs) are an emerging class of porous materials. Embracing nano&#8208;sized highly&#8208;active noble metals and porous structures, they display unprecedented performance in diverse electrocatalytic processes. However, various impurities, particularly organic ligands, are often involved in the synthesis and remain in the corresponding products, hindering the investigation of the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of NMAs. Here, starting from laser&#8208;generated inorganic&#8208;salt&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles, various impurity&#8208;free NMAs (Au, Pd, and Au&#8208;Pd aerogels) were fabricated. In this light, we demonstrate not only the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of NMAs, but also the prominent roles played by ligands in tuning electrocatalysis through modulating the electron density of catalysts. These findings may offer a new dimension to engineer and optimize the electrocatalytic performance for various NMAs and beyond.

      <title>Substrate&#8208;Independent Magnetic Bistability in Monolayers of the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Dy2ScN@C80 on Metals and Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Monolayers of Dy2ScN@C80 exhibit magnetic hysteresis on Au, Ag, and MgO|Ag substrates. The substrates influence the ordering of the endohedral cluster, but do not affect the width of the hysteresis. The carbon cage protects the endohedral magnetic cluster and thus ensures that it sustains magnetic bistability.







Abstract
Magnetic hysteresis is demonstrated for monolayers of the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) Dy2ScN@C80 deposited on Au(111), Ag(100), and MgO|Ag(100) surfaces by vacuum sublimation. The topography and electronic structure of Dy2ScN@C80 adsorbed on Au(111) were studied by STM. X&#8208;ray magnetic CD studies show that the Dy2ScN@C80 monolayers exhibit similarly broad magnetic hysteresis independent on the substrate used, but the orientation of the Dy2ScN cluster depends strongly on the surface. DFT calculations show that the extent of the electronic interaction of the fullerene molecules with the surface is increasing dramatically from MgO to Au(111) and Ag(100). However, the charge redistribution at the fullerene&#8208;surface interface is fully absorbed by the carbon cage, leaving the state of the endohedral cluster intact. This Faraday cage effect of the fullerene preserves the magnetic bistability of fullerene&#8208;SMMs on conducting substrates and facilitates their application in molecular spintronics.

      <title>Image&#8208;Based Morphological Profiling Identifies a Lysosomotropic, Iron&#8208;Sequestering Autophagy Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>
I heard you paint cells: Morphological profiling using the &#8220;cell painting&#8221; assay revealed that autoquin impairs lysosomal integrity, iron homeostasis, and autophagy.







Abstract
Chemical proteomics is widely applied in small&#8208;molecule target identification. However, in general it does not identify non&#8208;protein small&#8208;molecule targets, and thus, alternative methods for target identification are in high demand. We report the discovery of the autophagy inhibitor autoquin and the identification of its molecular mode of action using image&#8208;based morphological profiling in the cell painting assay. A compound&#8208;induced fingerprint representing changes in 579 cellular parameters revealed that autoquin accumulates in lysosomes and inhibits their fusion with autophagosomes. In addition, autoquin sequesters Fe2+ in lysosomes, resulting in an increase of lysosomal reactive oxygen species and ultimately cell death. Such a mechanism of action would have been challenging to unravel by current methods. This work demonstrates the potential of the cell painting assay to deconvolute modes of action of small molecules, warranting wider application in chemical biology.

      <title>Triple&#8208;Helix&#8208;Stabilizing Effects in Collagen Model Peptides Containing PPII&#8208;Helix&#8208;Preorganized Diproline Modules</title>
      <dc:description>
Collagen model peptides represent attractive materials for biomedical applications. To rationally design peptide properties, knowledge about the impact of structural modifications is fundamental. Therefore, the impact of covalent diproline rigidification was studied and correlated with theoretical findings to understand the symphony of (de)stabilizing effects in the triple helix.







Abstract
Collagen model peptides (CMPs) serve as tools for understanding stability and function of the collagen triple helix and have a potential for biomedical applications. In the past, interstrand cross&#8208;linking or conformational preconditioning of proline units through stereoelectronic effects have been utilized in the design of stabilized CMPs. To further study the effects determining collagen triple helix stability we investigated a series of CMPs containing synthetic diproline&#8208;mimicking modules (ProMs), which were preorganized in a PPII&#8208;helix&#8208;type conformation by a functionalizable intrastrand C2 bridge. Results of CD&#8208;based denaturation studies were correlated with calculated (DFT) conformational preferences of the ProM units, revealing that the relative helix stability is mainly governed by an interplay of main&#8208;chain preorganization, ring&#8208;flip preference, adaptability, and steric effects. Triple helix integrity was proven by crystal structure analysis and binding to HSP47.

Results of CD&#8208;based denaturation studies were correlated with calculated (DFT) conformational preferences of the ProM units, revealing that the relative helix stability is mainly governed by an interplay of main&#8208;chain preorganization, ring&#8208;flip preference, adaptability, and steric effects. Triple helix integrity was proven by crystal structure analysis and binding to HSP47.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Adaptable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Macrocycle Hosting Copper in Three Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>
A neutral hybrid macrocycle L with two trans&#8208;positioned N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and two pyridine donors can adapt to the different geometric and electronic preferences of CuI, CuII, and CuIII. This allows isolation of a series of complexes hosting Cu in all three oxidation states, and their reversible interconversion at moderate potentials and with minor structural rearrangement.







Abstract
A neutral hybrid macrocycle with two trans&#8208;positioned N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and two pyridine donors hosts copper in three oxidation states (+I&#8211;+III) in a series of structurally characterized complexes (1&#8211;3). Redox interconversion of [LCu]+/2+/3+ is electrochemically (quasi)reversible and occurs at moderate potentials (E1/2=&#8722;0.45&#8197;V and +0.82&#8197;V (vs. Fc/Fc+)). A linear CNHC&#8208;Cu&#8208;CNHC arrangement and hemilability of the two pyridine donors allows the ligand to adapt to the different stereoelectronic and coordination requirements of CuI versus CuII/CuIII. Analytical methods such as NMR, UV/Vis, IR, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Cu K&#946; high&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution fluorescence detection X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations, give insight into the geometric and electronic structures of the complexes. The XAS signatures of 1&#8211;3 are textbook examples for CuI, CuII, and CuIII species. Facile 2&#8208;electron interconversion combined with the exposure of two basic pyridine N sites in the reduced CuI form suggest that [LCu]+/2+/3+ may operate in catalysis via coupled 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ transfer.

      <title>Structural Insight into IAPP&#8208;Derived Amyloid Inhibitors and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
      <dc:description>
ISM inhibitors are highly dynamic assemblies and exchange between monomeric and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight states. In both states, the ISM peptide adopts a &#946;&#8208;loop&#8208;like structure that provides a suitable surface for sequestration of A&#946;40 in the colloidal state. ISM inhibitors thus exploit multivalency by self&#8208;association to yield high substrate avidity.







Abstract
Designed peptides derived from the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) cross&#8208;amyloid interaction surface with A&#946; (termed interaction surface mimics or ISMs) have been shown to be highly potent inhibitors of A&#946; amyloid self&#8208;assembly. However, the molecular mechanism of their function is not well understood. Using solution&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy in combination with ensemble&#8208;averaged dynamics simulations and other biophysical methods including TEM, fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, and DLS, we characterize ISM structural preferences and interactions. We find that the ISM peptide R3&#8208;GI is highly dynamic, can adopt a &#946;&#8208;like structure, and oligomerizes into colloid&#8208;like assemblies in a process that is reminiscent of liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Our results suggest that such assemblies yield multivalent surfaces for interactions with A&#946;40. Sequestration of substrates into these colloid&#8208;like structures provides a mechanistic basis for ISM function and the design of novel potent anti&#8208;amyloid molecules.

      <title>Effective and Reversible Carbon Dioxide Insertion into Cerium Pyrazolates</title>
      <dc:description>
CO2 sponges: Cerous and ceric pyrazolates have been demonstrated to insert carbon dioxide and afford the complexes [CeIII4(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)4]. The insertion is reversible and can be exploited for the catalytic formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides. The potentially reducing behavior of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co&#8208;catalyst is also revealed.







Abstract
The homoleptic pyrazolate complexes [CeIII4(Me2pz)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz)4]2 quantitatively insert CO2 to give [CeIII4(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)4], respectively (Me2pz=3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazolato). This process is reversible for both complexes, as observed by in&#8197;situ IR and NMR spectroscopy in solution and by TGA in the solid state. By adjusting the molar ratio, one molecule of CO2 per [CeIV(Me2pz)4] complex could be inserted to give trimetallic [Ce3(Me2pz)9(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)3(thf)]. Both the cerous and ceric insertion products catalyze the formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 under mild conditions. In the absence of epoxide, the ceric catalyst is prone to reduction by the co&#8208;catalyst tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium bromide (TBAB).

      <title>Advanced Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple strain approach was explored to prepare a NiFe&#8208;based ORR/OER electrocatalyst derived from surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks by rational introduction of functional groups into the organic linker. The catalyst exhibits an excellent OER activity, reaching industrially relevant current densities. As a bifunctional catalyst, it demonstrates a narrow overpotential window of &#8776;0.69&#8197;V in 0.1&#8201;m KOH, surpassing reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are considered as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are important for many energy provision technologies, such as electrolyzers, fuel cells and some types of advanced batteries. In this work, a &#8220;strain modulation&#8221; approach has been applied through the use of surface&#8208;mounted NiFe&#8208;MOFs in order to design an advanced bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst. The material exhibits an excellent OER activity in alkaline media, reaching an industrially relevant current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of only &#8776;210&#8197;mV. It demonstrates operational long&#8208;term stability even at a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits the so far narrowest &#8220;overpotential window&#8221; &#916;EORR&#8208;OER of 0.69&#8197;V in 0.1&#8201;m KOH with a mass loading being two orders of magnitude lower than that of benchmark electrocatalysts.

      <title>Amphiphilic Polyphenylene Dendron Conjugates for Surface Remodeling of Adenovirus&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
Amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrons were prepared and bound to gene vector adenovirus 5 (Ad5) through polar and nonpolar surface groups that control its cellular uptake. The new dendron layer at the Ad5 surface provides reactive groups that are accessible for post&#8208;modifications at the virus surface.







Abstract
Amphiphilic surface groups play an important role in many biological processes. The synthesis of amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrimer branches (dendrons), providing alternating hydrophilic and lipophilic surface groups and one reactive ethynyl group at the core is reported. The amphiphilic surface groups serve as biorecognition units that bind to the surface of adenovirus&#8197;5 (Ad5), which is a common vector in gene therapy. The Ad5/dendron complexes showed high gene transduction efficiencies in coxsackie&#8208;adenovirus receptor (CAR)&#8208;negative cells. Moreover, the dendrons offer incorporation of new functions at the dendron core by in situ post&#8208;modifications, even when bound to the Ad5 surface. Surfaces coated with these dendrons were analyzed for their blood&#8208;protein binding capacity, which is essential to predict their performance in the blood stream. A new platform for introducing bioactive groups to the Ad5 surface without chemically modifying the virus particles is provided.

      <title>A Supported Bismuth Halide Perovskite Photocatalyst for Selective Aliphatic and Aromatic C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Better with bismuth: A range of mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;supported small bismuth halide perovskite nanoparticles were prepared. They were found to be very promising photocatalysts for selective aromatic and aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Direct selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to oxygenates by O2 is challenging. Catalysts are limited by the low activity and narrow application scope, and the main focus is on active C&#8722;H bonds at benzylic positions. In this work, stable, lead&#8208;free, Cs3Bi2Br9 halide perovskites are integrated within the pore channels of mesoporous SBA&#8208;15 silica and demonstrate their photocatalytic potentials for C&#8722;H bond activation. The composite photocatalysts can effectively oxidize hydrocarbons (C5 to C16 including aromatic and aliphatic alkanes) with a conversion rate up to 32900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and excellent selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) towards aldehydes and ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Isotopic labeling, in&#8197;situ spectroscopic studies, and DFT calculations reveal that well&#8208;dispersed small perovskite nanoparticles (2&#8211;5&#8197;nm) possess enhanced electron&#8211;hole separation and a close contact with hydrocarbons that facilitates C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photoinduced charges.

      <title>Confined Crystallization of Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles in Block&#8208;Copolymer Micelles</title>
      <dc:description>
Spin doctor: The synthesis and characterization of spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles with improved spin&#8208;crossover properties in a block&#8208;copolymer matrix gives a spin&#8208;crossover nanocomposite which is stable enough to allow further processing, such as electrospinning from solution.







Abstract
Nanoparticles of the spin&#8208;crossover coordination polymer [FeL(bipy)]n were synthesized by confined crystallization within the core of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles. The 4VP units in the micellar core act as coordination sites for the Fe complex. In the bulk material, the spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles in the core are well isolated from each other allowing thermal treatment without disintegration of their structure. During annealing above the glass transition temperature of the PS block, the transition temperature is shifted gradually to higher temperatures from the as&#8208;synthesized product (T1/2&#8595;=163&#8197;K and T1/2&#8593;=170&#8197;K) to the annealed product (T1/2&#8595;=203&#8197;K and T1/2&#8593;=217&#8197;K) along with an increase in hysteresis width from 6&#8197;K to 14&#8197;K. Thus, the spin&#8208;crossover properties can be shifted towards the properties of the related bulk material. The stability of the nanocomposite allows further processing, such as electrospinning from solution.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Cooperation of Single&#8208;Atom Rh and Ru Solid Catalysts for a Selective Tandem Olefin Isomerization&#8208;Hydrosilylation Process</title>
      <dc:description>
Singles in tandem: The one&#8208;pot integration of Ru1/CeO2 and Rh1/CeO2 single&#8208;atom solid catalysts enables a highly selective olefin isomerization&#8208;hydrosilylation tandem process for the conversion of terminal and internal olefins, as well as mixtures thereof, into industrially relevant terminal organosilane compounds.







Abstract
Realizing the full potential of oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) is key to successfully bridge the gap between the fields of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Here we show that the one&#8208;pot combination of Ru1/CeO2 and Rh1/CeO2 SACs enables a highly selective olefin isomerization&#8208;hydrosilylation tandem process, hitherto restricted to molecular catalysts in solution. Individually, monoatomic Ru and Rh sites show a remarkable reaction specificity for olefin double&#8208;bond migration and anti&#8208;Markovnikov &#945;&#8208;olefin hydrosilylation, respectively. First&#8208;principles DFT calculations ascribe such selectivity to differences in the binding strength of the olefin substrate to the monoatomic metal centers. The single&#8208;pot cooperation of the two SACs allows the production of terminal organosilane compounds with high regio&#8208;selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) even from industrially&#8208;relevant complex mixtures of terminal and internal olefins, alongside a straightforward catalyst recycling and reuse. These results demonstrate the significance of oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal catalysts in tandem catalytic reactions, which are central for the intensification of chemical processes.

      <dc:description>
The death cap toxin &#945;&#8208;amanitin has received increasing attention as a toxin component of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates in cancer research. A new route to this bicyclic octapeptide that is based on a convergent approach in solution phase is reported by R.&#8197;D. S&#252;ssmuth and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;5500. The straightforward synthesis gives access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids l&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on multigram scale.

      <dc:description>
Spatially resolved covalent patterning of graphene is achieved based on three important reaction principles: reductive activation of the carbon lattice, antaratopic binding, and classical lithography. As shown by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;5602, reversible defunctionalization of the patterned graphene allows the storage of chemical information by establishing complete write/store/erase cycles.

      <title>Inside Cover: A Room&#8208;Temperature Verwey&#8208;type Transition in Iron Oxide, Fe5O6 (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry was synthesized by S.&#8197;V. Ovsyannikov and co&#8208;workers, as reported in their Communication on page&#8197;5632. Near 275&#8197;K, the material undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for use in innovative applications.

      <title>Towards Reliable and Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS): From Key Parameters to Good Analytical Practice</title>
      <dc:description>
Parameters and pitfalls: Key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are highlighted. Good analytical practice is proposed to increase the inter&#8208;laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.







Abstract
Experimental results obtained in different laboratories world&#8208;wide by researchers using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can differ significantly. We, an international team of scientists with long&#8208;standing expertise in SERS, address this issue from our perspective by presenting considerations on reliable and quantitative SERS. The central idea of this joint effort is to highlight key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in the literature. To that end, we provide here a series of recommendations on: a)&#8197;the characterization of solid and colloidal SERS substrates by correlative electron and optical microscopy and spectroscopy, b)&#8197;on the determination of the SERS enhancement factor (EF), including suitable Raman reporter/probe molecules, and finally on c)&#8197;good analytical practice. We hope that both newcomers and specialists will benefit from these recommendations to increase the inter&#8208;laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.

      <title>Polyhalogen and Polyinterhalogen Anions from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
      <dc:description>
The diverse field of polyhalogen anions and polyinterhalide chemistry is explored in terms of the structural diversity and chemical behavior of these anions as well as their applications. While the first anions of this class were described almost one hundred years ago, recent research has focused on the synthesis, structural diversity, and bonding of polyhalogen anions of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.







Abstract
This Review deals with the evolving field of polyhalogen chemistry, specifically polyhalogen anions (polyhalides). In addition to a historical outline, current progress in synthetic approaches towards the formation of polyfluorides, polychlorides, polybromides, and polyinterhalides is also illustrated. The structural diversity of polyhalides has substantially increased in the past decade, especially for polychlorides and polybromides, which are commonly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Polyfluorides have been examined by sophisticated state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and investigated spectroscopically in noble gas matrix&#8208;isolation experiments under cryogenic conditions at 4&#8197;K. The bonding in such polyhalide systems is also discussed. The last Section deals with applications of polyhalides in halogenation reactions and electrochemistry as well as their use as reactive ionic liquids, emphasizing the promising future of polyhalogen chemistry.

      <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Thianthrenation of Olefins To Access Versatile Alkenyl Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
The regioselective synthesis of sulfonium&#8208;based alkenyl electrophiles was achieved directly through C&#8722;H functionalization of simple olefins. The alkenyl sulfonium salts participate in palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed (pseudo)halogenation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a regioselective alkenyl electrophile synthesis from unactivated olefins that is based on a direct and regioselective C&#8722;H thianthrenation reaction. The selectivity is proposed to arise from an unusual inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The alkenyl sulfonium salts can serve as electrophiles in palladium&#8208; and ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions to make alkenyl C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;Br, and C&#8722;SCF3 bonds with stereoretention.

      <title>Helical Nanographenes Containing an Azulene Unit: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
An odd contribution: Azulene&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes with global aromaticity are synthesized by a Scholl&#8208;type cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly reveals the formation of an azulene unit in the helical &#960;&#8208;system. The embedded azulene core adopts a highly twisted conformation and is less aromatic than pristine azulene.







Abstract
Three unprecedented helical nanographenes (1, 2, and 3) containing an azulene unit are synthesized. The resultant helical structures are unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The embedded azulene unit in 2 possesses a record&#8208;high twisting degree (16.1&#176;) as a result of the contiguous steric repulsion at the helical inner rim. Structural analysis in combination with theoretical calculations reveals that these helical nanographenes manifest a global aromatic structure, while the inner azulene unit exhibits weak antiaromatic character. Furthermore, UV/Vis&#8208;spectral measurements reveal that superhelicenes 2 and 3 possess narrow energy gaps (2: 1.88&#8197;eV; 3: 2.03&#8197;eV), as corroborated by cyclic voltammetry and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The stable oxidized and reduced states of 2 and 3 are characterized by in&#8208;situ EPR/Vis&#8211;NIR spectroelectrochemistry. Our study provides a novel synthetic strategy for helical nanographenes containing azulene units as well as their associated structures and physical properties.

      <title>Oxalyl&#8208;CoA Decarboxylase Enables Nucleophilic One&#8208;Carbon Extension of Aldehydes to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
The thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily contains promiscuous members that can perform nucleophilic C1&#8208;extensions of aldehydes to yield 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. An enzymatic cascade consisting of OXC, oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase, and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase converted oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
The synthesis of complex molecules from simple, renewable carbon units is the goal of a sustainable economy. Here we explored the biocatalytic potential of the thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily that naturally catalyzes the shortening of acyl&#8208;CoA thioester substrates through the release of the C1&#8208;unit formyl&#8208;CoA. We show that the OXC/HACL superfamily contains promiscuous members that can be reversed to perform nucleophilic C1&#8208;extensions of various aldehydes to yield the corresponding 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. We improved the catalytic properties of Methylorubrum extorquens OXC by rational enzyme engineering and combined it with two newly described enzymes&#8212;a specific oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase. This enzymatic cascade enabled continuous conversion of oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into valuable (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.

     alt="Oxalyl&#8208;CoA Decarboxylase Enables Nucleophilic One&#8208;Carbon Extension of Aldehydes to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent&lt;/b&gt; (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily contains promiscuous members that can perform nucleophilic C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;extensions of aldehydes to yield 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. An enzymatic cascade consisting of OXC, oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase, and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase converted oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of complex molecules from simple, renewable carbon units is the goal of a sustainable economy. Here we explored the biocatalytic potential of the thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily that naturally catalyzes the shortening of acyl&#8208;CoA thioester substrates through the release of the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;unit formyl&#8208;CoA. We show that the OXC/HACL superfamily contains promiscuous members that can be reversed to perform nucleophilic C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;extensions of various aldehydes to yield the corresponding 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. We improved the catalytic properties of Methylorubrum extorquens OXC by rational enzyme engineering and combined it with two newly described enzymes&#8212;a specific oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase. This enzymatic cascade enabled continuous conversion of oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into valuable (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Unexpected Transannular [4+2] Cycloaddition during the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Norcembrene&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
They may look alike&#8230; During studies toward the total synthesis of the norditerpene natural product norcembrene&#8197;5, one diastereomer of a key intermediate (&#945;&#8208;OAc at C13) underwent clean and spontaneous Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition at room temperature (see scheme). However, the corresponding &#946;&#8197;isomer did not undergo a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but was oxidized to the corresponding furanone, which was further transformed into norcembrene&#8197;5.







Abstract
We report a concise and versatile total synthesis of the diterpenoid (+)&#8208;norcembrene&#8197;5 from simple building blocks. Ring&#8208;closing metathesis and an auxiliary&#8208;directed 1,4&#8208;addition are the key steps of our synthetic route. During the synthesis, an unprecedented, highly oxidized pentacyclic structural motif was established from a furanocembranoid through transannular [4+2] cycloaddition.

      <title>Phosphanylalanes and Phosphanylgallanes Stabilized only by a Lewis Base</title>
      <dc:description>
Back to bases: The first parent phosphanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes stabilized only by a Lewis base were synthesized. These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl and LiPH2&#8901;DME and a H2 elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H3 and PH3, respectively.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the first parent phosphanylalane and phosphanylgallane stabilized only by a Lewis base (LB) are reported. The corresponding substituted compounds, such as IDipp&#8901;GaH2PCy2 (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were obtained by the reaction of LiPCy2 with IDipp&#8901;GaH2Cl. However, the LB&#8208;stabilized parent compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH2PH2 (3) and IDipp&#8901;AlH2PH2 (4) were prepared via a salt metathesis of LiPH2&#8901;DME with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) or by H2&#8208;elimination reactions of IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H3 (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) and PH3, respectively. The compounds could be isolated as crystalline solids and completely characterized. Supporting DFT computations gave insight into the reaction pathways as well as into the stability of these compounds with respect to their decomposition behavior.

      <title>Supracolloidal Self&#8208;Assembly of Divalent Janus 3D DNA Origami via Programmable Multivalent Host/Guest Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Combined forces: Adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin functionalized 3D DNA origami Janus colloids are used for cooperative multivalent interaction enhancement of supramolecular host/guest interactions resulting in 1D&#8208;fibril formation. The merger of DNA nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry gives access to study multivalent effects at a colloidal level.







Abstract
We introduce divalent 3D DNA origami cuboids as truly monodisperse colloids and harness their ability for precision functionalization with defined patches and defined numbers of supramolecular binding motifs. We demonstrate that even adamantane/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin host/guest inclusion complexes of moderate association strength can induce efficient supracolloidal fibrillization at high dilution of the 3D DNA Origami as a result of cooperative multivalency. We show details on the assembly of Janus and non&#8208;Janus 3D DNA origami into supracolloidal homo&#8208; and heterofibrils with respect to multivalency effects, electrostatic screening, and stoichiometry. We believe that the merger of 3D DNA origami with colloidal self&#8208;assembly and supramolecular motifs provides new synergies at the interface of these disciplines to better understand multivalency effects, to promote structural complexity, and add non&#8208;DNA assembling and switching mechanisms to DNA nanoscience.

      <title>[SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+: Highly Coordinated Sn+III8 Subunit with Fragile Carbonyl Clips</title>
      <dc:description>
You're clinging! In a clip&#8208;like fashion, Fe(CO)4 groups surround a central SnI8 subunit in [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+, which has an unprecedentedly high coordination of tin with the most voluminous, stable halide.







Abstract
[SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4][Al2Cl7]2 contains the [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+ cation with an unprecedented highly coordinated, bicapped SnI8 prism. Given the eightfold coordination with the most voluminous stable halide, it is all the more surprising that this SnI8 arrangement is surrounded only by fragile Fe(CO)4 groups in a clip&#8208;like fashion. Inspite of a predominantly ionic bonding situation in [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+, the I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722; distances are considerably shortened (down to 371&#8197;pm) and significantly less than the van der Waals distance (420&#8197;pm). The title compound is characterized by single&#8208;crystal structure analysis, spectroscopic methods (EDXS, FTIR, Raman, UV/Vis, M&#246;ssbauer), thermogravimetry, and density functional theory methods.

1&#8208;Aminopyrenes with three &#969;&#8208;hydroxylated N&#8208;alkylsulfonamido or alkylsulfonyl residues in positions 3, 6, and 8 were prepared, O&#8208;phosphorylated, and applied for reductive amination of oligosaccharides. The dyes (&#1013;&#8776;20&#8201;000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) with six negative charges (pH&#8805;8) and low m/z ratios enable labeling and fluorescence detection of reducing sugars (glycans) related to the most structurally and functionally diverse class of natural products. Under excitation with a 488&#8197;nm laser, the new glycoconjugates emit yellow light of about 560&#8197;nm, outperforming (with respect to brightness and faster electrophoretic mobilities) the corresponding APTS derivatives (benchmark dye with green emission in conjugates).

      <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Functionalized Alkylzinc Reagents with (Hetero)Aryl Halides</title>
      <dc:description>
A cheap Co&#8208;upling: A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of functionalized primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl halides is described. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions using secondary cyclohexylzinc reagents proceed in a highly diastereoselective fashion furnishing the corresponding products in up to 98:2 d.r.

Abstract
A combination of 10&#8201;% CoCl2 and 20&#8201;% 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands enables cross&#8208;coupling of functionalized primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents with various (hetero)aryl halides. Couplings with 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;substituted cycloalkylzinc reagents proceeded diastereoselectively leading to functionalized heterocycles with high diastereoselectivities of up to 98:2. Furthermore, alkynyl bromides react with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents providing the alkylated alkynes.

Abstract
A highly atroposelective (up to 97&#8201;% ee) Au&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;diols is reported starting from a range of substituted benzyl alkynones.

      <title>1,1&#8208;Ethenediol: The Long Elusive Enol of Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Finally made: The hitherto unreported 1,1&#8208;ethenediol, the higher energy tautomer of acetic acid, was synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. It can be readily prepared through thermal decarboxylation of malonic acid, as has generally often been implied in the synthetically highly valuable reactions of 1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acids.







Abstract
We present the first spectroscopic identification of hitherto unknown 1,1&#8208;ethenediol, the enol tautomer of acetic acid. The title compound was generated in the gas phase through flash vacuum pyrolysis of malonic acid at 400&#8201;&#176;C. The pyrolysis products were subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10&#8197;K and characterized spectroscopically by means of IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy together with matching its spectral data with computations at the CCSD(T)/cc&#8208;pCVTZ and B3LYP/6&#8211;311++G(2d,2p) levels of theory. Upon photolysis at &#955;=254&#8197;nm, the enol rearranges to acetic acid and ketene.

      <title>Functional Disruption of the Cancer&#8208;Relevant Interaction between Survivin and Histone H3 with a Guanidiniocarbonyl Pyrrole Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
Effective interruption: The supramolecular guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole ligand L1 targets the Histone H3 binding site of the protein Survivin, which is highly upregulated in cancer. Inhibiting the interaction between the two proteins successfully reduced cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The protein Survivin is highly upregulated in most cancers and considered to be a key player in carcinogenesis. We explored a supramolecular approach to address Survivin as a drug target by inhibiting the protein&#8211;protein interaction of Survivin and its functionally relevant binding partner Histone H3. Ligand L1 is based on the guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole cation and serves as a highly specific anion binder in order to target the interaction between Survivin and Histone H3. NMR titration confirmed binding of L1 to Survivin's Histone H3 binding site. The inhibition of the Survivin&#8211;Histone H3 interaction and consequently a reduction of cancer cell proliferation were demonstrated by microscopic and cellular assays.

      <title>Analysis of an Active Deformylation Mechanism of 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) in Stem Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Please release Me, let Me go: The demethylation process of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC), which is associated with the reactivation of silenced genes, was investigated. In the course of active demethylation in stem cells, mdC is oxidized to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC), which is then deformylated, potentially after addition of a nucleophile at the C6&#8208;position.







Abstract
The removal of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC) from promoter elements is associated with reactivation of the silenced corresponding genes. It takes place through an active demethylation process involving the oxidation of mdC to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (hmdC) and further on to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;deoxycytidine (cadC) with the help of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent Tet oxygenases. The next step can occur through the action of a glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome for replacement by dC. A second pathway is proposed to involve C&#8722;C bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. A 6&#8208;aza&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (a&#8208;fdC) probe molecule was synthesized and fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mouse embryonic stem cells, together with a 2&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated fdC analogue (F&#8208;fdC). While deformylation of F&#8208;fdC was clearly observed in&#8197;vivo, it did not occur with a&#8208;fdC, thus suggesting that the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleaving deformylation is initiated by nucleophilic activation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please release Me, let Me go&lt;/b&gt;: The demethylation process of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC), which is associated with the reactivation of silenced genes, was investigated. In the course of active demethylation in stem cells, mdC is oxidized to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC), which is then deformylated, potentially after addition of a nucleophile at the C6&#8208;position.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC) from promoter elements is associated with reactivation of the silenced corresponding genes. It takes place through an active demethylation process involving the oxidation of mdC to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (hmdC) and further on to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;deoxycytidine (cadC) with the help of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent Tet oxygenases. The next step can occur through the action of a glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome for replacement by dC. A second pathway is proposed to involve C&#8722;C bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. A 6&#8208;aza&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (a&#8208;fdC) probe molecule was synthesized and fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mouse embryonic stem cells, together with a 2&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated fdC analogue (F&#8208;fdC). While deformylation of F&#8208;fdC was clearly observed in&#8197;vivo, it did not occur with a&#8208;fdC, thus suggesting that the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleaving deformylation is initiated by nucleophilic activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biosynthesis of Pseudomonas&#8208;Derived Butenolides</title>

Diversity&#8208;oriented biosynthesis: Styrolides are a novel class of bacterially produced butenolides that represent a structural and biosynthetic link between tetronic acids and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones. A comprehensive picture of the biosynthesis of the styrolides and related acaterin is provided.







Abstract
Butenolides are well&#8208;known signaling molecules in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Here, we describe a novel class of butenolides isolated from a Gram&#8208;negative Pseudomonas strain, the styrolides. Structure elucidation was aided by the total synthesis of styrolide&#8197;A. Transposon mutagenesis enabled us to identify the styrolide biosynthetic gene cluster, and by using a homology search, we discovered the related and previously unknown acaterin biosynthetic gene cluster in another Pseudomonas species. Mutagenesis, heterologous expression, and identification of key shunt and intermediate products were crucial to propose a biosynthetic pathway for both Pseudomonas&#8208;derived butenolides. Comparative transcriptomics suggests a link between styrolide formation and the regulatory networks of the bacterium.

Electrochemical access to aza&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (aza&#8208;PAHs) was achieved via rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed domino C&#8722;H functionalization. A multifunctional O&#8208;methylamidoxime facilitates the high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (aza&#8208;PAHs) have found broad applications in material sciences. Herein, a modular electrochemical synthesis of aza&#8208;PAHs was developed via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H activation and alkyne annulation. A multifunctional O&#8208;methylamidoxime enabled the high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The isolation of two key rhodacyclic intermediates made it possible to delineate the exact order of three C&#8722;H activation steps.

      <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization&#8212;Prediction of Selectivity in Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Competition Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Assessment of an iridium(I) catalyst for C&#8722;H activation in the deuteration of phenyl compounds substituted with different functional directing groups is disclosed. Competition experiments and DFT calculations have revealed a clear order of the directing groups in hydrogen isotope exchange reactions.







Abstract
An assessment of the C&#8722;H activation catalyst [(COD)Ir(IMes)(PPh3)]PF6 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) in the deuteration of phenyl rings containing different functional directing groups is divulged. Competition experiments have revealed a clear order of the directing groups in the hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with an iridium&#8197;(I) catalyst. Through DFT calculations the iridium&#8211;substrate coordination complex has been identified to be the main trigger for reactivity and selectivity in the competition situation with two or more directing groups. We postulate that the competition concept found in this HIE reaction can be used to explain regioselectivities in other transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization reactions of complex drug&#8208;type molecules as long as a C&#8722;H activation mechanism is involved.

      <title>A Universal Nano&#8208;capillary Based Method of Catalyst Immobilization for Liquid&#8208;Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel universal method of single catalyst nanoparticle immobilization on the working electrode without damaging the fragile membrane allows single NixB nanoparticle catalysts to be monitored in&#8197;situ during ethanol oxidation by means of TEM movies.







Abstract
A universal nano&#8208;capillary based method for sample deposition on the silicon nitride membrane of liquid&#8208;cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) chips is demonstrated. It is applicable to all substances which can be dispersed in a solvent and are suitable for drop casting, including catalysts, biological samples, and polymers. Most importantly, this method overcomes limitations concerning sample immobilization due to the fragility of the ultra&#8208;thin silicon nitride membrane required for electron transmission. Thus, a straightforward way is presented to widen the research area of LCTEM to encompass any sample which can be externally deposited beforehand. Using this method, NixB nanoparticles are deposited on the &#956;m&#8208;scale working electrode of the LCTEM chip and in&#8197;situ observation of single catalyst particles during ethanol oxidation is for the first time successfully monitored by means of TEM movies.

      <title>Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Transfer Reactions for Mild O&#8208;H Functionalization of Unreactive Alcohols
</title>
      <dc:description>
A light&#8208;bulb moment: Photoinduced proton&#8208;transfer reactions of diazoacetates enable the highly efficient O&#8208;H functionalization of halogenated, unreactive alcohols under stoichiometric reaction conditions. This approach offers a new reactivity pattern of diazoacetates.







Abstract
Hexafluoroisopropanol is typically considered as an unreactive solvent and not as a reagent in organic synthesis. Herein, we report on a mild and efficient photochemical reaction of aryl diazoacetates with hexafluoroisopropanol that enables, under stoichiometric reaction conditions, the synthesis of fluorinated ethers in excellent yield. Mechanistic studies indicate there is a preorganization of hexafluoroisopropanol and the diazoalkane acts as an unreactive hydrogen&#8208;bonding complex. Only after photoexcitation does this complex undergo a protonation&#8208;substitution reaction to the reaction product. Investigations on the applicability of this photochemical transformation show that a broad variety of acidic alcohols can be subjected to this transformation and thus demonstrate the feasibility of this concept for O&#8208;H functionalization reactions (54 examples, up to 98&#8201;% yield).

      <title>Complex Carbocyclic Skeletons from Aryl Ketones through a Three&#8208;Photon Cascade Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Running up that hill: A major bond reorganization takes the marked arene carbon atom from &#8220;flatland&#8221; to the summit of three&#8208;dimensional hydrocarbon hills. Three photons initiate a cascade reaction to convert the flat aromatic cores of the starting materials into functionalized pentacyclic hydrocarbons (11 examples, 37&#8211;67&#8201;%) that are prone to further ring opening in&#8197;situ or through a two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Starting from readily available 7&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;indanones, products with a tetracyclo[5.3.1.01,704,11]undec&#8208;2&#8208;ene skeleton were obtained upon irradiation at &#955;=350&#8197;nm (eight examples, 49&#8211;67&#8201;% yield). The assembly of the structurally complex carbon framework proceeds in a three&#8208;photon process comprising an ortho photocycloaddition, a disrotatory [4&#960;] photocyclization, and a di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement. The flat aromatic core of the starting material is converted into a functionalized polycyclic hydrocarbon with exit vectors in three dimensions. Ring opening reactions at the central cyclopropane ring were explored, which enable the preparation of tricyclo[5.3.1.04,11]undec&#8208;2&#8208;enes and of tricyclo[6.2.1.01,5]undecanes.

      <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Verwey&#8208;type Transition in Iron Oxide, Fe5O6</title>
      <dc:description>
Charge and order: Crystals of novel mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with an unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry were synthesized and investigated. Near 275&#8197;K, Fe5O6 demonstrates a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a pronounced dimerization and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe chemical bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a highly promising candidate for use in innovative applications.







Abstract
Functional oxides whose physicochemical properties may be reversibly changed at standard conditions are potential candidates for the use in next&#8208;generation nanoelectronic devices. To date, vanadium dioxide (VO2) is the only known simple transition&#8208;metal oxide that demonstrates a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;insulator transition that may be used in such appliances. In this work, we synthesized and investigated the crystals of a novel mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with an unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry. Near 275&#8197;K, Fe5O6 undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and a following formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe chemical bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for the use in innovative applications. We established that the minimal Fe&#8722;Fe distance in the octahedral chains is a key parameter that determines the type and temperature of charge ordering. This model provides new insights into charge&#8208;ordering phenomena in transition&#8208;metal oxides in general.

      <title>A Convergent Total Synthesis of the Death Cap Toxin &#945;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A new route to the toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is presented. The key steps of the convergent [5+1+2]&#8208;synthesis are the preformation of the thioether building block and access to the enantiomerically pure non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on a multigram scale. The peptide fragment based methodology is the first convergent &#945;&#8208;amanitin synthesis fully performed in solution phase.







Abstract
The toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is mostly found in different species of the mushroom genus Amanita, with the death cap (Amanita phalloides) as one of the most prominent members. Due to its high selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II, which is directly linked to its high toxicity, particularly to hepatocytes, &#945;&#8208;amanitin received an increased attention as a toxin&#8208;component of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADC) in cancer research. Furthermore, the isolation of &#945;&#8208;amanitin from mushrooms as the sole source severely restricts compound supply as well as further investigations, as structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Based on a straightforward access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid dihydroxyisoleucine, we herein present a robust total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amanitin providing options for production at larger scale as well as future structural diversifications.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,12&#8208;Disubstituted [4]Helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Minimalistic helicenes: The use of a chiral gold catalyst bearing an &#945;&#8208;cationic TADDOL&#8208;derived phosphonite as an ancillary ligand allows the enantioselective assembly of 1,12&#8208;disubstituted [4]helicenes&#8212;one of the smallest helical polyarene architectures.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective synthesis of 1,12&#8208;disubstituted [4]carbohelicenes is reported. The key step for the developed synthetic route is a Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation, which is achieved with good to excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity by employing TADDOL&#8208;derived (TADDOL=&#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol) &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonites as ancillary ligands. Moreover, an appropriate design of the substrate makes the assembly of [4]helicenes of different substitution patterns possible, thus demonstrating the synthetic utility of the method. The absolute stereochemistry of the newly prepared structures was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterization of their photophysical properties is also reported.

      <title>Stable Salts of Heteroleptic Iron Carbonyl/Nitrosyl Cations</title>
      <dc:description>
Ready to use&#8230;! Two novel iron carbonyl/nitrosyl cations in the elusive oxidation state +I are now easily accessible as stable salts of the weakly coordinating anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. They may serve as simple model systems for the investigation of the nature of the Fe&#8722;NO bond to further understand the (bio&#8208;)chemistry of iron nitrosyl complexes.







Abstract
The oxidation of Fe(CO)5 with the [NO]+ salt of the weakly coordinating perfluoroalkoxyaluminate anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) leads to stable salts of the 18&#8197;valence electron (VE) species [Fe(CO)4(NO)]+ and [Fe(CO)(NO)3]+ with the Enemark&#8211;Feltham numbers of {FeNO}8 and {FeNO}10. This finally concludes the triad of heteroleptic iron carbonyl/nitrosyl complexes, since the first discovery of the anionic ([Fe(CO)3(NO)]&#8722;) and neutral ([Fe(CO)2(NO)2]) species over 80&#8197;years ago. Both complexes were fully characterized (IR, Raman, NMR, UV/Vis, scXRD, pXRD) and are stable at room temperature under inert conditions over months and may serve as useful starting materials for further investigations.

&lt;p&gt;The oxidation of Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with the [NO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salt of the weakly coordinating perfluoroalkoxyaluminate anion [F&#8208;{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) leads to stable salts of the 18&#8197;valence electron (VE) species [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Fe(CO)(NO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with the Enemark&#8211;Feltham numbers of {FeNO}&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and {FeNO}&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. This finally concludes the triad of heteroleptic iron carbonyl/nitrosyl complexes, since the first discovery of the anionic ([Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and neutral ([Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) species over 80&#8197;years ago. Both complexes were fully characterized (IR, Raman, NMR, UV/Vis, scXRD, pXRD) and are stable at room temperature under inert conditions over months and may serve as useful starting materials for further investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Mapping of Impurities in Partially Reduced Hollow TiO2 Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Impure thoughts: Precise characterization of impurities is critical for understanding and enhancing the functional properties of nanomaterials. The structure&#8211;property relationships of partially reduced hollow TiO2 nanowires are characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Oxygen vacancies and undesired boron, sodium, and nitrogen trace impurities are detected on the surface.







Abstract
The incorporation of impurities during the chemical synthesis of nanomaterials is usually uncontrolled and rarely reported because of the formidable challenge in measuring trace amounts of often light elements with sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution. And yet, these foreign elements (introduced by doping, for example) influence functional properties. We demonstrate how the hydrothermal growth and a partial reduction reaction on hollow TiO2 nanowires leads to the introduction of parts per millions of boron, sodium, and nitrogen. This doping explains the presence of oxygen vacancies and reduced Ti states at the surface, which enhance the functional properties of TiO2. Our results were obtained on model metal oxide nanomaterials and they shed light on a general process that leads to the uncontrolled incorporation of trace impurities in TiO2, thereby, having a strong effect on applications in energy&#8208;harvesting.

      <title>Cooperative Catalysis for the Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective [4+3]&#8208;Cycloannulation of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides and Carbonyl Ylides</title>
      <dc:description>
It takes two: A combination of Rh2(OAc)4 and a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzes the in&#8201;situ generation of transient carbonyl ylides and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonded ortho&#8208;quinone methides through cooperative catalytic cycles. These transient species then undergo a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cycloannulation to afford a broad range of functionalized oxa&#8208;bridged dibenzooxacines featuring two quaternary and one tertiary stereogenic centers.







Abstract
We describe herein a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [4+3]&#8208;cycloannulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides and carbonyl ylides to furnish functionalized oxa&#8208;bridged dibenzooxacines with excellent yields and stereoselectivity in a single synthetic step. The combination of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalysis working in concert to generate both transient intermediates in&#8197;situ provides direct access to complex bicyclic products with two quaternary and one tertiary stereogenic centers. The products may be further functionalized into valuable and enantiomerically highly enriched building blocks.

      <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro Olefins through C&#8722;H Functionalization and &#946;&#8208;fluoride Elimination Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Putting the F into Functionalization: &#946;&#8208;Fluoro elimination opens up pathways to introduce aryl&#8208;difluorovinyl groups onto indole heterocycles. By using a simple Pd catalyst, gem&#8208;difluoro olefins can now be prepared in a simple and straightforward fashion.







Abstract
A palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and consecutive &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination reaction between indole heterocycles and fluorinated diazoalkanes is reported. This approach provides for the first time a facile method for the rapid synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoro olefins using fluorinated diazoalkanes under mild reaction conditions. Cyclopropanation products were obtained when N&#8208;arylated rather than N&#8208;alkylated indoles were applied in this reaction. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of the &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination step in this transformation. This method presents a new concept for the simple and direct transfer of a 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl) group to access gem&#8208;difluoro olefins.

      <title>Genomic Encryption of Digital Data Stored in Synthetic DNA
</title>
      <dc:description>
It&#8242;s in your DNA: Inherited features from an individual&#8242;s genome are used as an encryption key to protect digital data stored in synthetic DNA. Although the encryption key and cyphertext originate from very different sources, the chemical nature of the information is identical and can consequently be analyzed with the same reading technology.







Abstract
Today, we can read human genomes and store digital data robustly in synthetic DNA. Herein, we report a strategy to intertwine these two technologies to enable the secure storage of valuable information in synthetic DNA, protected with personalized keys. We show that genetic short tandem repeats (STRs) contain sufficient entropy to generate strong encryption keys, and that only one technology, DNA sequencing, is required to simultaneously read the key and the data. Using this approach, we experimentally generated 80&#8197;bit strong keys from human DNA, and used such a key to encrypt 17&#8197;kB of digital information stored in synthetic DNA. Finally, the decrypted information was recovered perfectly from a single massively parallel sequencing run.

      <title>Enhancing the Acceptor Character of Conjugated Organoborane Macrocycles: A Highly Electron&#8208;Deficient Hexaboracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
B to B: Short phenylene linkers and strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated mesityl groups render the title compound highly electron&#8208;deficient yet air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable. Cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations reveal strong electronic communication between the six boron atoms through a very low&#8208;lying LUMO. Unique optical, electronic, and anion&#8208;binding properties are further substantiated by comparisons with linear oligomers.







Abstract
We introduce a new boron&#8208;doped cyclophane, the hexabora[16]cyclophane B6&#8208;FMes, in which six tricoordinate borane moieties alternate with short conjugated p&#8208;phenylene linkers. Exocyclic 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (FMes) groups serve not only to further withdraw electron density but at the same time sterically shield the boron atoms, resulting in a macrocycle that is both highly electron&#8208;deficient and stable. The optical and electronic properties are compared with those of related linear oligomers and the electronic structure is further evaluated by computational methods. The studies uncover unique properties of B6&#8208;FMes, including a low&#8208;lying and extensively delocalized LUMO and a wide HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which arise from the combination of a cyclic &#960;&#8208;system, strong electronic communication between the closely spaced borons, and the attachment of electron&#8208;deficient pendent groups. The binding of small anions to the electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and molecular model compounds is investigated and emissive exciplexes are detected in aromatic solvents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;B to B&lt;/b&gt;: Short phenylene linkers and strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated mesityl groups render the title compound highly electron&#8208;deficient yet air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable. Cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations reveal strong electronic communication between the six boron atoms through a very low&#8208;lying LUMO. Unique optical, electronic, and anion&#8208;binding properties are further substantiated by comparisons with linear oligomers.

Abstract
The synthesis of silacycles is highly appealing due to their important applications in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials chemistry. However, sila&#8208;tetralins and sila&#8208;benzosuberanes are surprisingly under&#8208;represented due to a lack of general methods to access these compounds.

      <title>The Limited Predictive Power of the Pauling Rules
</title>
      <dc:description>
Exceptions to the rules: The statistical analysis of the five Pauling rules reveals their limited predictive power. Each of the Pauling rules is tested on a set of 5000 experimentally known oxides. Their limits in terms of chemistries and structures are discussed in detail. Only 13&#8201;% of all tested structures fulfil the last four rules simultaneously.







Abstract
The Pauling rules have been used for decades to rationalise the crystal structures of ionic compounds. Despite their importance, there has been no statistical assessment of the performances of these five empirical rules so far. Here, we rigorously and automatically test all five Pauling rules for a large data set of around 5000 known oxides. We discuss each Pauling rule separately, stressing their limits and range of application in terms of chemistries and structures. We conclude that only 13&#8201;% of the oxides simultaneously satisfy the last four rules, indicating a much lower predictive power than expected.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis of Asymmetric [2+2] Cycloaddition in Cage&#8208;Confined Nanospace Merging Chirality with Triplet&#8208;State Photosensitization</title>
      <dc:description>
Control freak: A photoactive homochiral metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) promoted the stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of an acenaphthylene derivative in a supramolecular catalytic sense under sustainable conditions (see picture). The high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity resulted from preorganization of the substrates by the supramolecular cage, stereochemical control of the triplet state, and nanospace transfer of energy and chirality.







Abstract
Although the photodimerization of acenaphthylene (ACE) has been known for 100&#8197;years, the asymmetric cycloaddition of its 1&#8208;substituted derivatives is unknown. Herein, we report a supramolecular photochirogenic approach in which a homochiral and photoactive &#916;/&#923;&#8208;[Pd6(RuL3)8]28+ metal&#8211;organic cage (&#916;/&#923;&#8208;MOC&#8208;16) is used as a supramolecular reactor for the enantioselective exited&#8208;state photocatalysis of 1&#8208;Br&#8208;ACE. Owing to preorganization of the substrates by the supramolecular cage, stereochemical control of the triplet state, and nanospace transfer of energy and chirality, the cycloaddition of ACE proceeded with high selectivity for the formation of anti over syn stereoisomers, whereas the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective cycloaddition of unsymmetrical 1&#8208;Br&#8208;ACE showed effective enantiodifferentiation of a pair of anti head&#8208;to&#8208;head stereoisomers. The enzyme&#8208;mimicking photocatalysis was verified by catalytic turnover, rate enhancement, and competing&#8208;guest inhibition experiments.

      <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Insertion of Carbonyl Substrates into Cu&#8208;H: Different Rate&#8208;Limiting Steps as a Function of Electrophilicity</title>
      <dc:description>
Kinetic and mechanistic studies on insertion reactions of [(NHC)Cu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 complexes with carbonyl substrates show that the insertion of an aldehyde, ketone, activated ester/amide, or unactivated amide into the Cu&#8722;H bond consists of two different rate limiting steps: the formation of Cu&#8208;H monomer from Cu&#8208;H dimer for more electrophilic substrates, and hydride transfer from a transient Cu&#8208;H monomer for less electrophilic substrates.







Abstract
We report mechanistic studies on the insertion reactions of [(NHC)Cu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 complexes with carbonyl substrates by UV&#8208;vis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic kinetic studies, H/D isotopic labelling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results of these comprehensive studies show that the insertion of Cu&#8208;H with an aldehyde, ketone, activated ester/amide, and unactivated amide consist of two different rate limiting steps: the formation of Cu&#8208;H monomer from Cu&#8208;H dimer for more electrophilic substrates, and hydride transfer from a transient Cu&#8208;H monomer for less electrophilic substrates. We also report spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of rare Cu&#8208;hemiacetalate and Cu&#8208;hemiaminalate moieties from the insertion of an ester or amide into the Cu&#8722;H bond.

      <title>Coverage&#8208;Controlled Superstructures of C3&#8208;Symmetric Molecules: Honeycomb versus Hexagonal Tiling</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular honeycomb superstructures were investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy, covering nearly mesoscopic areas and with unit cells containing up to 3000 molecules. A fairly general model was developed that describes the energetics of such structures and show that their sizes can be controlled by coverage.







Abstract
The competition between honeycomb and hexagonal tiling of molecular units can lead to large honeycomb superstructures on surfaces. Such superstructures exhibit pores that may be used as 2D templates for functional guest molecules. Honeycomb superstructures of molecules that comprise a C3 symmetric platform on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces are presented. The superstructures cover nearly mesoscopic areas with unit cells containing up to 3000 molecules, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The unit cell size may be controlled by the coverage. A fairly general model was developed to describe the energetics of honeycomb superstructures built from C3 symmetric units. Based on three parameters that characterize two competing bonding arrangements, the model is consistent with the present experimental data and also reproduces various published results. The model identifies the relevant driving force, mostly related to geometric aspects, of the pattern formation.

      <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Propargylic Amines and CO2 Catalyzed by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free [Zn116] Nanocages</title>
      <dc:description>
A lantern&#8208;like [Zn116] cage consisting of six [Zn14O21] and eight [Zn4O4] clusters represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity nanocage assembled by Zn&#8208;clusters to date. It is the first eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst for the cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2.







Abstract
The reaction of propargylic amines and CO2 can provide high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical products. However, most of catalysts in such reactions employ noble metals to obtain high yield, and it is important to seek eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs catalysts. Here, a giant and lantern&#8208;like [Zn116] nanocage in zinc&#8208;tetrazole 3D framework [Zn22(Trz)8(OH)12(H2O)9&#8901;8&#8201;H2O]n Trz=(C4N12O)4&#8722; (1) was obtained and structurally characterized. It consists of six [Zn14O21] clusters and eight [Zn4O4] clusters. To our knowledge, this is the highest&#8208;nuclearity nanocages constructed by Zn&#8208;clusters as building blocks to date. Importantly, catalytic investigations reveal that 1 can efficiently catalyze the cycloaddition of propargylic amines with CO2, exclusively affording various 2&#8208;oxazolidinones under mild conditions. It is the first eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs catalyst for the cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2. DFT calculations uncover that ZnII ions can efficiently activate both C&#8801;C bonds of propargylic amines and CO2 by coordination interaction. NMR and FTIR spectroscopy further prove that Zn&#8208;clusters play an important role in activating C&#8801;C bonds of propargylic amines. Furthermore, the electronic properties of related reactants, intermediates and products can help to understand the basic reaction mechanism and crucial role of catalyst 1.

      <title>Water Triggers Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Network Reshaping in the Glycoaldehyde Dimer</title>
      <dc:description>
1&#8208;2&#8208;3, leave the structure be: Broadband rotational spectroscopy reveals the structure and hydrogen&#8208;bond networks of the glycoaldehyde dimer upon interaction with water. The structure of the isolated dimer changes upon addition of a single water molecule, while further addition of one or two water molecules does not significantly alter the hydrogen&#8208;bond network observed for the monohydrate.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are ubiquitous biomolecules in nature. The vast majority of their biomolecular activity takes place in aqueous environments. Molecular reactivity and functionality are, therefore, often strongly influenced by not only interactions with equivalent counterparts, but also with the surrounding water molecules. Glycoaldehyde (Gly) represents a prototypical system to identify the relevant interactions and the balance that governs them. Here we present a broadband rotational&#8208;spectroscopy study on the stepwise hydration of the Gly dimer with up to three water molecules. We reveal the preferred hydrogen&#8208;bond networks formed when water molecules sequentially bond to the sugar dimer. We observe that the dimer structure and the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks at play remarkably change upon the addition of just a single water molecule to the dimer. Further addition of water molecules does not significantly alter the observed hydrogen&#8208;bond topologies.

      <title>Indirect and Direct Grafting of Transition Metals to Siliconoids</title>
      <dc:description>
The first siliconoids containing directly bonded transition&#8208;metal fragments are readily accessible from ligato&#8208;lithiated Si6 siliconoids and dichlorometallocenes (M=Zr, Hf). Charge&#8208;neutral siliconoid ligands were obtained by introduction of a pending tetrylene functionality (E=Si, Ge, Sn). The corresponding Fe(CO)4 complexes were synthesized for proof of concept (silicon atoms shown as pink circles).







Abstract
Unsaturated charge&#8208;neutral silicon clusters (siliconoids) are important as gas&#8208;phase intermediates between molecules and the elemental bulk. With stable zirconocene&#8208; and hafnocene&#8208;substituted derivatives, we here report the first examples containing directly bonded transition&#8208;metal fragments that are readily accessible from the ligato&#8208;lithiated Si6 siliconoid (1Li) and Cp2MCl2 (M=Zr, Hf). Charge&#8208;neutral siliconoid ligands with pending tetrylene functionality were prepared by the reaction of amidinato chloro tetrylenes [PhC(NtBu)2]ECl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) with 1Li, thus confirming the principal compatibility of such low&#8208;valent functionalities with the unsaturated Si6 cluster scaffold. The pronounced donor properties of the tetrylene/siliconoid hybrids allow for their coordination to the Fe(CO)4 fragment.

      <title>Electroactive Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks as Emitters for Self&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence in Aqueous Medium</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have limited applications in electrochemical fields due to their poor conductivity. In this work, an electroactive MOF (E&#8208;MOF) is designed as a highly crystallized electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitter in aqueous medium for the first time. The E&#8208;MOF contains mixed&#8208;ligands of hydroquinone and phenanthroline as oxidative and reductive couples, respectively. Interestingly, E&#8208;MOFs demonstrate excellent performance with surface state model in both co&#8208;reactant and annihilation ECL in aqueous medium. Compared with the individual components, E&#8208;MOFs significantly improve the ECL emission due to the framework structure. More importantly, the self&#8208;enhanced ECL emission with high stability is realized by the accumulation of MOF&#8217;s cation radicals via pre&#8208;reduction electrolysis. The self&#8208;enhanced mechanism is theoretically identified by density functional theory. The mixed&#8208;ligand E&#8208;MOFs provide a proof of concept using molecular crystalline materials as new ECL emitters for fundamental mechanism studies, and broadens their applications in long&#8208;term ECL assays.</dc:description>

      <title>Pre&#8208;targeted Imaging of Protease Activity through In&#8197;Situ Assembly of Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Double click imaging: A pre&#8208;targeting approach for imaging enzyme activity in&#8197;vivo based on target&#8208;enabled in&#8197;situ ligand aggregation (TESLA) is presented. The small molecule is first activated by the target enzyme to trigger macrocyclization and nanoaggregation in cells, followed by bioorthogonal click labeling with a fluorescent dye or radionuclide to generate imaging contrast.







Abstract
The pre&#8208;targeted imaging of enzyme activity has not been reported, likely owing to the lack of a mechanism to retain the injected substrate in the first step for subsequent labeling. Herein, we report the use of two bioorthogonal reactions&#8212;the condensation reaction of aromatic nitriles and aminothiols and the inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8212;to develop a novel strategy for pre&#8208;targeted imaging of the activity of proteases. The substrate probe (TCO&#8208;C&#8208;SNAT4) can be selectively activated by an enzyme target (e.g. caspase&#8208;3/7), which triggers macrocyclization and subsequent in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly into nanoaggregates retained at the target site. The tetrazine&#8208;imaging tag conjugate labels TCO in the nanoaggregates to generate selective signal retention for imaging in&#8197;vitro, in cells, and in mice. Owing to the decoupling of enzyme activation and imaging tag immobilization, TCO&#8208;C&#8208;SNAT4 can be repeatedly injected to generate and accumulate more TCO&#8208;nanoaggregates for click labeling.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymer Synthesized via Interfacial Suzuki Reaction toward Electronic Device Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Preparing two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2DCPs) with desirable conjugated structures and semiconducting properties is promising but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an efficient synthesis of a new 2DCP, named as 2D polytriethyltriindole (2DPTTI)  via  a modified interfacial Suzuki reaction from 2,7,12&#8208;tribromo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triethyltriindole (2&#8208;BrTTI) and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid dipinacol ester (BADE) precursors under room temperature. Wafer&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing 2DPTTI films with controllable thickness of 2.5&#8208;46.0 nm were obtained by adjusting the experimental conditions. The resulted 2DPTTI films used as active layer in organic field effect transistors (OFETs) exhibited typical p&#8208;type semiconducting electrical transporting property, and superior UV optoelectronic performances with photosensitivity of 3.7 x 10  3  and responsivity of 1.4 x 10  3  A W  &#8208;1  under 380 nm light irradiation.

      <title>Coordination Tunes Selectivity: Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction on High&#8208;Loading Molybdenum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in electrocatalysis. Their performance can be rationally optimized by tailoring the center metal atoms, adjacent coordinative dopants, and metal loading. However, it is still of great challenge due to the limited synthesis approach and insufficient understanding of the structure&#8208;property relation. Herein, we reported a new kind of Mo SAC with a unique O, S&#8208;dual coordination and a high metal loading over 10 wt%. The isolation feature and local environment was identified by high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The obtained SACs can catalyze oxygen reduction reaction via 2e&#8211; pathway with a high H2O2 selectivity above 95% in 0.10 M KOH. The critical role of Mo single atoms and the coordination structure was revealed by both electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. This work enriches the family of SACs and highlights the importance of local coordination, thus rendering new opportunities to tune the activity and selectivity in multi&#8208;electron electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Recognition and Stabilization of Unsaturated Fatty Acids by a Polyaromatic Receptor</title>
      <dc:description>Selective recognition of natural fatty acids is intrinsically difficult owing to the long, flexible, and poorly interactive hydrocarbon chains.

      <title>Peripheral RAFT polymerization on covalent organic polymer with enhanced aqueous compatibility for controlled generation of singlet oxygen</title>
      <dc:description>The efficient generation of singlet oxygen has attracted a great deal of interest in various fields such as medicine, synthetic chemistry and materials science. In this study, a covalent organic polymer (COP) is prepared by crosslinking the photosensitizer 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline (TAPP) with 4,4'&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)dibenzoic acid (ADDA) via the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)/4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) coupling method. The COP is further modified with a hydrophilic polymer i.e. poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) through grafting&#8208;from reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to enhance its solubility in various solvent systems. The modified COP can bind with singlet oxygen through the formation of endoperoxide by ADDA upon the exposure to the red light irradiation. The singlet oxygen incorporated in COP can be then released via the photodynamic mechanism or the cycloreversion by endoperoxide when heated at 110 &#176;C. Our results have opened new possibilities for simultaneous generation of singlet oxygen by the dual mechanisms, i.e. photodynamic route and singlet oxygen carrier, which demonstrates the promising potential for treating hypoxic tumors.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Artificial Supramolecular Light&#8208;Harvesting System for Imaging in Golgi Apparatus</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;harvesting system is an important way for capturing, transferring and utilizing light energy, while it remains a key challenge to develop highly efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Herein, we report a supramolecular co&#8208;assembly based on lower&#8208;rim dodecyl&#8208;modified sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD) and naphthyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diphenyl pyridinium derivative (NPS) as a light&#8208;harvesting platform. NPS as a donor shows significant aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE) after assembling with SC4AD. Upon introduction of Nile blue (NiB) as an acceptor into the NPS&#8208;SC4AD co&#8208;assembly, the light&#8208;harvesting system becomes near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive (675 nm). Importantly, the NIR emitting NPS&#8208;SC4AD&#8208;NiB system exhibits an ultrahigh antenna effect (33.1) at a high donor/acceptor ratio (250:1). By co&#8208;staining PC&#8208;3 cells with a Golgi staining reagent, NBD C6&#8208;ceramide, NIR imaging in Golgi apparatus has been demonstrated using these NIR emissive nanoparticles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Controlling the surface composition of shaped bimetallic nanoparticles could offer precise tunability of geometric and electronic surface structure for new nanocatalysts. To achieve this goal, we design a platform for studying the intermixing process in a shaped nanoparticle, using multilayered Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;Pt core&#8208;shell nanocubes as precursors. We find that, under mild conditions, the intermixing between Ni and Pt could be tuned by changing layer thickness and number, triggering intermixing while preserving nanoparticle shape. Intermixing of the two metals is monitored using transmission electron microscopy. The surface structure evolution is characterized using electrochemical methanol oxidation. DFT calculations suggest that the low&#8208;temperature mixing is enhanced by shorter diffusion lengths and strain introduced by the layered structure. The platform and insights presented here represent an advance toward the realization of shape&#8208;controlled multimetallic nanoparticles tailored to each potential application.</dc:description>

      <title>Interplay of Electronic and Steric Effects to Yield Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation at Metal Single Sites in Defect&#8208;Engineered HKUST&#8208;1</title>
      <dc:description>In contrast to catalytically active metal single atoms deposited on oxide nanoparticles, the crystalline nature of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) allows for a thorough characterization of reactions mechanisms. Using defect&#8208;free HKUST&#8208;1 MOF thin films, we demonstrate that Cu  +  /Cu  2+  dimer defects, created in a controlled fashion by reducing the pristine Cu  2+  /Cu  2+  pairs of the intact framework, account for the high catalytic activity in low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation. Combining in&#8208;situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory we propose a new reaction mechanism where the key intermediate is an uncharged O  2  species, weakly bound to Cu  +  /Cu  2+  . Our results reveal a complex interplay between electronic and steric effects at defect sites in MOFs and provide important guidelines for tailoring and exploiting the catalytic activity of single metal atom sites.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Proteins for Engineering Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
In a material world: A simple and versatile strategy for assembling functional materials was established through the interfacial assembly of proteins and polyphenols on various substrates. Protein&#8211;polyphenol capsules were used to elucidate the dominant interaction(s) between different proteins and polyphenols. The assembled proteins retain their structure and function, thereby enabling their use in various applications, for example, biocatalysis or cell targeting.







Abstract
Functional materials composed of proteins have attracted much interest owing to the inherent and diverse functionality of proteins. However, establishing general techniques for assembling proteins into nanomaterials is challenging owing to the complex physicochemical nature and potential denaturation of proteins. Here, a simple, versatile strategy is introduced to fabricate functional protein assemblies through the interfacial assembly of proteins and polyphenols (e.g., tannic acid) on various substrates (organic, inorganic, and biological). The dominant interactions (hydrogen&#8208;bonding, hydrophobic, and ionic) between the proteins and tannic acid were elucidated; most proteins undergo multiple noncovalent stabilizing interactions with polyphenols, which can be used to engineer responsiveness into the assemblies. The proteins retain their structure and function within the assemblies, thereby enabling their use in various applications (e.g., catalysis, fluorescence imaging, and cell targeting).

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light Triggered&#8208;Release in Deep Brain Regions Using Ultra&#8208;photosensitive Nanovesicles</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;photosensitive nanovesicles are developed by coating gold shell on the surface of mechanoresponsive nanovesicles. Gold shell transduces near&#8208;infrared laser pulses to nanomechanical force, leading to efficent cargo release in sub&#8208;seconds. This high photosensitivity enables photorelease of molecules down to a depth of 4&#8197;mm in mouse brain.







Abstract
Remote and minimally&#8208;invasive modulation of biological systems with light has transformed modern biology and neuroscience. However, light absorption and scattering significantly prevents penetration to deep brain regions. Herein, we describe the use of gold&#8208;coated mechanoresponsive nanovesicles, which consist of liposomes made from the artificial phospholipid Rad&#8208;PC&#8208;Rad as a tool for the delivery of bioactive molecules into brain tissue. Near&#8208;infrared picosecond laser pulses activated the gold&#8208;coating on the surface of nanovesicles, creating nanomechanical stress and leading to near&#8208;complete vesicle cargo release in sub&#8208;seconds. Compared to natural phospholipid liposomes, the photo&#8208;release was possible at 40 times lower laser energy. This high photosensitivity enables photorelease of molecules down to a depth of 4&#8197;mm in mouse brain. This promising tool provides a versatile platform to optically release functional molecules to modulate brain circuits.

Ringing off the hook: The shimalactone biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and investigated. Expression of the ShmA polyketide synthase in A. oryzae resulted in production of preshimalactone. A. oryzae and S. cerevisiae transformants expressing ShmA and ShmB produced shimalactones&#8197;A and B, thus suggesting that the double bicyclo&#8208;ring formation reactions proceed non&#8208;enzymatically from the preshimalactone epoxide, and this was supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Shimalactones&#8197;A and B are neuritogenic polyketides possessing characteristic oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene ring systems that are produced by the marine fungus Emericella variecolor GF10. We identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster and conducted heterologous expression analysis. Expression of ShmA polyketide synthase in Aspergillus oryzae resulted in the production of preshimalactone. Aspergillus oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants expressing ShmA and ShmB produced shimalactones&#8197;A and B, thus suggesting that the double bicyclo&#8208;ring formation reactions proceed non&#8208;enzymatically from preshimalactone epoxide. DFT calculations strongly support the idea that oxabicyclo&#8208;ring formation and 8&#960;&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization proceed spontaneously after opening of the preshimalactone epoxide ring through protonation. We confirmed the formation of preshimalactone epoxide in&#8197;vitro, followed by its non&#8208;enzymatic conversion to shimalactones in the dark.

      <title>Facile and Versatile Synthesis of End&#8208;Functionalized Poly(phenylacetylene)s: A Multicomponent Catalytic System for Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes</title>
      <dc:description>
All's well that ends well: Various end&#8208;functionalized poly(phenylacetylene)s have been synthesized by polymerization using a multicomponent catalytic system composed of readily available and bench&#8208;stable reagents (see picture). Owing to the high reactivity and living nature of the polymerization, which has a high initiation efficiency (IE), the molecular weight of the obtained poly(phenylacetylene)s could be readily controlled with a very narrow polydispersity index (PDI).







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system for well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of phenylacetylenes has been developed. The catalytic system is composed of readily available and bench&#8208;stable [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, aryl boronic acid derivatives, diphenylacetylene, 50&#8201;% aqueous KOH, and PPh3. This system offers a method for the facile and versatile synthesis of various end&#8208;functionalized cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s because components from aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylene were introduced to the initiating end of the polymers. The polymerization reaction shows a typical living nature with a high initiation efficiency, and the molecular weight of the resulting poly(phenylacetylene)s can be readily controlled with very narrow molecular&#8208;weight distributions (Mw/Mn=1.02&#8211;1.09). The experimental results suggest that the present catalytic system has a higher polymerization activity than the polymerization activities of other rhodium&#8208;based catalytic systems previously reported.

      <title>Imino&#8208; and azasugar protonation inside human acid &#946;&#8208;glucosidase, the enzyme defective in Gaucher disease</title>
      <dc:description>Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in human acid &#946;&#8208;glucosidase, the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of glucosyl ceramide in the lysosomes. Imino&#8208; and azasugars such as 1&#8208;deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine are strong inhibitors of the enzyme and of interest in pharmacological chaperone therapy of the disease. Despite several crystal structures of the enzyme with the imino&#8208; and azasugars bound in the active site having been resolved, the actual acid&#8208;base chemistry of the binding is not known. In this study we show, using photoinduced electron transfer (PET), that 1&#8208;deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine derivatives are protonated by human acid &#946;&#8208;glucosidase when bound even if completely unprotonated outside the enzyme. While isofagomine derivative protonation to some degree was foreshadowed by earlier crystal structures, 1&#8208;deoxynojirimycin derivatives were not believed to act as basic amines in the enzyme.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8722;B Bond Nucleophilicity in a Tetraaryl &#956;&#8208;Hydridodiborane(4) Anion</title>
      <dc:description>
Happy divorce: The hydride adduct of a tetraaryl diborane(4) has been shown to possess a nucleophilic B&#8722;B bond. Upon heterolysis, a diaryl boryl anion is released, which can act as a boron&#8208;centered nucleophile or undergo [4+1] cycloaddition reactions to furnish spiroborates.







Abstract
The tetraaryl &#956;&#8208;hydridodiborane(4) anion [2H]&#8722; possesses nucleophilic B&#8722;B and B&#8722;H bonds. Treatment of K[2H] with the electrophilic 9&#8208;H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene (HBFlu) furnishes the B3 cluster K[3], with a triangular boron core linked through two BHB two&#8208;electron, three&#8208;center bonds and one electron&#8208;precise B&#8722;B bond, reminiscent of the prominent [B3H8]&#8722; anion. Upon heating or prolonged stirring at room temperature, K[3] rearranges to a slightly more stable isomer K[3&#8201;a]. The reaction of M[2H] (M+=Li+, K+) with MeI or Me3SiCl leads to equimolar amounts of 9&#8208;R&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene and HBFlu (R=Me or Me3Si). Thus, [2H]&#8722; behaves as a masked [:BFlu]&#8722; nucleophile. The HBFlu by&#8208;product was used in&#8197;situ to establish a tandem substitution&#8208;hydroboration reaction: a 1:1 mixture of M[2H] and allyl bromide gave the 1,3&#8208;propylene&#8208;linked ditopic 9&#8208;borafluorene 5 as sole product. M[2H] also participates in unprecedented [4+1] cycloadditions with dienes to furnish dialkyl diaryl spiroborates, M[R2BFlu].

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Boronate Ester Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Large Single Crystalline Domains for a Neuromorphic Memory Device</title>
      <dc:description>
Mimicking synaptic plasticity: A free&#8208;standing boronate ester&#8208;linked 2D COF thin film has been achieved with record crystalline domain size as large as &#8776;60&#8197;&#956;m2 via an interfacial synthesis method. This film was integrated into an organic thin film/Si nanowire&#8208;based field effect transistor to mimic neuronal synapses capable of learning&#8211;erasing&#8211;forgetting memory process.







Abstract
Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of crystalline boronate ester covalent organic frameworks (BECOFs) in powder and thin&#8208;film through solvothermal method and on&#8208;solid&#8208;surface synthesis, respectively, their applications in electronics, remain less explored due to the challenges in thin&#8208;film processability and device integration associated with the control of film thickness, layer orientation, stability and crystallinity. Moreover, although the crystalline domain sizes of the powder samples can reach micrometer scale (up to &#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;m), the reported thin&#8208;film samples have so far rather small crystalline domains up to 100&#8197;nm. Here we demonstrate a general and efficient synthesis of crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BECOF films composed of porphyrin macrocycles and phenyl or naphthyl linkers (named as 2D BECOF&#8208;PP or 2D BECOF&#8208;PN) by employing a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) on the water surface. The achieved 2D BECOF&#8208;PP is featured as free&#8208;standing thin film with large single&#8208;crystalline domains up to &#8776;60&#8197;&#956;m2 and tunable thickness from 6 to 16&#8197;nm. A hybrid memory device composed of 2D BECOF&#8208;PP film on silicon nanowire&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor is demonstrated as a bio&#8208;inspired system to mimic neuronal synapses, displaying a learning&#8211;erasing&#8211;forgetting memory process.

A hybrid memory device composed of 2D BECOF&#8208;PP film on silicon nanowire&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor is demonstrated as a bio&#8208;inspired system to mimic neuronal synapses, displaying a learning&#8211;erasing&#8211;forgetting memory process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zeise, Liebig, Jensen, H&#252;ckel, Dewar, and the Olefin &#960;&#8208;Complex Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
The first organometallic compounds, now known to be platinum &#960;&#8208;complexes, were discovered in 1825&#8211;1830 by Zeise. This discovery sparked a controversy between Liebig, Dumas, Berzelius, and W&#246;hler. In discussions with Jensen in the 1930s, H&#252;ckel still believed that the compounds arose from simple addition to the ethylene double bond. It was not until 1951 that Dewar formulated the MO description of the bonding in transition&#8208;metal &#960;&#8208;complexes.







Abstract
Zeise's salt, KPt(C2H4)Cl3, was the first characterized organometallic compound; it was also the first olefin &#960;&#8208;complex. It was published in 1825&#8211;1830 in the middle of a fight between Dumas on the one hand and Berzelius and Liebig on the other, who defended the etherin (ethylene) and radical theories, respectively. Although Zeise's formulation as a compound containing ethylene was vindicated, the fight went on for many years. This was a time when the theories of organic chemistry were being developed, before any clear understanding of the nature of molecules, bonding, and structure. Zeise thought of the structure of his salt as a product of the addition of PtCl2 to ethylene. Jensen assumed a central bonding to ethylene but needed theoretical assistance to explain it. His attempt to obtain such an explanation from H&#252;ckel failed, and it was Dewar who explained the nature of &#960;&#8208;complexes in molecular orbital terms in 1951.

      <title>Preparative Mass Spectrometry Using a Rotating&#8208;Wall Mass Analyzer</title>
      <dc:description>
You spin me round: Preparative mass spectrometry using a rotating&#8208;wall mass analyzer enables the deposition of well&#8208;defined polyatomic ions from small molecules to nanoclusters and protein complexes as well as the high&#8208;throughput separation and deposition of molecules from multicomponent mixtures. The approach is of interest to the design and preparation of functional interfaces and uses an inexpensive and compact instrumentation.







Abstract
The design of functional interfaces is central to both fundamental and applied research in materials science and energy technology. We introduce a new, broadly applicable technique for the precisely controlled high&#8208;throughput preparation of well&#8208;defined interfaces containing polyatomic species ranging from small ions to nanocrystals and large protein complexes. The mass&#8208;dispersive deposition of ions onto surfaces is achieved using a rotating&#8208;wall mass analyzer, a compact device which enables the separation of ions using low voltages and has a theoretically unlimited mass range. We demonstrate an efficient deposition of singly charged Au144(SC4H9)60 ions (33.7&#8197;kDa), which opens up exciting opportunities for the structural characterization of nanocrystals and their assemblies using transmission electron microscopy. Our approach also enables the high&#8208;throughput deposition of mass&#8208;selected ions from multicomponent mixtures, which is of interest to the controlled preparation of surface gradients and rapid screening of molecules in mixtures for a specific property.

</title>
      <dc:description>
A matter of form: Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is based on the use of controlled/living polymerization (CLP) and consists of extending solvophilic living chains with a solvophobic segment to generate block copolymers that self&#8208;assemble to achieve various morphologies in&#8197;situ. This Review covers PISA mediated by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), one of the most popular radical CLP methods.







Abstract
After a brief history that positions polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in the field of polymer chemistry, this Review will cover the fundamentals of the PISA mechanism. Furthermore, this Review will also give an overview of some of the features and limitations of RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in terms of the choice of the components involved, the nature of the nanoobjects that can be obtained and how the syntheses can be controlled, as well as some potential applications.

      <title>Genome Mining of Oxidation Modules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Synthases Reveals a Culturable Source for Lobatamides</title>
      <dc:description>
O where art thou: In the classic model for modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), a small set of reactions generate combinatorially substituted carbon chains. Architecturally diverse PKS modules were identified that diversify polyketides by oxygenation. An orphan PKS with two oxygenase modules from a plant symbiont was found to produce lobatamides, which are in&#8208;chain&#8208;oxygenated oxime&#8208;bearing cytotoxins that were previously only known from a tunicate.







Abstract
Bacterial trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are multimodular megaenzymes that biosynthesize many bioactive natural products. They contain a remarkable range of domains and module types that introduce different substituents into growing polyketide chains. As one such modification, we recently reported Baeyer&#8211;Villiger&#8208;type oxygen insertion into nascent polyketide backbones, thereby generating malonyl thioester intermediates. In this work, genome mining focusing on architecturally diverse oxidation modules in trans&#8208;AT PKSs led us to the culturable plant symbiont Gynuella sunshinyii, which harbors two distinct modules in one orphan PKS. The PKS product was revealed to be lobatamide A, a potent cytotoxin previously only known from a marine tunicate. Biochemical studies show that one module generates glycolyl thioester intermediates, while the other is proposed to be involved in oxime formation. The data suggest varied roles of oxygenation modules in the biosynthesis of polyketide scaffolds and support the importance of trans&#8208;AT PKSs in the specialized metabolism of symbiotic bacteria.

      <title>An electrochemophysiological microarray for real&#8208;time tracking and quantifying of multi&#8208;ions in the brain of freely moving rat</title>
      <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantification of multiple neurochemicals, together with recording of electrical signals in a live brain has long been a prominent challenge. Here, we created an electrochemophysiological microarray (ECPM) for real&#8208;time mapping and simultaneous quantification of chemical signals for multiple ions in the deep brain of freely moving rat, in which selective and accurate microelectrode arrays were developed for direct determination of K  +  , Ca  2+  , Na  +  and pH using open&#8208;circuit potentiometry. Specific recognition ionophores were synthesized and optimized for determination of K  +  , Ca  2+  , Na  +  and pH. An inner&#8208;reference electrode was also developed to provide a built&#8208;in correction for avoiding interferences in the complicated brain. The developed microarrays demonstrating high accuracy and selectivity were successfully applied in real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantification of multi&#8208;ions in a live brain. The extra current&#8208;free potentiometry allowed mapping and biosensing of chemical signals, together with recording of electrical signals in the whole brain without cross&#8208;talk, for the first time.

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkynylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Picobello: A picolinamide directing group enables a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of unactivated olefins. The transformation can proceed through both 6&#8208;endo&#8208; and 6&#8208;exo&#8208;alkenyl palladacycles to afford 1,3&#8208;enynes in good yield and high E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective C&#8722;H functionalization with bromoalkynes and electronically unbiased olefins is reported. The picolinamide directing group enables the formation of putative 5 and 6&#8208;exo&#8208;metallacycles as intermediates to afford monoalkynylated products in up to 91&#8201;% yield in a stereospecific fashion. The systematic study reveals that substrates with a wide range of substituents on the olefin and bromoalkyne coupling partners are tolerated. Chemoselective transformations were demonstrated for the obtained amides, olefins, and alkynes.

      <title>From C1 to C3: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed gem&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)olefination of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Esters with TMSCF3</title>
      <dc:description>
Chain growth: A copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot C1&#8208;to&#8208;C3 process enables the conversion of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters into 1,1&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)alkenes using TMSCF3 as the sole fluorocarbon source. The reaction proceeds at room temperature and is scalable.







Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)olefination of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters, using TMSCF3 as the only fluorocarbon source, has been developed and provides an exquisite method to access gem&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)alkenes. This unprecedented olefination process involves a carbene migratory insertion into &#8220;CuCF3&#8221; to generate the &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted organocopper species, which then undergoes &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination and two consecutive addition&#8208;elimination processes to give the desired products. The key to this efficient one&#8208;pot C1&#8208;to&#8208;C3 synthetic protocol lies in the controllable double (over single and triple) trifluoromethylations of the gem&#8208;difluoroalkene intermediates.

Abstract
Chiral 1,2&#8208;bimetallic reagents are useful motifs in synthetic chemistry. Although syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;bimetallic compounds can be prepared by alkene dimetallation, anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;bimetallics are still rare. The stereospecific 1,2&#8208;metallate shift that occurs during conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling is shown to enable a practical and modular approach to the catalytic synthesis of enantioenriched anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;borosilanes.

Abstract
We demonstrate that trimethylamine borane can exhibit desirable piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties. The material was shown to be able operate as a flexible film for both thermal sensing, thermal energy conversion and mechanical sensing with high open circuit voltages (&gt;10&#8197;V). A piezoelectric coefficient of d33&#8776;10&#8211;16&#8197;pC&#8201;N&#8722;1, and pyroelectric coefficient of p&#8776;25.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1 were achieved after poling, with high pyroelectric figure of merits for sensing and harvesting, along with a relative permittivity of

      <title>Active Electron Density Modulation of Co3O4&#8208;Based Catalysts Enhances their Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface enhancement: The surface electronic structure of Co3O4 can be effectively regulated, thereby leading to substantial enhancement of its oxygen evolution reaction performance.







Abstract
Despite the fact that many strategies have been developed to improve the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the precise modulation of the surface electronic properties of catalysts to improve their catalytic activity is still challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface active electron density of Co3O4 can be effectively regulated by an argon&#8208;ion irradiation method. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and synchrotron x&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, UV photoelectron spectrometry, and DFT calculations show that the surface active electron density band center of Co3O4 has been upshifted, leading to a significantly enhanced absorption capability of the oxo group. The optimized Co3O4&#8208;based catalysts exhibit an excellent overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 54&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, superior to the capability of the benchmark RuO2, representing one of the best Co&#8208;based OER catalysts. This approach could guide the future rational design and discovery of ideal electrocatalysts.

      <title>Direct Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from Nitric Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>NO removal from exhausted gas is necessary due to its damage to environment. Meanwhile, the electrochemical ammonia synthesis (EAS) from N  2  is suffering from a low reaction rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we propose an alternative route for ammonia synthesis from exhausted NO via electrocatalysis. Density functional theory calculations indicate electrochemical NO reduction (NORR) is more active than N  2  reduction (NRR). Via a descriptor&#8208;based approach, Cu was screened out to be the most active metal catalyst for NORR to NH  3  due to its moderate reactivity. Moreover, kinetic calculations reveal NH  3  is the most preferred product relative to H  2  , N  2  O and N  2  on Cu. Experimentally, a record&#8208;high EAS rate of 517.1 &#956;mol&#183;cm  &#8208;2  &#183;h  &#8208;1  and FE of 93.5% were achieved at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE using a Cu foam electrode, exhibiting stable electrocatalytic performances with 100 hours run.

Electrochemical intramolecular C&#8722;S bond formation leading to derivatives is achieved. Bromide catalytically promoted the reaction as a halogen mediator.







Abstract
The first electrochemical dehydrogenative C&#8722;S bond formation leading to thienoacene derivatives is described. Several thienoacene derivatives were synthesized by dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/S&#8722;H coupling. The addition of nBu4NBr, which catalytically promoted the reaction as a halogen mediator, was essential.

We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208;carbonylalkylarylation of vinylarenes with &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyl compounds and arylzinc reagents.

      <title>Vancomycin Resistance is Overcome by Conjugation of Polycationic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>Multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria represent one of the biggest challenges facing modern medicine. The development of resistances results in an exhaustion of the pool of antibacterial substances, mostly natural products that have been perfected by evolution to a dedicated target. The increasing prevalence of glycopeptide resistance compromises the efficacy of vancomycin, for a long time considered as the last resort for the treatment of resistant bacteria. In order to reestablish its activity, polycationic peptides were conjugated to vancomycin. By site&#8208;specific conjugation, derivatives that bear the peptide moiety at four different sites of the antibiotic were synthesized. The most potent compounds exhibited an approximately 1,000&#8208;fold increased antimicrobial activity and were able to overcome the most important types of vancomycin resistance. Additional blocking experiments using D&#8208;Ala&#8208;D&#8208;Ala revealed the prevalence of a mode of action beyond cell wall inhibition. As further highlight, the antimicrobial potential of the lead candidate FU002 for bacterial infection treatments could be demonstrated in an in vivo  efficacy study. Furthermore, molecular imaging and biodistribution studies revealed that conjugation engenders superior pharmacokinetics.

      <title>Light&#8208;driven Crawling of Molecular Crystals via Phase&#8208;dependent Transient Elastic Lattice Deformation</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we report the light&#8208;driven crawling of a molecular crystal that can form three phases, i.e., the &#945;, &#946;, and &#947; phases. We demonstrate that laser irradiation of the molecular crystal can generate phase&#8208;dependent  transient elastic lattice deformation  . The resulting elastic lattice deformation that follows scanning irradiation of a laser can actuate the different phases of molecular crystal to move with different velocity and direction. Because the &#947; phase has a large Young&#8217;s modulus (ca. 26 GPa), a force of 0.1 &#956;N can be generated under one laser spot. The generated force is sufficient to actuate the &#947;&#8208;formed molecular crystals in a wide dimensional range to move longitudinally at a velocity of ca. 60 &#956;m min  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude faster than the &#945; and &#946; phases.</dc:description>

      <title>CO2&#8208;induced spin state switching at room temperature in a monomeric cobalt(II) complex with the porous nature</title>
      <dc:description>The first example of CO 2  &#8208;responsive spin state conversion between high&#8208;spin (HS) and low&#8208;spin (LS) states at room temperature was achieved in a monomeric cobalt(II) complex. A neutral cobalt(II) complex, [Co II  (COO&#8208;terpy) 2  ]&#183;4H 2  O ( 1&#183;4H 2  O  ), stably formed cavities generated via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking motifs and hydrogen bond networks, resulted in the accommodation of four water molecules. A crystalline 1&#183;4H 2  O  transformed to the solvent&#8208;free 1  without loss of the porosity by heating up to 420 K. Compound 1  exhibited a selective carbon dioxide (CO 2  ) adsorption via a gate&#8208;open type of the structural modification. Furthermore, the HS/LS transition temperature ( T  1/2  ) was able to be tuned by the CO 2  &#8208;pressure over a wide temperature range. Unlike 1  exhibits the HS state at 290 K, the CO 2  &#8208;accomodated form 1&#8835;CO 2  ( P  CO2  = 110 kPa) was stabilized in the LS state at 290 K probably caused by &#8220;chemical pressure&#8221; effect by CO 2  accommodation, which provides reversible spin&#8208;state conversion by introducing/evacuating CO 2  gas into/from 1  . This result represents an important advance providing new insights for the development of new gas&#8208;responsive functional magnetic materials in the future.</dc:description>

      <title>Hidden isolated OH at the charged hydrophobic interface revealed by two&#8208;dimensional heterodyne&#8208;detected VSFG spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Water around the hydrophobic groups mediates hydrophobic interaction that plays key roles in many chemical and biological processes. Thus, molecular&#8208;level elucidation of the properties of the water in the vicinity of the hydrophobic group is important. We report on the structure and dynamics of water at two oppositely charged hydrophobic ion/water interfaces, i.e. the tetraphenylborate ion (TPB  &#8208;  )/water and tetraphenylarsonium ion (TPA  +  )/water interfaces, which are clarified by two&#8208;dimensional heterodyne&#8208;detected vibrational sum frequency generation (2D HD&#8208;VSFG) spectroscopy. The obtained 2D HD&#8208;VSFG spectra of anionic TPB  &#8208;  interface reveal the existence of distinct &#960;&#8208;hydrogen bonded OH groups in addition to the usual hydrogen bonded OH groups, which is hidden in the steady&#8208;state spectrum. In contrast, 2D HD&#8208;VSFG spectra of cationic TPA  +  interface only show the presence of usual hydrogen bonded OH groups. The present study demonstrates that the sign of the interfacial charge governs the structure and dynamics of water molecules that face the hydrophobic region.</dc:description>

MIL&#8208;69(Al) NWs with an average diameter of 70 &#177; 20 nm and lengths up to 2 &#956;m were found to preferentially grow along the [001] crystallographic direction. Advanced characterization tools (electron diffraction, TEM, STEM&#8208;HAADF, SEM, XPS) and molecular modelling revealed the mechanism of formation of MIL&#8208;69(Al) NWs involving size&#8208;confinement and templating effects. The formation of MIL&#8208;69(Al) seeds and the self&#8208;scroll of GO sheets followed by the anisotropic growth of MIL&#8208;69(Al) crystals are mediated by specific GO sheets/MOF interactions.

      <title>Chromium Catalyzed Alkylation of Amines by Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>The alkylation of amines by alcohols is a broadly applicable, sustainable, and selective method for the synthesis of alkyl amines, which are important bulk and fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or agrochemicals. Here we report that Cr complexes can catalyze this C&#8208;N bond formation reaction. We synthesized and isolated 35 examples of alkylated amines. Thirteen previously undisclosed products could be obtained and the use of amino alcohols as alkylating agents could be demonstrated. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups, among them hydrogenation sensitive examples. In comparison to many other alcohol&#8208;based amine alkylation protocols where a stoichiometric amount of base is required, our Cr based catalyst system permits product isolation with yields higher than 90% for various alkyl amines with a catalytic amount of base only.

Subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation gave the corresponding quinoidal benzidine linked cyclophanes 1&#8208;N, 2&#8208;N and 3&#8208;N. Their geometries were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and their electronic properties were investigated by electronic absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The quinoidal benzidine&#8208;linked cyclophanes all show thermally populated paramagnetic activity with a relatively large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The structure&#8208;property relationship was discussed. Two enantiomers for the ortho&#8208; cyclophanes (1&#8208;NH and 1&#8208;N) were isolated by chiral HPLC and their chiral figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocyclic structures were identified by X&#8208;ray analysis and circular dichroism spectral measurements.

      <title>Unexpected Chromophore&#8208;Solvent Reaction Leads to Bicomponent Aggregation&#8208;Induced Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Organic luminogens with persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have found a wide range of applications in sensing, bioimaging, illumination, and information encryption However, many RTP luminogens are prone to severe quenching in the crystalline state. Herein we report a working strategy to construct a donor&#8208;sp3&#8208;acceptor type of luminogen which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) while the donor&#8208;sp2&#8208;acceptor counterpart structure exhibits non&#8208;emissive solid state. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that a trace amount (0.01%) of structurally similar derivative, produced by a side reaction with the DMF solvent, could induce strong RTP with an absolute RTP yield up to 25.4% and a lifetime of 48 ms, although the identified substance does not show RTP by itself. Single&#8208;crystal XRD&#8208;based calculations suggest that n&#8208;&#963;* orbital interactions as a result of structural similarity may be responsible for the strong RTP in the bicomponent system.

      <title>Ni(COD)(DQ): An Air&#8208;Stable 18&#8208;Electron Nickel(0)&#8211;Olefin Precatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
Old complex, new tricks: Ni(COD)(DQ) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, DQ=duroquinone) is a remarkably stable Ni0&#8208;olefin complex first described in the 1960s. Its ability to serve as a precatalyst for a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions is demonstrated.







Abstract
We report that Ni(COD)(DQ) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, DQ=duroquinone), an air&#8208;stable 18&#8208;electron complex originally described by Schrauzer in 1962, is a competent precatalyst for a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthetic methods from the literature. Due to its apparent stability, use of Ni(COD)(DQ) as a precatalyst allows reactions to be conveniently performed without use of an inert&#8208;atmosphere glovebox, as demonstrated across several case studies.

      <title>General Strategy for Synthesis of Ordered Pt3M Intermetallics with Ultrasmall Particle Size</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel and general strategy for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported atomically ordered Pt3M (M=Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) intermetallic nanoparticles is reported under the aid of freeze&#8208;drying technology. This synthetic strategy is demonstrated to be effective for the preparation and handling of nanoparticles with controlled particle size and ordered phase.







Abstract
Controllable synthesis of atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial to obtain superior electrocatalytic performance for fuel cell reactions, but still remains arduous. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and general hydrogel&#8208;freeze drying strategy for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported Pt3M (M=Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) intermetallic NPs (Pt3M/rGO&#8208;HF) with ultrasmall particle size (about 3&#8197;nm) and dramatic monodispersity. The formation of hydrogel prevents the aggregation of graphene oxide and significantly promotes their excellent dispersion, while a freeze&#8208;drying can retain the hydrogel derived three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) porous structure and immobilize the metal precursors with defined atomic ratio on GO support during solvent sublimation, which is not afforded by traditional oven drying. The subsequent annealing process produces rGO supported ultrasmall ordered Pt3M intermetallic NPs (&#8776;3&#8197;nm) due to confinement effect of 3D porous structure. Such Pt3M intermetallic NPs exhibit the smallest particle size among the reported ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts. A detailed study of the synthesis of ordered intermetallic Pt3Mn/rGO catalyst is provided as an example of a generally applicable method. This study provides an economical and scalable route for the controlled synthesis of Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts, which can pave a way for the commercialization of fuel cell technologies.

      <title>Improved Acid Resistance of a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage Enables Cargo Release and Exchange between Hosts</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy for improving the acid resistance of a tetrahedral cage has been developed by incorporating additional free pyridyl units on its vertices. The guest binding properties of the cage are also altered compared to the analogous tetrahedron without these peripheral groups, allowing the functions of complete cargo delivery and exchange between the two capsules by using acid and base as chemical stimuli.







Abstract
The use of di(2&#8208;pyridyl)ketone in subcomponent self&#8208;assembly is introduced. When combined with a flexible triamine and zinc bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, this ketone formed a new Zn4L4 tetrahedron 1 bearing twelve uncoordinated pyridyl units around its metal&#8208;ion vertices. The acid stability of 1 was found to be greater than that of the analogous tetrahedron 2 built from 2&#8208;formylpyridine. Intriguingly, the peripheral presence of additional pyridine rings in 1 resulted in distinct guest binding behavior from that of 2, affecting guest scope as well as binding affinities. The different stabilities and guest affinities of capsules 1 and 2 enabled the design of systems whereby different cargoes could be moved between cages using acid and base as chemical stimuli.

      <title>The Glutathione/Metallothionein System Challenges the Design of Efficient O2&#8208;Activating Copper Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Copper complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs. O2&#8208;activating CuI/CuII complexes for cytosolic/nuclear targets are generally not stable against glutathione and metallothioneins, which are abundant in the nucleus and cytosol. This should be considered when designing CuI/CuII complexes for biological and medicinal applications.







Abstract
Copper complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs designed to cleave intracellular biomolecules by O2 activation. To exhibit such activity, the copper complex must be redox active and resistant to dissociation. Metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are abundant in the cytosol and nucleus. Because they are thiol&#8208;rich reducing molecules with high CuI affinity, they are potential competitors for a copper ion bound in a copper drug. Herein, we report the investigation of a panel of CuI/CuII complexes often used as drugs, with diverse coordination chemistries and redox potentials. We evaluated their catalytic activity in ascorbate oxidation based on redox cycling between CuI and CuII, as well as their resistance to dissociation or inactivation under cytosolically relevant concentrations of GSH and MT. O2&#8208;activating CuI/CuII complexes for cytosolic/nuclear targets are generally not stable against the GSH/MT system, which creates a challenge for their future design.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs designed to cleave intracellular biomolecules by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. To exhibit such activity, the copper complex must be redox active and resistant to dissociation. Metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are abundant in the cytosol and nucleus. Because they are thiol&#8208;rich reducing molecules with high Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; affinity, they are potential competitors for a copper ion bound in a copper drug. Herein, we report the investigation of a panel of Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes often used as drugs, with diverse coordination chemistries and redox potentials.

      <title>Abiotic Chemical Fuels for the Operation of Molecular Machines</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular gas station: This Minireview covers the state of the art of abiotic chemical fuels that have been used to trigger complete cycles of motion of molecular machines. Particular emphasis is placed on the operation mechanism of the machine/fuel systems.







Abstract
Natural molecular machines require a continuous fuel supply to perform motions and/or remain in a functional state. Consequently, the aim of developing artificial devices and materials with life&#8208;type properties has motivated a growing interest in abiotic chemical fuels and in their supply modalities. Many artificial molecular machines have been developed in which the sequential addition of several chemical reagents allows the machine to perform complete cycles of motion. Only recently, examples of molecular machines whose cycles of motion are triggered by a single pulse of fuel have been reported. The latter systems are the object of this Minireview where the abiotic chemical fuels used so far to trigger the complete cycles of motion of molecular machines are described, with particular emphasis on the operation mechanism of the machine/fuel systems.

Abstract
A divergent synthetic approach to six Ganoderma meroterpenoids, namely ganocins&#8197;A&#8211;C, ganocochlearins&#8197;C and D, and cochlearol&#8197;T, has been developed for the first time. This synthetic route features a two&#8208;phase strategy which includes early&#8208;stage rapid construction of a common planar tricyclic intermediate followed by highly selective late&#8208;stage transformations into various Ganoderma meroterpenoids. Key to the strategy are a bioinspired intramolecular hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and Stahl&#8208;type oxidative aromatization, allowing efficient formation of the common tricyclic phenol intermediate. A nucleophilic dearomatization of the phenol unit, combined with a regioselective 1,4&#8208;reduction of the resulting dienone, enabled rapid access to ganocins&#8197;B and C. Additionally, site&#8208;selective Mukaiyama hydration, followed by an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition/triflation cascade, served as a key strategic element in the chemical synthesis of ganocin&#8197;A.

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Interleukin&#8208;2 and Disulfide Stabilizing Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
Penicillin shot: Convergent, ester&#8208;forming KAHA ligations under acidic conditions facilitate the assembly of the hydrophobic cytokine interleukin&#8208;2. This flexible strategy allows the preparation of more stable disulfides analogues constructed from the non&#8208;canonical amino acid penicillamine.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis allows the construction of well&#8208;defined structural variations and facilitates the development of deeper understanding of protein structure&#8211;function relationships and new protein engineering strategies. Herein, we report the chemical synthesis of interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) variants on a multimilligram scale and the formation of non&#8208;natural disulfide mimetics that improve stability against reduction. The synthesis was accomplished by convergent KAHA ligations; the acidic conditions of KAHA ligation proved to be valuable for the solubilization of the hydrophobic segments of IL&#8208;2. The bioactivity of the synthetic IL&#8208;2 and its analogues were shown to be equipotent to recombinant IL&#8208;2 and exhibit improved stability against reducing agents.

      <title>Deoxyfluorination with CuF2: Enabled by Using a Lewis Base Activating Group
</title>
      <dc:description>
A Lewis base activating group strategy enables deoxyfluorination using first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides. Using CuF2 as an exemplar, activation of an O&#8208;alkylisourea adduct, formed in situ, allows effective nucleophilic fluoride transfer to a range of primary and secondary alcohols. Spectroscopic investigations were used to probe the origin of the enhanced reactivity of CuF2. The method is also amenable to 18F&#8208;radiolabeling.

Abstract
Deoxyfluorination is a primary method for the formation of C&#8722;F bonds. Bespoke reagents are commonly used because of issues associated with the low reactivity of metal fluorides. Reported here is the development of a simple strategy for deoxyfluorination, using first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides, and it overcomes these limitations. Using CuF2 as an exemplar, activation of an O&#8208;alkylisourea adduct, formed in situ, allows effective nucleophilic fluoride transfer to a range of primary and secondary alcohols. Spectroscopic investigations have been used to probe the origin of the enhanced reactivity of CuF2. The utility of the process in enabling 18F&#8208;radiolabeling is also presented.

Unprecedented synthetic routes to fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), from simple phenol derivatives by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulative dimerization of phenylene triflate through twofold inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation, have been established. The formed partially fused PAHs can be smoothly transformed into a variety of fully fused PAHs by the Scholl reaction.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent an emerging class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the area of optoelectronic devices and materials. Unprecedented synthetic routes to various PAHs from simple phenol derivatives by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulative dimerization of phenylene triflate through twofold inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation have been established. The initially formed partially fused PAHs can be smoothly transformed into a variety of fully fused PAHs by the Scholl reaction. Furthermore, the reactions of phenanthrene&#8208;substituted aryl triflates proceeded regioselectively. The findings inspired the development of a rapid and efficient synthesis of polybenzoacene derivatives. This study not only allows transformation of phenyl triflates, but also discloses a new retrosynthetic strategy towards PAHs, especially polybenzoacenes.

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Activity of Au(111) in Alkaline Media through Molecular Engineering of a 2D Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Moving catalysts on the volcano: The electrochemical production of hydrogen can be promoted by the synergy between a two&#8208;dimensional polymer and a gold electrode. Engineering the molecular structure of the polymer alters the adsorption energies of the reactants, intermediates, and products and helps to move gold towards the top of the volcano plot.







Abstract
The electrochemical splitting of water holds promise for the storage of energy produced intermittently by renewable energy sources. The evolution of hydrogen currently relies on the use of platinum as a catalyst&#8212;which is scarce and expensive&#8212;and ongoing research is focused towards finding cheaper alternatives. In this context, 2D polymers grown as single layers on surfaces have emerged as porous materials with tunable chemical and electronic structures that can be used for improving the catalytic activity of metal surfaces. Here, we use designed organic molecules to fabricate covalent 2D architectures by an Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reaction on Au(111). The polymer&#8208;patterned gold electrode exhibits a hydrogen evolution reaction activity up to three times higher than that of bare gold. Through rational design of the polymer on the molecular level we engineered hydrogen evolution activity by an approach that can be easily extended to other electrocatalytic reactions.

      <title>Mining Symbionts of a Spider&#8208;Transmitted Fungus Illuminates Uncharted Biosynthetic Pathways to Cytotoxic Benzolactones</title>
      <dc:description>
Spider sense: The fungus Rhizopus microsporus, isolated from necrotic tissue resulting from a spider bite, was found to contain bacteria (Burkholderia sp.) that produce a complex of highly cytotoxic compounds (necroximes). Analysis of the PKS/NRPS hybrid assembly line and genome mining revealed the molecular basis of the biosynthesis of V&#8208;ATPase&#8208;inhibiting antitumor agents from diverse biological origins.







Abstract
A spider&#8208;transmitted fungus (Rhizopus microsporus) that was isolated from necrotic human tissue was found to harbor endofungal bacteria (Burkholderia sp.). Metabolic profiling of the symbionts revealed a complex of cytotoxic agents (necroximes). Their structures were characterized as oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides with a peptidic side chain. The potently cytotoxic necroximes are also formed in symbiosis with the fungal host and could have contributed to the necrosis. Genome sequencing and computational analyses revealed a novel modular PKS/NRPS assembly line equipped with several non&#8208;canonical domains. Based on gene&#8208;deletion mutants, we propose a biosynthetic model for bacterial benzolactones. We identified specific traits that serve as genetic handles to find related salicylate macrolide pathways (lobatamide, oximidine, apicularen) in various other bacterial genera. Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway enables biosynthetic engineering and genome&#8208;mining approaches.

      <title>Accessing Tunable Afterglows from Highly Twisted Nonaromatic Organic AIEgens via Effective Through&#8208;Space Conjugation
</title>
      <dc:description>
AIE meets tunable afterglows: Highly distorted and nonaromatic CBSI and OBSI are non&#8208;luminescent when molecularly dissolved in solutions, but exhibit distinct AIE and tunable p&#8208;RTP features in aggregation states. This is on account of the effective through&#8208;space conjugation among the moieties with &#960; and/or n electrons, which results in the formation of diverse emissive clusters with highly rigidified conformations.







Abstract
Nonaromatic, cross&#8208;conjugated, and highly twisted luminogens consisting of acylated succinimides demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics along with tunable multicolor photoluminescence and afterglows in their single crystals. Effective through&#8208;space conjugation among different moieties bearing n/&#960; electrons promote the spin&#8211;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing and lead to diverse emissive clusters with concurrently rigidified conformations, thus allowing readily tunable emissions. Derived from it, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is illustrated. These results should spur the rational design of novel nonaromatic AIEgens, and moreover advance understandings of the non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence and the origin of tunable multicolor afterglows.

      <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA Functionalization of Upconversion Nanoparticles and Their Programmable Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;dependent interactions between DNA and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are systematically investigated. Poly&#8208;cytosine (poly&#8208;C) has a high affinity for the UCNP surface. Based on this finding, a general strategy to synthesize monodispersed DNA&#8208;UCNP conjugates is developed using poly&#8208;C&#8208;containing diblock DNA strands, which can be used for DNA&#8208;guided UCNP assembly.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (DNA&#8208;UCNPs) that combine the functions of DNA and the optical features of UCNPs have shown great promise in a wide range of fields. However, challenges remain in precisely tethering and orienting the DNA strands on the UCNP surface. Herein, we systematically investigate the sequence dependence of DNAs in their interactions with UCNPs, and reveal that poly&#8208;cytosine (poly&#8208;C) has high affinity for the UCNP surface. A general approach to synthesize monodispersed DNA&#8208;UCNP conjugates is developed using poly&#8208;C&#8208;containing diblock DNA strands. The poly&#8208;C segment of the DNA strand binds to the surfaces of UCNPs and the second segment is oriented perpendicularly on the UCNP surface, making the DNA&#8208;UCNPs highly stable and monodispersed in aqueous solution. The dense layer of DNA on the UCNP surface enables the programmable assembly of UCNPs with other DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles or DNA origamis through hybridization, resulting in the formation of well&#8208;organized complex structures.

      <dc:description>
The heat is on: Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine derivatives forms a nanostructured contrast agent, which displays improved photoacoustic and photothermal properties.







Abstract
Phototheranostic nanoplatforms are of particular interest for cancer diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided therapy. Herein, we develop a supramolecular approach to fabricate a nanostructured phototheranostic agent through the direct self&#8208;assembly of two water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine derivatives, PcS4 and PcN4. The nature of the molecular recognition between PcS4 and PcN4 facilitates the formation of nanostructure (PcS4&#8208;PcN4) and consequently enables the fabrication of PcS4&#8208;PcN4 with completely quenched fluorescence and reduced singlet oxygen generation, leading to the high photoacoustic and photothermal activity of PcS4&#8208;PcN4. In&#8197;vivo evaluations suggest that PcS4&#8208;PcN4 could not only efficiently visualize a tumor with high contrast through whole&#8208;body photoacoustic imaging but also enable excellent photothermal therapy for cancer.

      <title>A Photochemical Organocatalytic Strategy for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones by using Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
A radical time to alkylate ketones: A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach that enables the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using alkyl electrophiles recalcitrant to traditional ionic pathways is reported. The redox&#8208;neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with a chiral amine catalyst, which is used to develop a rare example of enantioselective organocatalytic &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones through a radical pathway.







Abstract
Reported herein is a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach to the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones. This method exploits the ability of a nucleophilic organocatalyst to generate radicals upon SN2&#8208;based activation of alkyl halides and blue light irradiation. The resulting open&#8208;shell intermediates are then intercepted by weakly nucleophilic silyl enol ethers, which would be unable to directly attack the alkyl halides through a traditional two&#8208;electron path. The mild reaction conditions allowed functionalization of the &#945; position of ketones with functional groups that are not compatible with classical anionic strategies. In addition, the redox&#8208;neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with a cinchona&#8208;based primary amine catalyst, which was used to develop a rare example of enantioselective organocatalytic radical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones.

      <title>Tailored Palladium Catalysts for Selective Synthesis of Conjugated Enynes by Monocarbonylation of 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
      <dc:description>
Precise synthesis: The new &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand Neolephos was designed and applied in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed monocarbonylation of 1,3&#8208;diynes. The precise synthesis of conjugated enynes was achieved in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yield with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The presented methodology can be used for simple diversification of natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
For the first time, the monoalkoxycarbonylation of easily available 1,3&#8208;diynes to give synthetically useful conjugated enynes has been realized. Key to success was the design and utilization of the new ligand 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphanyl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene (Neolephos), which permits the palladium&#8208;catalyzed selective carbonylation under mild conditions, providing a general preparation of functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields with excellent chemoselectivities. Synthetic applications that showcase the possibilities of this novel methodology include an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrans as well as the rapid construction of various heterocyclic, bicyclic, and polycyclic compounds.

Abstract
An enantioselective aldehyde &#945;&#8208;alkylation/semipinacol rearrangement was achieved through organo&#8208;SOMO catalysis. The catalytically generated enamine radical cation serves as a carbon radical electrophile that can stereoselectively add to the alkene of an allylic alcohol and initiate ensuing ring&#8208;expansion of cyclopropanol or cyclobutanol. This tandem reaction enables the production of a wide range of nonracemic functionalizable &#945;&#8208;quaternary&#8208;&#948;&#8208;carbonyl cycloketones in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity from simple aldehydes and allylic alcohols. As a key step, the intramolecular reaction was also successfully applied in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cerapicol.

      <title>Bidentate Chiral Bis(imidazolium)&#8208;Based Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors: Synthesis and Applications in Enantioselective Recognition and Catalysis
</title>
      <dc:description>
Enantioselective process: A dicationic bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donor based on iodoimidazolium groups with rigidly attached chiral moieties allowed the NMR&#8208;based enantiodiscrimination of a racemic diamine. It also enabled the first enantioselective reaction catalyzed by a &#8220;pure&#8221; halogen&#8208;based Lewis acid.







Abstract
Even though halogen bonding&#8212;the noncovalent interaction between electrophilic halogen substituents and Lewis bases&#8212;has now been established in molecular recognition and catalysis, its use in enantioselective processes is still very rarely explored. Herein, we present the synthesis of chiral bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donors based on two iodoimidazolium units with rigidly attached chiral sidearms.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enantioselective process&lt;/b&gt;: A dicationic bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donor based on iodoimidazolium groups with rigidly attached chiral moieties allowed the NMR&#8208;based enantiodiscrimination of a racemic diamine. It also enabled the first enantioselective reaction catalyzed by a &#8220;pure&#8221; halogen&#8208;based Lewis acid.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though halogen bonding&#8212;the noncovalent interaction between electrophilic halogen substituents and Lewis bases&#8212;has now been established in molecular recognition and catalysis, its use in enantioselective processes is still very rarely explored. Herein, we present the synthesis of chiral bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donors based on two iodoimidazolium units with rigidly attached chiral sidearms. With these Lewis acids, chiral recognition of a racemic diamine is achieved in NMR studies. DFT calculations support a 1:1 interaction of the halogen&#8208;bond donor with both enantiomers and indicate that the chiral recognition is based on a different spatial orientation of the Lewis bases in the halogen&#8208;bonded complexes. In addition, moderate enantioselectivity is achieved in a Mukaiyama aldol reaction with a preorganized variant of the chiral halogen&#8208;bond donor. This represents the first case in which asymmetric induction was realized with a pure halogen&#8208;bond donor lacking any additional active functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electrochemically Driven Cation Exchange Enables the Rational Design of Active CO2 Reduction Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Exchange of catalytic centers: Electrochemically driven cation exchange is a new method for the direct transformation of a H2 evolution catalyst (CoS2) into a CO2 reduction catalyst (Cu2S) by facile and systematic tuning of the ratio of binary cations. This method can rationally target catalytically active species (e.g. grain boundaries) and results in a superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency [Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 87&#8201;%].







Abstract
Metal oxides or sulfides are considered to be one of the most promising CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) precatalysts, owing to their electrochemical conversion in&#8197;situ into highly active electrocatalytic species. However, further improvement of the performance requires new tools to gain fine control over the composition of the active species and its structural features [e.g., grain boundaries (GBs) and undercoordinated sites (USs)], directly from a predesigned template material. Herein, we describe a novel electrochemically driven cation exchange (ED&#8208;CE) method that enables the conversion of a predesigned CoS2 template into a CO2RR catalyst, Cu2S. By means of ED&#8208;CE, the final Cu2S catalyst inherits the original 3&#8201;D morphology of CoS2, and preserves its high density of GBs. Additionally, the catalyst's phase structure, composition, and density of USs were precisely tuned, thus enabling rational design of active CO2RR sites. The obtained Cu2S catalyst achieved a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate Faradaic efficiency of over 87&#8201;% and a record high activity (among reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts). Hence, this study opens the way for utilization of ED&#8208;CE reactions to design advanced electrocatalysts.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Regulated Rhodium&#8211;Antimony Nanorods for Nitrogen Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8211;antimony nanorods: A unique class of surface&#8208;rough Rh2Sb nanorods (RNRs) has been created. Rh2Sb RNRs/C showed enhanced N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance with NH3 yield rate of 228.85&#177;12.96&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh at &#8722;0.45&#8197;VRHE, outperforming the surface&#8208;smooth Rh2Sb NRs/C, as well as the Rh nanoparticles/C, demonstrating the important role of surface regulation in boosting NRR.







Abstract
Surface regulation is an effective strategy to improve the performance of catalysts, but it has been rarely demonstrated for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to date. Now, surface&#8208;rough Rh2Sb nanorod (RNR) and surface&#8208;smooth Rh2Sb NR (SNR) were selectively created, and their performance for NRR was investigated. The high&#8208;index&#8208;facet bounded Rh2Sb RNRs/C exhibit a high NH3 yield rate of 228.85&#177;12.96&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh at &#8722;0.45&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), outperforming the Rh2Sb SNRs/C (63.07&#177;4.45&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh) and Rh nanoparticles/C (22.82&#177;1.49&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh), owing to the enhanced adsorption and activation of N2 on high&#8208;index facets. Rh2Sb RNRs/C also show durable stability with negligible activity decay after 10&#8197;h of successive electrolysis. The present work demonstrates that surface regulation plays an important role in promoting NRR activity and provides a new strategy for creating efficient NRR electrocatalysts.

The incorporation of comonomers during ethylene polymerization can efficiently modulate important material properties of the polyolefins.

      <dc:description>
Weak bond, positive effect: A unique positive temperature effect in the single fluorescence emission of a fluorescent dyad containing both donor and acceptor moieties was observed. The origin is ascribed to the presence of coplanar and twisted structures owing to the driving of weak intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
The origin of the positive temperature effect in fluorescence emission of a newly designed perylene bisimide (PBI) derivative with two naphthyl units containing ortho&#8208;methoxy group (NM) at its bay positions (PBI&#8208;2NM) was elucidated. A key point is the finding of a weak hydrogen bond (&lt;5.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) between the methoxy group of the NM unit and a nearby hydrogen atom of the PBI core. It is the bonding that drives co&#8208;planarization of the different aromatic units, resulting in delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the compound as synthesized, inducing fluorescence quenching via intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). With increasing temperature, the co&#8208;planar structure could be distorted in part, resulting in a decreased degree of ICT, and hence leading to enhanced fluorescence emission. The unique positive temperature effect in emission induced by H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven co&#8208;planarization may pave a new avenue in designing functional molecular systems complementary to conventional methods.

      <title>An Activatable Polymeric Reporter for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Imaging of Invasive Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
A polymeric NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic probe: An activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) is designed to produce near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to a biomarker (urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator) for in&#8197;vivo imaging of invasive breast cancers. P&#8208;Dex not only has a high sensitivity and specificity towards the cancer biomarker but also undergoes renal clearance in living mice.







Abstract
Discriminative detection of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers is crucial for their effective treatment and prognosis. However, activatable probes able to do so in&#8197;vivo are rare. Herein, we report an activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) that specifically turns on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and photoacoustic (PA) signals in response to the urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) overexpressed in invasive breast cancer. P&#8208;Dex has a renal&#8208;clearable dextran backbone that is linked with a NIR dye caged with an uPA&#8208;cleavable peptide substrate. Such a molecular design allows P&#8208;Dex to passively target tumors, activate NIR fluorescence and PA signals to effectively distinguish invasive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer from noninvasive MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to minimize the toxicity potential. Thus, this polymeric reporter holds great promise for the early detection of malignant breast cancer.

      <title>Insights into Charge Transfer at an Atomically Precise Nanocluster/Semiconductor Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
Multitasking: Metal nanoclusters are not merely photosensitizers, they can also act as co&#8208;catalysts under appropriate conditions. Deposition of the atomically precise nanocluster Ag44(thiolate)30 onto a large&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor such as TiO2 led to a type&#8197;II heterojunction charge&#8208;transfer route being achieved on irradiation with UV/Vis light, with the cluster serving as a small&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor, rather than merely a photosensitizer.







Abstract
The deposition of an atomically precise nanocluster, for example, Ag44(SR)30, onto a large&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor such as TiO2 allows a clear interface to be obtained to study charge transfer at the interface. Changing the light source from visible light to simulated sunlight led to a three orders of magnitude enhancement in the photocatalytic H2 generation, with the H2 production rate reaching 7.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1. This is five times higher than that of TiO2 modified with Ag nanoparticles and even comparable to that of TiO2 modified with Pt nanoparticles under similar conditions. Energy band alignment and transient absorption spectroscopy reveal that the role of the metal clusters is different from that of both organometallic complexes and plasmonic nanoparticles: A type&#8197;II heterojunction charge&#8208;transfer route is achieved under UV/Vis irradiation, with the cluster serving as a small&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor. This results in the clusters acting as co&#8208;catalysts rather than merely photosensitizers.

      <title>Constant Electricity Generation in Nanostructured Silicon via Evaporation&#8208;driven Water Flow</title>
      <dc:description>Very recently, hydrovoltaic technology is emerging as a novel renewable energy harvesting method through carefully controlling the interaction between water and solid surface, which dramatically extends the capability to harvest water energy. However, the urgent issue restricting its device performance is poor carrier transport properties of the solid surface if large charged interface is considered simultaneously.

In addition, this device exhibits a constant output power density of over 6 &#956;W/cm  2  and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to 400 mV, which enables it to easily drive a commercial light emitting diode. We also demonstrate the potential application of this electrokinetic phenomenon by using it to create a breathing sensor. Through changing ion concentration in water, length and surface charge of SiNWs, we propose the mechanism of harvesting energy through water flow in SiNWs.

      <title>Stability and degradation mechanisms of copper&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Up to date, copper is the only monometallic catalyst that can electrochemically reduce CO2  into high value and energy&#8208;dense products, such as hydrocarbons and alcohols. In recent years, great efforts have been directed towards understanding how its nanoscale structure affects activity and selectivity for the electrochemical CO2  reduction reaction (CO2RR).

      <title>Synthesis and Diverse Transformations of a Dinitrogen Dititanium Hydride Complex Bearing Rigid Acridane&#8208;Based PNP&#8208;Pincer Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Ti, NN, Ti: A dinitrogen dititanium hydride complex bearing the rigid acridane&#8208;based acriPNP&#8208;pincer ligand undergoes diverse transformations with a variety of organometallic compounds. Many aspects of the dinitrogen reaction chemistry are thus revealed.







Abstract
Studies on N2 activation and transformation by transition metal hydride complexes are of particular interest and importance. The synthesis and diverse transformations of a dinitrogen dititanium hydride complex bearing the rigid acridane&#8208;based acriPNP&#8208;pincer ligands {[(acriPNP)Ti]2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;2&#8208;N2)(&#956;2&#8208;H)2} are presented. This complex enabled N2 cleavage and hydrogenation even without additional H2 or other reducing agents. Furthermore, diverse transformations of the N2 unit with a variety of organometallic compounds such as ZnMe2, MgMe2, AlMe3, B(C6F5)3, PinBH, and PhSiH3 have been well established at the rigid acriPNP&#8208;ligated dititanium framework, such as reversible bonding&#8208;mode change between the end&#8208;on and side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on fashions, diborylative N=N bond cleavage, the formal insertion of two dimethylaluminum species into the N=N bond, and the formal insertion of two silylene units into the N=N bond. This work has revealed many unprecedented aspects of dinitrogen reaction chemistry.

Due to its high recall and precision rates of 95.1% and 80.3%, respectively, on an independent test set of 122 maps, it can also be used for validation during model building.

      <title>Electrochemical Oxidation of Nitrogen towards Direct Nitrate Production on Spinel Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrates are widely used as fertilizer and oxidizing agents. Commercial nitrate production from nitrogen is mainly through the Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process and Ostwald process, both involving high&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;pressure processes. Therefore, establishing an alternative nitrate production method under ambient environment is of paramount importance. Herein, an electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) approach is developed to produce nitrate catalyzed by ZnFexCo2&#8208;xO4 spinel oxides in an alkaline electrolyte. As revealed by theoretical and experimental results, Fe is found to facilitate the formation of the first N&#8208;O bond on the *N site, while high oxidation state Co assists in stabilizing the absorbed OH&#8208; for the successful generation of the second and third N&#8208;O bonds. Owing to the concerted catalysis, the ZnFe0.4Co1.6O4 oxide demonstrates the highest nitrate production rate of 130 &#177; 12 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 gMO&#8208;1 at an applied potential of 1.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

      <title>Pressure&#8208;induced inverse order&#8208;disorder transition</title>
      <dc:description>Given the consensus that pressure improves cation ordering in most of known materials, a discovery of pressure&#8208;induced disordering could require recognition of order&#8208;disorder transition in solid state physics/chemistry and geophysics. Double perovskites Y  2  CoIrO  6  and Y  2  CoRuO  6  polymorphs synthesized at 0, 6 and 15 GPa show  B  &#8208;site ordering, partial&#8208;ordering and disordering respectively, accompanied by lattice compression and crystal structure alteration from monoclinic to orthorhombic symmetry. Correspondingly, the long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic ordering in the  B  &#8208;site ordered samples are gradually overwhelmed by  B  &#8208;site disorder. Theoretical calculations suggest that unusual unit cell compressions under external pressures unexpectedly stabilize the disordered phases of Y  2  CoIrO  6  and Y  2  CoRuO  6  .</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Organometallic Intermediates Relevant to Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation</title>
      <dc:description>Intermediates relevant to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroformylation have been isolated and evaluated in fundamental organometallic transformations relevant to the catalytic process. Among these, the 18&#8208;electron cobalt carbonyl hydride with a chiral bis(phosphine), (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;(  iPr  DuPhos)Co(CO)  2  H has been structurally characterized. Despite being an analog of rhodium precatalysts widely used in asymmetric hydroformylation, (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;(  iPr  DuPhos)Co(CO)  2  H promoted exclusive hydrogenation of styrene in the presence of 750 psi of H  2  /CO gas (1:1) at 100 &#186;C. Deuterium labeling studies established reversible 2,1 insertion of styrene into the Co&#8211;D bond of (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;(  iPr  DuPhos)Co(CO)  2  D. Whereas rapid &#946;&#8208;H elimination from cobalt alkyls occurred under an atmosphere of N  2  , alkylation of the cobalt chloride (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;(  iPr  DuPhos)Co(CO)  2  Cl in the presence of CO enabled the interception of a cobalt acyl complex, (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;(  iPr  DuPhos)Co(CO)  2  C(O)CH  2  CH  2  Ph. Hydrogenolysis of the cobalt acyl under 4 atm H  2  produced the corresponding aldehyde and cobalt hydride, demonstrating the feasibility of elementary steps in hydroformylation.
