      <dc:description>Thiol&#8208;ene cationic and radical reactions were conducted not only for 1:1 addition between thiol and vinyl ether but also for cyclization and step&#8208;growth polymerization between dithiol and divinyl ether.&#160; An organic acid catalyst such as  p  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) induced the cationic thiol&#8208;ene reaction to generate the thioacetal as the Markovnikov adduct in high yield, whereas organic radical initiators such as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) caused the radical thiol&#8208;ene reaction to give the thioether as the anti&#8208;Markovnikov adduct, also in high yield.&#160; The cationic and radical addition reactions between dithiol and divinyl ether with oxyethylene units allowed the starting materials to efficiently undergo both cationic step&#8208;growth polymerization in the presence of PTSA and radical polymerization in the presence of AIBN or under UV irradiation to yield amorphous poly(thioacetal)s and crystalline poly(thioether)s, respectively.&#160; In contrast, under high dilution conditions, the cationic and radical reactions resulted in 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal and thioether products, respectively, which have a structure similar to that of crown ether.&#160; Furthermore, concurrent cationic and radical step&#8208;growth polymerizations were realized using PTSA under UV irradiation to produce polymers composed of both thioacetal and thioether linkages in the main chains, where the polymer properties are arbitrarily tunable by the concentration of PTSA or the content of the two linkages.</dc:description>

      <title>Mining Symbionts of Spider&#8208;Transmitted Fungus Illuminates Uncharted Biosynthetic Pathways to Cytotoxic Benzolactones</title>
      <dc:description>A spider&#8208;transmitted fungus (  Rhizopus microsporus  ) that was isolated from necrotic human tissue was found to harbor endofungal bacteria (  Burkholderia  sp.). Metabolic profiling of the symbionts revealed a complex of cytotoxic agents (necroximes). Their structures were fully characterized as oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides equipped with a peptidic side chain. Necroximes are potent cytotoxic agents that are also formed in symbiosis with the fungal host and could have contributed to the necrosis. Genome sequencing and in silico analyses revealed a novel modular PKS/NRPS assembly line equipped with several non&#8208;canonical domains. Based on gene deletion mutants, we propose the first biosynthetic model for bacterial benzolactones. We identified specific traits that serve as genetic handles to identify related salicylate macrolide pathways in various other bacterial genera (lobatamide, oximidine, apicularen and cruentaren). Our work sets an unusual example of hypothesis&#8208;based drug discovery in the context of human disease. Knowledge on the biosynthetic pathway initiates biosynthetic engineering and genome&#8208;mining approaches.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermal and Nonthermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrochemistry at Nanostructured Ag Electrode</title>
      <dc:description>Hot carriers (HCs) and thermal effects, stemming from plasmon decays, are crucial for most plasmonic applications. However, quantifying these two effects remains extremely challenging due to the experimental difficulty in accurately measuring the temperature at reaction sites. Herein, we provide a novel strategy to disentangle HCs from photothermal effects based on the different traits of heat dissipation (long range) and HCs transport (short range), and quantitatively uncover the dominant and potential&#8208;dependent role of photothermal effect by investigating the rapid&#8208; and slow&#8208; response currents in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrochemistry at nanostructured Ag electrode. Furthermore, the plasmoelectric surface potential is found to contribute to the rapid&#8208;response currents, which is absent in the previous studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Genome mining of oxidation modules in trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases reveals a culturable source for lobatamides</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial&#160;  trans  &#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (  trans  &#8208;AT PKSs) are multimodular megaenzymes that biosynthesize many bioactive natural products. They contain a remarkable range of domains and module types that introduce different substituents into growing polyketide chains. As one such modification, we recently reported Baeyer&#8208;Villiger&#8208;type oxygen insertion into nascent&#160;&#160;polyketide backbones, generating malonyl thioester intermediates. In this work, genome mining focusing on architecturally diverse oxidation modules in&#160;  trans  &#8208;AT PKSs led us to the culturable plant symbiont&#160;  Gynuella sunshinyii  &#160;that harbors two distinct modules in one orphan PKS. The PKS product was revealed to be lobatamide A, a potent cytotoxin previously only known from a marine tunicate. Biochemical studies show that one module generates glycolyl thioester intermediates, while the other is proposed to be involved in oxime formation. The data suggest varied roles of oxygenation modules in the biosynthesis of polyketide scaffolds and support the importance of&#160;  trans  &#8208;AT PKSs in the specialized metabolism of symbiotic bacteria.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Boronate Ester Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Large Single Crystalline Domains for Neuromorphic Memory Device</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of crystalline boronate ester covalent organic frameworks (BECOFs) in powder and thin&#8208;film through solvothermal method and on&#8208;solid&#8208;surface synthesis, respectively, their applications in electronics, remain less explored due to the challenges in thin&#8208;film processability and device integration associated with the control of film thickness, layer orientation, stability and crystallinity. Moreover, although the crystalline domain sizes of the powder samples can reach micrometer scale (up to ~1.5 &#181;m), the reported thin&#8208;film samples have so far rather small crystalline domains up to 100 nm. Here we demonstrate an&#160;efficient synthesis of crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BECOF films composed of porphyrin macrocycles and phenyl or naphthyl linkers (named as  2D BECOF&#8208;PP  or  2D BECOF&#8208;PN  ) by employing a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) on the water surface. The achieved 2D BECOF&#8208;PP is featured as free&#8208;standing thin film with large single&#8208;crystalline domains up to ~60 &#181;m  2  and tunable thickness from 6 to 16 nm. The molecular&#8208;level structures are clearly resolved by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;TEM) and selected&#8208;area electron diffraction (SAED) which are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Due to the high crystallinity, facile thin&#8208;film processability, high mechanical stability as well as the incorporation of electroactive porphyrin monomers, a hybrid memory device composed of 2D BECOF&#8208;PP film on silicon nanowire&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor is demonstrated as a bio&#8208;inspired system to mimic neuronal synapses, displaying a learning&#8208;erasing&#8208;forgetting memory process. Pulsed voltage input induces the polarization of the film that is critical to emulate the potentiation of the neuronal membrane. This work paves the way to develop highly crystalline 2D COF thin film as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate active component applicable for CMOS&#8208;compatible neuromorphic computing.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropanes through Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Pseudotransannular Desymmetrization</title>
      <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of tropanols has been accomplished through chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed pseudotransannular ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;derived epoxides.

      <title>Redox Stability Controls the Cellular Uptake and Activity of Ruthenium&#8208;Based Inhibitors of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU)</title>
      <dc:description>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is the ion channel that mediates Ca  2+  uptake in the mitochondria. Inhibitors of the MCU are valuable as potential therapeutic agents and tools to study mitochondrial Ca  2+  . The best&#8208;known inhibitor of the MCU is the ruthenium compound Ru360. Although this compound is effective in permeabilized cells, it does not work in intact biological systems. We have recently reported the synthesis and characterization of Ru265, a complex that selectively inhibits the MCU in intact cells. Here, the physical and biological properties of Ru265 and Ru360 are described in detail. Using atomic absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging, we show that only Ru265 is transported by organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3). As an explanation for the poor cell uptake of Ru360, we show that Ru360 is deactivated by biological reductants. These data highlight how structural modifications in metal complexes can have profound effects on their biological activities.</dc:description>

      <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Approach for the Detection of Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 in Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing of COX&#8208;2: An isoform&#8208;selective fluorogenic probe reports on enzymatic activity within live cells. A two&#8208;step activation facilitates the release of the natural product and resorufin for confocal imaging and flow cytometry. CoxFluor indicates that COX&#8208;2 activity can be regulated by oxygen without a change in the protein expression level.







Abstract
Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) overexpression is prominent in inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Directly monitoring COX&#8208;2 activity within its native environment poses an exciting approach to account for and illuminate the effect of the local environments on protein activity. Herein, we report the development of CoxFluor, the first activity&#8208;based sensing approach for monitoring COX&#8208;2 within live cells with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. CoxFluor strategically links a natural substrate with a dye precursor to engage both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of COX&#8208;2. This catalyzes the release of resorufin and the natural product, as supported by molecular dynamics and ensemble docking. CoxFluor enabled the detection of oxygen&#8208;dependent changes in COX&#8208;2 activity that are independent of protein expression within live macrophage cells.

      <title>Structure Selectivity of Alkaline Periodate Oxidation on Lignocellulose for Facile Isolation of Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure based: A novel method based on a recyclable and newly selective alkaline periodate oxidation at pH&#8197;10 provides a sustainable strategy for the efficient isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from various lignocellulosic materials. Isolation of the CNCs results from the structural differences between the ordered and non&#8208;ordered regions of the lignocellulose.







Abstract
Reported here for the first time is the alkaline periodate oxidation of lignocelluloses for the selective isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). With the high concentrations as a potassium salt at pH&#8197;10, periodate ions predominantly exist as dimeric orthoperiodate ions (H2I2O104&#8722;). With reduced oxidizing activity in alkaline solutions, dimeric orthoperiodate ions preferentially oxidized non&#8208;ordered cellulose regions. The alkaline surroundings promoted the degradation of these oxidized cellulose chains by &#946;&#8208;alkoxy fragmentation and generated CNCs. The obtained CNCs were uniform in size and generally contained carboxy groups. Furthermore, the reaction solution could be reused after regeneration of the periodate with ozone gas. This method allows direct production of CNCs from diverse sources, in particular lignocellulosic raw materials including sawdust (European beech and Scots pine), flax, and kenaf, in addition to microcrystalline cellulose and pulp.

      <title>Polymer Nanocontainers for Intracellular Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Special delivery: Carrier systems for intracellular delivery are required to overcome limitations of therapeutic agents. Nanocontainers comprised of an aqueous core and a polymer shell offer the possibility of stimuli&#8208;responsive payload release and surface modification to enhance local selectivity. This Minireview considers the synthesis and properties of polymer nanocontainers for intracellular delivery.







Abstract
Carriers for intracellular delivery are required to overcome limitations of therapeutic agents such as low specificity, systemic toxicity, high clearance rate, and low therapeutic index. Nanocontainers comprised of an aqueous core and a polymer shell have received increasing attention because they readily combine stimuli response to improve intracellular payload release and surface modification to enhance selectivity towards the desired region of action. This Minireview summarizes the design and properties of polymer nanocontainers for intracellular delivery, classified according to the polymer architecture.

      <title>Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Performance enhancers: Electrolytes for Li&#8211;air batteries include non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, and hybrid electrolytes. This Review shows the importance of electrolytes to the mechanisms and performance of lithium&#8211;air batteries and provides a basis for selecting suitable electrolytes. The existing challenges, solutions, as well as guidance for the future direction of this field are also considered.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;air batteries are promising devices for electrochemical energy storage because of their ultrahigh energy density. However, it is still challenging to achieve practical Li&#8211;air batteries because of their severe capacity fading and poor rate capability. Electrolytes are the prime suspects for cell failure. In this Review, we focus on the opportunities and challenges of electrolytes for rechargeable Li&#8211;air batteries. A detailed summary of the reaction mechanisms, internal compositions, instability factors, selection criteria, and design ideas of the considered electrolytes is provided to obtain appropriate strategies to meet the battery requirements. In particular, ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes and solid&#8208;state electrolytes show exciting opportunities to control both the high energy density and safety.

      <title>Synthetic Applications of Oxidative Aromatic Coupling&#8212;From Biphenols to Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Coupling up: The dehydrogenative coupling of arenes is an ultimate example of C&#8722;H activation. This Review highlights the most exciting examples of the Scholl reaction, ranging from the synthesis of biphenols through natural products to nanographenes and on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation reported since 2013.







Abstract
Oxidative aromatic coupling occupies a fundamental place in the modern chemistry of aromatic compounds. It is a method of choice for the assembly of large and bewildering architectures. Considerable effort was also devoted to applications of the Scholl reaction for the synthesis of chiral biphenols and natural products. The ability to form biaryl linkages without any prefunctionalization provides an efficient pathway to many complex structures. Although the chemistry of this process is only now becoming fully understood, this reaction continues to both fascinate and challenge researchers. This is especially true for heterocoupling, that is, oxidative aromatic coupling with the chemoselective formation of a C&#8722;C bond between two different arenes. Analysis of the progress achieved in this field since 2013 reveals that many groups have contributed by pushing the boundary of structural possibilities, expanding into surface&#8208;assisted (cyclo)dehydrogenation, and developing new reagents.

      <title>Amperometric Measurements and Dynamic Models Reveal a Mechanism for How Zinc Alters Neurotransmitter Release</title>
      <dc:description>
From dense core to halo: Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using TEM was combined with monitoring and modelling single&#8208;cell amperometric responses to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to explain the regulation mechanism of synaptic plasticity by Zn2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.







Abstract
Zinc, a suspected potentiator of learning and memory, is shown to affect exocytotic release and storage in neurotransmitter&#8208;containing vesicles. Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using transmission electron microscopy was combined with single&#8208;cell amperometry to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to compare these changes to theoretical predictions based on the concept of partial release as opposed to full quantal release. This powerful combined analytical approach establishes the existence of an unsuspected strong link between vesicle structure and exocytotic dynamics, which can be used to explain the mechanism of regulation of synaptic plasticity by Zn2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.

      <title>From Decades to Minutes.&#160; Steps Toward the Structure of Strychnine, 1910 &#8211; 1948, and the Application of Today&#8217;s Technology</title>
      <dc:description>Between 1910 and 1947, Robert Robinson (primarily) among others published numerous proposed structures for strychnine.&#160; Robinson published 17 of his strychnine papers with his doctoral advisor William Henry Perkin, Jr., though all but 2 appeared after Robinson had taken his first permanent academic position.&#160; This paper reports on and analyzes 20 key publications leading up to Robinson&#8217;s (correct, then incorrect, then correct again though not definitive) proposal and Woodward&#8217;s assignment of the actual structure of strychnine.&#160; We subjected the assignment of the strychnine structure to a modern computational quantum chemistry workflow. &#160;By computing, with density functional theory, 1H and 13C chemical shifts for the literature&#8208;proposed strychnine structures, we were able to rule out most incorrect structures. 13C NMR predictions were better at this, but 1H chemical shifts were helpful.&#160; A comparison is made between the consequences of publishing erroneous ideas in the first half of the 20th century and doing so in the 21st century.</dc:description>

      <title>Styrene Hydroformylation with In situ H: Regioselectivity Control by Coupling with Low&#8208;temperature Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Hydroformylation of olefins is one of the most important homogeneously catalyzed industrial reactions for aldehyde synthesis. Various ligands are usually used to obtain desired linear aldehydes in aliphatic olefin hydroformylation. However, in aromatic hydroformylation it prefers to obtain branched aldehydes with common ligands, posing a grand challenge for the synthesis of linear products. In this work a novel approach to selectively obtain linear aldehydes in hydroformylation of styrene and its derivatives was realized by coupling with a water&#8208;gas shift reaction on Rh single&#8208;atom catalyst without using ligands. Detailed studies revealed that the in situ H generated from the water&#8208;gas shift plays a critical role in determining the high regioselectivity to linear products. The coupling of a traditionally homogeneous catalysis process with a heterogeneous catalysis reaction to tune product selectivity may provide a new avenue for the heterogenization of homogenous catalysis process.</dc:description>

The use of this mechanistic and protein characterization tool is demonstrated with holo glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5) homodimer and holo GLRX5:BolA&#8208;like protein 3 (BOLA3) heterodimer. Using the OBE nMS method, cluster transfer reactions between the holo&#8208;dimers and apo&#8208;ferredoxin (FDX2) are monitored, and intermediate [2Fe&#8208;2S] species such as (FDX2:GLRX5:[2Fe&#8208;2S]:GSH) and (FDX2:BOLA3:GLRX5:[2Fe&#8208;2S]: GSH) are detected.

      <dc:description>The redox reaction of oxygen has been considered critical in controlling the electrochemical properties of Li&#8208;excessive layered oxide electrodes.

Our results clarify the reaction mechanism at high potentials in conventional layered electrodes involving both cationic and anionic reactions.

      <title>Coupling of Solar Energy and Thermal Energy for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Status and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
A bundle of energy: The coupling of solar energy and thermal energy is a promising strategy to mediate the activity and/or selectivity of CO2 reduction. The status and prospects of this topic are reviewed, with the aim of providing guidelines for the design of new catalysts.







Abstract
Enormous efforts have been devoted to the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) by utilizing various driving forces, such as heat, electricity, and radiation. However, the efficient reduction of CO2 is still challenging because of sluggish kinetics. Recent pioneering studies from several groups, including us, have demonstrated that the coupling of solar energy and thermal energy offers a novel and promising strategy to promote the activity and/or manipulate selectivity in CO2 reduction. Herein, we clarify the definition and principles of coupling solar energy and thermal energy, and comprehensively review the status and prospects of CO2 reduction by coupling solar energy and thermal energy. Catalyst design, reactor configuration, photo&#8208;mediated activity/selectivity, and mechanism studies in photo&#8208;thermo CO2 reduction will be emphasized. The aim of this Review is to promote understanding towards CO2 activation and provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts for the efficient reduction of CO2.

      <title>Deracemization Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited deracemization: Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been utilized to convert racemates into single enantiomers in the presence of a chiral photosensitizer or a pair of chiral catalysts. Mechanistic studies revealed that energy transfer (EnT) or a sequence of electron transfer (ET), proton transfer (PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is operative.







Abstract
Deracemization is an ideal but challenging strategy for the conversion of a racemic mixture into a single enantiomer. Recent studies have demonstrated that visible&#8208;light photocatalysis could be utilized to promote selective deracemization of axially chiral allenes as well as cyclopropylquinolones and cyclic ureas with central chirality either through energy transfer or through a sequence of electron, proton, and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Deracemization Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excited deracemization&lt;/b&gt;: Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been utilized to convert racemates into single enantiomers in the presence of a chiral photosensitizer or a pair of chiral catalysts. Mechanistic studies revealed that energy transfer (E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;T) or a sequence of electron transfer (ET), proton transfer (PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is operative.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deracemization is an ideal but challenging strategy for the conversion of a racemic mixture into a single enantiomer. Recent studies have demonstrated that visible&#8208;light photocatalysis could be utilized to promote selective deracemization of axially chiral allenes as well as cyclopropylquinolones and cyclic ureas with central chirality either through energy transfer or through a sequence of electron, proton, and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanotheranostic System for Precise Diagnosis and Treatment of Peritoneal Metastasis</title>
      <dc:description>Activatable theranostic systems display potential for improved tumor diagnosis and therapy owing to high detection specificities, effective ablation, and minimal side&#8208;effects. Herein, a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostic system (FEAD1) for precise diagnosis and treatment of peritoneal metastases is presented. FEAD1 was fabricated by self&#8208;assembling the peptide Fmoc&#8208;His, mercaptopropionic&#8208;functionalized Ag  2  S quantum dots (MPA&#8208;Ag  2  S QDs), the chemodrug doxorubicin (DOX), and NIR absorber A1094 into nanoparticles. We show that in healthy tissue, FEAD1 exists in an NIR&#8208;II fluorescence &#8220;off&#8221; state, because of Ag  2  S QDs&#8211;A1094 interactions, while DOX remains in stealth mode. Upon delivery of FEAD1 to the tumor, the acidic TME triggers its disassembly through breakage of the Fmoc&#8208;His metal coordination and DOX hydrophobic interactions. Release of A1094 switches on Ag  2  S fluorescence, illuminating the tumor, accompanied by burst release of DOX within the tumor tissue, thereby achieving precise tumor theranostics. This TME&#8208;activated theranostic strategy holds great promise for future clinical applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Voltage decay and capacity fading are the main challenges for the commercialization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs), resulting from the release of oxygen at high voltage and the corrosion of electrolyte.

Oxygen vacancy and spinel phase integration suppress irreversible O  2  release and help lithium ion diffusion, while N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayer mitigates the corrosion of electrolyte with excellent conductivity. The electrochemical performance of LMNO after the treatment improves significantly, i.e., the initial discharge specific capacity reaches 245.5 mAh g&#8208;1  at 0.5 C without obvious attenuation after 100 cycles. Surprisingly, the capacity retention rate after 500 cycles at 1 C is still as high as 89.9% with a very small voltage fading rate of 1.09 mV cycle&#8208;1  . This three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment strategy can suppress the voltage decay and capacity fading of LLOs for possible practicability in the near future.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson Phase Lead&#8208;free Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaic with Improved Stability</title>
      <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional Sn&#8208;based perovskites exhibit excellent oxidation and moisture resistance, which play an irreplaceable role in lead&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaic devices. Herein, 1,4&#8208;butanediamine (BEA) is incorporated into FASnI  3  (FA = formamidinium), developing a new series of low&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson (LDDJ) phase perovskite of (BEA)FA  n&#8208;1  Sn  n  I  3n+1  , which promote the expansion of new low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free perovskite. The broadness of representative (BEA)FA  2  Sn  3  I  10  bandgap appears to be softly influenced by the structural distortion due to high symmetry. The introduction of BEA ligand stabilizes the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure (formation energy &#8776; 10  6  j/mol), which inhibits the oxidation of Sn  2+  . In addition, the compact (BEA)FA  2  Sn  3  I  10  dominated film enables a weakened carrier localization mechanism with charge transfer time is only 0.36 ps among the quantum wells, which resulting in carrier diffusion length over 450 nm for electrons and 340 nm for holes, respectively. Solar cell fabrication with (BEA)FA  2  Sn  3  I  10  delivers a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.43% with negligible hysteresis. Particularly, the devices can retain over 90% (&lt; 60% for FASnI  3  devices) of their initial PCEs after 1000 h without encapsulation under N  2  environment and attenuate by 12% (vanish for FASnI  3  devices within 72 h) of their initial PCEs under ambient atmospheric condition for 200 h.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Substitution in BiO2&#8722;x for Efficient Molecular&#8208;Oxygen Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual defects: Introducing dual defects (surface oxygen vacancies and bulk oxygen substitution) in cubic BiO2&#8722;x was found to lead to a spatial and electronic synergistic process in photocatalytic molecular O2 activation. Oxygen substitution can induce a local electric field to promote bulk separation of electrons and holes, and oxygen vacancies serve as capture centers for electrons to facilitate the adsorption and activation of O2 (see picture).







Abstract
Defects in nanomaterials often lead to properties that are absent in their pristine counterparts. To date, most studies have focused on the effect of single defects, while ignoring the synergy of multiple defects. In this study, a model of photocatalytic O2 activation was selected to unravel the role of dual defects by decorating bismuth oxide with surface O vacancies and bulk O substitution simultaneously. The introduction of dual defects led to a spatial and electronic synergistic process: i)&#8197;O substitution induced a local electric field in the bulk of BiO2&#8722;x, which promoted bulk separation of electrons and holes immediately after their generation; ii)&#8197;O vacancies efficiently lowered the conduction band, served as the capture center for electrons, and thus facilitated the adsorption and activation of O2. This effect was greatly promoted by the coexistence of bulk O substitution, and DFT calculations showed that only O substitution near an O vacancy could have this effect.

      <title>A Convergent Total Synthesis of the Death Cap Toxin &#945;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A new route to the toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is presented. The key steps of the convergent [5+1+2]&#8208;synthesis are the preformation of the thioether building block and access to the enantiomerically pure non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on a multigram scale. The peptide fragment based methodology is the first convergent &#945;&#8208;amanitin synthesis fully performed in solution phase.







Abstract
The toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is mostly found in different species of the mushroom genus Amanita, with the death cap (Amanita phalloides) as one of the most prominent members. Due to its high selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II, which is directly linked to its high toxicity, particularly to hepatocytes, &#945;&#8208;amanitin received an increased attention as a toxin&#8208;component of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADC) in cancer research. Furthermore, the isolation of &#945;&#8208;amanitin from mushrooms as the sole source severely restricts compound supply as well as further investigations, as structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Based on a straightforward access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid dihydroxyisoleucine, we herein present a robust total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amanitin providing options for production at larger scale as well as future structural diversifications.

      <title>Metal Alkyls with Alkylidynic Metal&#8211;Carbon Bond Character: Key Electronic Structures in Alkane Metathesis Precatalysts.</title>
      <dc:description>The homologation of alkanes via alkane metathesis is catalyzed at low temperatures (150 &#176;C) by the silica&#8208;supported species&#160; (SiO)WMe  5  and&#160;&#160;(SiO)TaMe  4  , while (SiO)TaMe  3  Cp* is inactive. The contrasting reactivity is paralleled by differences in&#160;  13  C NMR signature; the former display significantly more deshielded isotropic chemical shifts (&#948;  iso  ) and almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensors, similar to what is observed in their molecular precursors TaMe  5  and WM  6  . Analysis of the chemical shift tensors reveals the presence of a triple&#8208;bond character in their metal&#8208;carbon (formally single) bond. This electronic structure is reflected in their propensity to generate alkylidynes and to participate in alkane metathesis, further supporting that alkylidynes are key reaction intermediates in that reaction.

      <title>Total Synthesis of Pyrolaside B:&#160;PhenolTrimerization via Sequenced Oxidative C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A facile method to oxidatively trimerize phenols using a low loading catalytic aerobic copper system is described. The mechanism of this transformation is probed, an understanding of which enabled cross coupling trimerizations. With this method, the natural product pyrolaside B has been synthesized for the first time. The key strategy used for this novel synthesis is the facile one&#8208;step construction of a spiroketal trimer intermediate which can be selectively reduced to give the natural product framework without recourse to stepwise Ullmann&#8208; and Suzuki&#8208;type couplings. As a result, pyrolaside B can be obtained expeditiously in five steps and 16% overall yield. Two other analogues were synthesized highlighting the utility of the method and new accessibility to this range of chemical space. A novel xanthene was also synthesized through controlled Lewis acid promoted rearrangement of a spiroketal trimer.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8208;MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single&#8208;Site Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Boron&#8208;containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron&#8208;containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous&#160;B2(OH)2xO(3 &#8211; x)&#160;(x = 0 &#8208; 3)&#160;layer. Yet, the precise nature of the active site(s) remains elusive. In this communication, we provide a detailed characterization of zeolite MCM&#8208;22 isomorphously substituted with boron (B&#8208;MWW). Using&#160;11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B&#8208;MWW exist as isolated BO3&#160;units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B&#8208;MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site&#8208;isolated BO3&#160;units are the active site in boron&#8208;based catalysts. This observation is at odds with other traditionally studied catalysts like vanadium&#8208;based catalysts and provides an important piece of the mechanistic puzzle.</dc:description>

      <title>Semisynthetic and enzyme&#8208;mediated conjugate preparations illuminate the ubiquitination&#8208;dependent aggregation of protein tau</title>
      <dc:description>In the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, the regulatory protein ubiquitin is found conjugated to different lysine residues of protein tau assembled into pathological paired helical filaments. To shed light on the hitherto unexplored ubiquitination&#8208;linked conformational transitions of tau, the availability of&#160;  in vitro  &#160;ubiquitin conjugation methods is of primary importance. In our work, we focused on the four&#8208;repeat domain of tau and assembled an enzymatic machinery formed by UBE1, Ubc13, and CHIP enzymes. The enzymatic reaction resulted in monoubiquitination at multiple sites, reminiscent of the ubiquitination pattern observed&#160;  in vivo  . We further exploited chemoselective disulfide coupling reactions to construct three tau regioisomers with site&#8208;specific monoubiquitination. Protein aggregation experiments revealed that the multiple enzyme&#8208;derived products were unable to convert into amyloid fibrils, while the semisynthetic conjugates exhibited diverse capability to form filaments. This study contributes novel insight into the effects of a key post&#8208;translational modification on aberrant protein self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

      <title>General Strategy for Synthesis of Ordered Pt3M Intermetallics with Ultrasmall Particle&#8208;size</title>
      <dc:description>Controllable synthesis of atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial to obtain superior electrocatalytic performance for fuel cell reactions, but still remains arduous.  Herein, we demonstrate  a novel and general hydrogel&#8208;freeze drying strategy  for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (  rGO  ) supported Pt  3  M (M= Mn, Cr, Fe and Co etc.) intermetallic NPs (Pt  3  M/rGO&#8208;HF) with ultrasmall particle&#8208;size (about 3 nm) and dramatic monodispersity. The formation of hydrogel prevents the aggregation of graphene oxide and significantly promotes their excellent dispersion, while a freeze&#8208;drying can retain the hydrogel derived three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) porous structure and immobilize the metal precursors with defined atomic ratio on GO support during solvent sublimation, which is not afforded by traditional oven drying. The subsequent annealing process produces rGO supported ultra&#8208;small ordered Pt  3  M intermetallic NPs (~3 nm) due to confinement effect of 3D porous structure.  Such Pt  3  M intermetallic NPs exhibit the smallest particle size among the reported ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts.  A detailed study of the synthesis of ordered intermetallic Pt  3  Mn/rGO catalyst is provided as an example of a generally applicable method. This study provides an economical and scalable route for the controlled synthesis of Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts, which can pave a way for the commercialization of fuel cell technologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous and Segmented Semiconducting Fiber&#8208;like Nanostructures with Spatially Selective Functionalization by Living Crystallization&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer of oligo( p  &#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208; b  &#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (OPV 5  &#8208; b  &#8208;P2VP 44  , the subscripts represent the mean number of repeat units of each block), in which the basicity and coordinating/chelating ability of the P2VP segment provide a landscape for the incorporation of a variety of functional inorganic NPs. Through a self&#8208;seeding strategy, we were able to prepare monodisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles of OPV 5  &#8208; b  &#8208;P2VP 44  with lengths ranging from 50 to 800 nm. Significantly, the exposed two ends of OPV core of these fiber&#8208;like micelles remained active toward further epitaxial deposition of OPV 5  &#8208; b  &#8208;PNIPAM 49  (PNIPAM = poly( N  &#8208;isopropylacrylamide)) and OPV 5  &#8208; b  &#8208;P2VP 44  to generate uniform A&#8208;B&#8208;A and B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B segmented block comicelles with tunable lengths for each block. The P2VP domains in these (co&#8208;)micelles can be selectively decorated with diverse inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles as well as metal oxide coatings, to afford uniform hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures.

      <dc:description>Structure&#8208;based drug development is often hampered by the lack of in vivo activity of promising compounds screened in vitro, due to low membrane permeability or poor intracellular binding selectivity. Here we show that ligand screening can be performed in living human cells by &#8216;intracellular protein&#8208;observe&#8217; NMR, without requiring enzymatic activity measurements or other cellular assays.

The approach was applied to carbonic anhydrase and, in principle, can be extended to any NMR&#8208;observable intracellular target.

      <title>A Periodic System of Supramolecular Elements</title>
      <dc:description>The Periodic Table of Chemical Elements is the most important concept in chemistry. Atoms are combined by covalent chemical bonds to form molecules. However, there is also a chemistry &#8220;beyond the molecule&#8221;. This chemistry is based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions, which are more than one order of magnitude weaker than covalent chemical bonds and thereby reversible in nature. As a consequence of these weak non&#8208;covalent bonds, structural organization by folding and self&#8208;assembly can only be fully exploited with molecules of a larger size which can provide multiple binding sites such as those present in natural biomacromolecules, e.g. proteins and RNA. With significant advances in synthetic methodologies, analytical techniques, and computational chemistry over the last two decades, today&#8217;s chemists are now able to synthesize such &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and to predict folding into desired conformations. With this advancing knowledge a new level of chemistry can be realized by the creation of non&#8208;natural entities composed of molecular building blocks with defined secondary structures. Herein we define these building blocks as supramolecular elements. It is our vision that the increasing number of newly developed supramolecular elements will enable sophisticated nanodevices that match the amazing biomolecular machinery found in cells. As the combination of atoms into molecules has established the chemistry of today, supramolecular elements and their combination will establish the chemistry of tomorrow. We anticipate that the research on such large molecules will reveal construction principles dictated by recurring motifs that govern structure formation by folding and self&#8208;assembly. These principles are comparable to the organization of atoms by their periodic properties related to electron configuration in the Peridic Table of Chemical Elements. These organization principles may therefore lead to the establishment of a Periodic System of Supramolecular Elements.</dc:description>

With significant advances in synthetic methodologies, analytical techniques, and computational chemistry over the last two decades, today&#8217;s chemists are now able to synthesize such &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and to predict folding into desired conformations. With this advancing knowledge a new level of chemistry can be realized by the creation of non&#8208;natural entities composed of molecular building blocks with defined secondary structures. Herein we define these building blocks as supramolecular elements. It is our vision that the increasing number of newly developed supramolecular elements will enable sophisticated nanodevices that match the amazing biomolecular machinery found in cells. As the combination of atoms into molecules has established the chemistry of today, supramolecular elements and their combination will establish the chemistry of tomorrow. We anticipate that the research on such large molecules will reveal construction principles dictated by recurring motifs that govern structure formation by folding and self&#8208;assembly. These principles are comparable to the organization of atoms by their periodic properties related to electron configuration in the Peridic Table of Chemical Elements. These organization principles may therefore lead to the establishment of a Periodic System of Supramolecular Elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Planar AIEgens with Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence and ROS&#8208;Generation for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Planar luminogens have encountered difficulties in overcoming intrinsic aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching by intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Although excited&#8208;state double&#8208;bond reorganization (ESDBR) can guide us on designing planar aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens), its mechanism has yet been elucidated.

In this study, we rationally developed fluoro&#8208;substituent AIEgens with stronger intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction for restricted molecular motions and increased crystal density, leading to decreased nonradiative decay rate by one order of magnitude. The adjusted ESDBR properties also show a corresponding response to variation in viscosity. Furthermore, their aggregation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations have been discovered. The application of such planar AIEgen in treating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria has been demonstrated in a mouse model.

      <title>Enhancing hydrogen evolution activity of Au(111) in alkaline media through molecular engineering of a 2D polymer</title>

      <title>Disentangling Catalytic Processes of Zeolites within Single Oriented Channels</title>
      <dc:description>Establishing structure&#8208;reactivity relationships is vital to developing superior materials for catalysis. It has been well studied in metal&#8208;based catalysts by designing metal nanoparticles with controlled active sites. However, it is rather difficult to achieve for microporous materials as their reactivities are determined by both the type of the active sites and their pores and/or cavities. Herein, a well&#8208;defined model system was developed to build structure&#8208;reactivity relationships for specific zeolite channel orientations during various catalytic reactions, namely methanol&#8208; and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH and ETH) processes as well as oligomerization reactions. The entrapped and effluent hydrocarbons from single oriented zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 channels during the MTH were monitored using  operando  UV&#8208;Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and online mass spectrometry (MS), respectively. The results reveal that the straight channels favor the formation of internal coke, promoting the aromatic cycle.

      <title>Electrophysiological characterization of transport across outer membrane channels from Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)</title>
      <dc:description>Multi&#8208;drug resistance in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is often associated with low permeability of the outer membrane. To investigate the role of membrane channels in the uptake of antibiotics here, we show a robust approach using fusion of native outer membrane vesicles (OMV) into planar lipid bilayer, which moreover allows also characterization of membrane protein channels in their native environment. Two major membrane channels from  E. coli  , OmpF and OmpC, were overexpressed from the host and the corresponding OMVs were collected. Each OMV fusion revealed surprisingly single or only a few channel activities. The asymmetry of the OMV&#180;s translates after fusion into the lipid membrane with the LPS dominantly present at the side of OMV addition. Compared to conventional reconstitution method, the channels fused from OMVs containing LPS have similar conductance but a much broader distribution and significantly lower permeation. We suggest using outer membrane vesicles as a fast and easy approach for functional and structural studies of membrane channels in the native membrane.</dc:description>

Two major membrane channels from  E. coli  , OmpF and OmpC, were overexpressed from the host and the corresponding OMVs were collected. Each OMV fusion revealed surprisingly single or only a few channel activities. The asymmetry of the OMV&#180;s translates after fusion into the lipid membrane with the LPS dominantly present at the side of OMV addition. Compared to conventional reconstitution method, the channels fused from OMVs containing LPS have similar conductance but a much broader distribution and significantly lower permeation. We suggest using outer membrane vesicles as a fast and easy approach for functional and structural studies of membrane channels in the native membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Spatially Controlled Supramolecular Polymerization of Peptide Nanotubes by Microfluidics</title>
      <dc:description>The recent advances in the supramolecular polymerization of synthetic building blocks in aqueous conditions has given rise to new artificial and biocompatible functional materials. However, despite the importance of spatially resolved self&#8208;assembly for natural and artificial molecular machines, the spatial control of supramolecular polymerization with synthetic monomers has not been experimentally established yet. Here we describe a microfluidic&#8208;regulated tandem process of supramolecular polymerization and droplet encapsulation to control the position of self&#8208;assembled microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes in water droplets. This method allowed the precise preferential localization of the fibres either at the interface or into the core of the droplets. UV absorbance, circular dichroism and fluorescence microscopy indicated that the microfluidic control of the stimuli (changes in pH or ionic strength) can be employed to adjust the packing degree and the spatial position of microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes. Additionally, this spatially organized supramolecular polymerization of peptide nanotubes was applied in the assembly of highly ordered two&#8208;dimensional droplet networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Prospect of Sulfurized Pyrolyzed Poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention S@pPAN: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.

Heterobifunctional rotaxanes serve as catalysts for the addition of malonates to Michael acceptors. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913781), J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al. report a series of heterobifunctional rotaxanes, featuring an amine&#8208;based thread and a chiral phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based macrocycle.

      <title>Production of Hydroxy Acids: Selective Double Oxidation of Diols by Flavoprotein Alcohol Oxidase</title>
      <dc:description>
Triple action: The flavoprotein alcohol oxidase (AOX*) facilitates the double and triple oxidations of diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. Such biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids has potential for the preparation of polyester building blocks.







Abstract
Flavoprotein oxidases can catalyze oxidations of alcohols and amines by merely using molecular oxygen as the oxidant, making this class of enzymes appealing for biocatalysis. The FAD&#8208;containing (FAD=flavin adenine dinucleotide) alcohol oxidase from P. chrysosporium facilitated double and triple oxidations for a range of aliphatic diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. For example, diethylene glycol could be selectively and fully converted into 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethoxy)acetic acid. Such a facile cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids opens up new avenues for the preparation of polyester building blocks.

      <title>Supracolloidal Self&#8208;Assembly of Divalent Janus 3D DNA Origami via Programmable Multivalent Host/Guest Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Combined forces: Adamantane and &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin functionalized 3D DNA origami Janus colloids are used for cooperative multivalent interaction enhancement of supramolecular host/guest interactions resulting in 1D&#8208;fibril formation. The merger of DNA nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry gives access to study multivalent effects at a colloidal level.







Abstract
We introduce divalent 3D DNA origami cuboids as truly monodisperse colloids and harness their ability for precision functionalization with defined patches and defined numbers of supramolecular binding motifs. We demonstrate that even adamantane/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin host/guest inclusion complexes of moderate association strength can induce efficient supracolloidal fibrillization at high dilution of the 3D DNA Origami as a result of cooperative multivalency. We show details on the assembly of Janus and non&#8208;Janus 3D DNA origami into supracolloidal homo&#8208; and heterofibrils with respect to multivalency effects, electrostatic screening, and stoichiometry. We believe that the merger of 3D DNA origami with colloidal self&#8208;assembly and supramolecular motifs provides new synergies at the interface of these disciplines to better understand multivalency effects, to promote structural complexity, and add non&#8208;DNA assembling and switching mechanisms to DNA nanoscience.

      <title>A Multiaction and Multitarget Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(IV) Conjugate Combining Cancer Activated Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy to Overcome Drug Resistant Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer has emerged as one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Pt(II) complexes are commonly used to treat this condition. To reduce their side effects and improve their pharmacological properties, Pt(IV) complexes are being developed as prodrug candidates that are activated by reduction in cancer cells. Concomitantly, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received increasing attention over the last years. Among other compounds studied as photosensitizers (PSs), Ru(II) polypyridine complexes have gained much attention over the recent years due to their attractive characteristics. In this article, the first example of a novel Pt(IV)&#8208;Ru(II) conjugate, which combines cancer activated chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy, is presented. Upon entering the cancer cell, the Pt(IV) centre is reduced to Pt(II) and the axial ligands including the Ru(II) complex and phenylbutyrate are released. As each component has its individual target, the conjugate exerts a multitarget and multiaction effect with (photo&#8208;)cytotoxicity values upon irradiation up to clinically relevant 595 nm in the low nanomolar range in various (drug resistant) 2D monolayer cancer cells and 3D multicellular tumour spheroids.</dc:description>

      <title>Protection strategies enable selective conversion of biomass</title>
      <dc:description>Selective and economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass components, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, to bio&#8208;based fuels and chemical, is the major goal of biorefineries but low yields and selectivities for fuel precurors such as sugars, furanics, and lignin&#8208;derived monomers pose significant disadvantages in process economics. It is widely recognized that a low selectivity results because degradation and/or condensation of biomass components occurs during its fractionation and conversion. Research efforts to minimize such undesirable side&#8208;reactions include optimization of reaction parameters and catalysts, equilibrium&#8208;controlled physical protection, and kinetic&#8208;controlled chemical protection. In most cases, the optimization of reaction parameters and catalysts has achieved limited selectivity improvements due to the parallel side&#8208;reactions associated with most of the biomass chemical conversion pathways. In this article, we summarized the existing protection strategies during biomass chemocatalytic conversion processes and focus the discussions on mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities of each strategy. We introduce a concept of using analogous methods to manipulate biomass catalytic conversion pathways during upgrading of carbohyrates to fuels and chemicals. We anticipate that this article may provide new insights into the development of selective biorefining processes from a different perspective, expanding the options for selective conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyhalogen and Polyinterhalogen Anions from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
      <dc:description>
The diverse field of polyhalogen anions and polyinterhalide chemistry is explored in terms of the structural diversity and chemical behavior of these anions as well as their applications. While the first anions of this class were described almost one hundred years ago, recent research has focused on the synthesis, structural diversity, and bonding of polyhalogen anions of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.







Abstract
This Review deals with the evolving field of polyhalogen chemistry, specifically polyhalogen anions (polyhalides). In addition to a historical outline, current progress in synthetic approaches towards the formation of polyfluorides, polychlorides, polybromides, and polyinterhalides is also illustrated. The structural diversity of polyhalides has substantially increased in the past decade, especially for polychlorides and polybromides, which are commonly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Polyfluorides have been examined by sophisticated state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and investigated spectroscopically in noble gas matrix&#8208;isolation experiments under cryogenic conditions at 4&#8197;K. The bonding in such polyhalide systems is also discussed. The last Section deals with applications of polyhalides in halogenation reactions and electrochemistry as well as their use as reactive ionic liquids, emphasizing the promising future of polyhalogen chemistry.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanomaterials for Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer therapy: Recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for photothermal therapy including their optical properties, synthesis methods, surface modification, and applications is reviewed. The unique properties and advantages of 2D nanomaterials have been successfully used in photothermal therapy and combined photothermal therapy. This application will continue to be attractive and need further exploration.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are currently explored as novel photothermal agents because of their ultrathin structure, high specific surface area, and unique optoelectronic properties. In addition to single photothermal therapy (PTT), 2D nanomaterials have demonstrated significant potential in PTT&#8208;based synergistic therapies. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for enhanced photothermal cancer therapy over the last five years. Their unique optical properties, typical synthesis methods, and surface modification are also covered. Emphasis is placed on their PTT and PTT&#8208;synergized chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. The major challenges of 2D photothermal agents are addressed and the promising prospects are also presented.

A shining duo: A pair of conjugated cyclophane enantiomers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Cyclo&#8208;NDIs, is reported. The spatial electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI is modulated by external stimuli such as the temperature and solvent polarity, resulting in large optical changes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based cyclophanes (Cyclo&#8208;NDIs) are reported. Each enantiomer of Cyclo&#8208;NDI exhibits a circularly polarized luminescence signal with a relatively large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3). We have further investigated the modulation of through&#8208;space electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented NDIs in a discrete Cyclo&#8208;NDI with changes in the temperature. Tuning of the electronic communication results from the conformational transformation of monomer&#8208; versus dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI, as confirmed by UV/Vis, fluorescence, circular dichroic, and NMR spectroscopic analysis. The temperature&#8208;dependent optical response in the Cyclo&#8208;NDI through the conformational transformation could be utilized as a highly sensitive and reversible optical thermometer in a wide temperature range (100 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C).

So far most reported HP&#8208;MOFs are prepared based on the generation of mesopores in microporous frameworks, and the formed mesopores are connected by microporous channels, limiting the accessibility of mesopores for bulky molecules seriously.

      <title>Formation and Characterization of a BeOBeC Multiple Radical Featuring a Quartet Carbyne Moiety</title>
      <dc:description>Through reaction of beryllium dimers with carbon monoxide, a carbonyl complex BeBeCO is formed in solid neon. Upon visible light excitation, the BeBeCO complex rearranges to a BeCOBe isomer, which further isomerizes to a low&#8208;energy BeOBeC species under UV&#8208;visible light excitation. These species are identified on the basis of infrared absorption spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical studies. The BeOBeC molecule is characterized to be a multiple radical species having an electronic quintet ground state featuring an unusual quartet carbyne unit with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center. Bonding analysis indicates that the strong Pauli repulsion between carbon 2s lone pair electrons and the &#963; electrons of the BeOBe fragment significantly weakens the Be&#8208;C bonding and destabilizes the triplet state of the BeOBeC radical with a doublet carbyne unit. The three&#8208;center &#960;&#8208;bonding of BeOBe is also found to play a role in stabilizing the quartet carbyne.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable DNA Origami Motors Translocate Ballistically Over &#956;m&#160;Distances at nm/s Speeds</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by biological motor proteins, that efficiently convert chemical fuel to unidirectional motion there has been considerable interest in developing synthetic analogues. Among the synthetic motors created thus far, DNA motors that undertake discrete steps on RNA tracks have shown the greatest promise. Nonetheless, DNA nanomotors lack intrinsic directionality, are low speed and take a limited number of steps prior to stalling or dissociation. Herein, we report the first example of a highly tunable DNA origami motor that moves linearly over micron distances at an average speed of 40 nm/min. Importantly, nanomotors move unidirectionally without intervention through an external force field or a patterned track. Because DNA origami enables precise testing of nanoscale structure&#8208;function relationships, we were able to experimentally study the role of motor shape, chassis flexibility, leg distribution, and total number of legs in tuning performance. An anisotropic rigid chassis coupled with a high density of legs maximizes nanomotor speed and endurance.</dc:description>

      <title>Encapsulation of a Porous Organic Cage into the Pores of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhanced CO2 Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile &#8220;host&#8208;in&#8208;host&#8221; approach has been utilized to prepare functional porous organic molecule based hybrid materials by encapsulating cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) cages into the nanospace of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The obtained CB6@MIL&#8208;101 composites are efficient porous adsorbents with enhanced CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 separation at low pressures.







Abstract
We present a facile approach to encapsulate functional porous organic cages (POCs) into a robust MOF by an incipient&#8208;wetness impregnation method. Porous cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) cages with high CO2 affinity were successfully encapsulated into the nanospace of Cr&#8208;based MIL&#8208;101 while retaining the crystal framework, morphology, and high stability of MIL&#8208;101. The encapsulated CB6 amount is controllable. Importantly, as the CB6 molecule with intrinsic micropores is smaller than the inner mesopores of MIL&#8208;101, more affinity sites for CO2 are created in the resulting CB6@MIL&#8208;101 composites, leading to enhanced CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 separation performance at low pressures. This POC@MOF encapsulation strategy provides a facile route to introduce functional POCs into stable MOFs for various potential applications.
