      <title>Refinement of Copper(II) Azide with 1&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;5H&#8208;Tetrazoles: Adaptable Energetic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A concept for stabilizing highly sensitive and explosive copper(II) azide with 1N&#8208;substituted tetrazoles is described. It was possible to stabilize the system by the use of high&#8208;nitrogen and highly endothermic ligands. The sensitivities of the resulting energetic copper coordination compounds can be tuned further by variation of the alkyl chain of the ligands or by phlegmatization of the complexes with classical additives during the synthesis. It is demonstrated, using the compound based on 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole ([Cu(N3)2(MTZ)], 1) that this class of complexes can be applied as a potential replacement for both lead azide (LA) and lead styphnate (LS). The complex was extensively investigated according to its chemical (EA, single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR, SEM) and physico&#8208;chemical properties (DTA, sensitivities towards impact, friction, and ESD) compared to pure copper(II) azide.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective

Synthesis of A Configurationally Stable S&#8208;Shaped Double

Helicene&#8208;Like Molecule</title>
      <dc:description>An S&#8208;shaped double helicene&#8208;like molecule (&gt;99% ee), possessing stable helical chirality, has been synthesized by the rhodium(I)/difluorphos complex&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intramolecular double [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a 2&#8208;naphthol&#8208; and benzene&#8208;linked hexayne. The collision between two terminal naphthalene rings destabilizes the helical chirality of the Sshaped double helicene&#8208;like molecule, but the introduction of two additional fused benzene rings significantly increases the configurational stability. Thus, no epimerization and racemization were observed even at 100 &#176;C. The enantiopure S&#8208;shaped double helicene&#8208;like molecule forms a trimer through the multiple C&#8211;H&#8230;&#960; and C&#8211;H&#8230;O interactions in the solid&#8208;state. The trimers stack to form columnar packing structures, in which neighboring stacks have opposite dipole directions. The accumulation of helical structures in the same direction in the S&#8208;shaped double helicene&#8208;like molecule enhanced the chiroptical properties (electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence).</dc:description>

      <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effect on Luminescence in Polymers: Advances and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong links: Polymers containing luminophores or sub&#8208;luminophores may display enhanced emission upon crosslinking by covalent, supramolecular, and ionic bonding, and by through&#8208;space interactions in confined domains. In this Minireview the theoretical background is discussed and numerous examples are provided, which may guide researchers in crosslinkage techniques to improve luminescent systems.







Abstract
The crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect was first proposed to explore the strong luminescence of nonconjugated polymer dots possessing only either non&#8208;emissive or weakly emissive sub&#8208;luminophores. Interesting phenomena in recent research indicate such enhancement caused by extensive crosslinking appears in diverse luminescent polymers with sub&#8208;luminophores (electron&#8208;rich heteroatomic moieties) or luminophores (conjugated &#960; domains). This enhancement can promote the emission from nonluminous to luminous, from weakly luminous to strongly luminous, and even convert the pathway of radiative transitions. The concept of the crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect should be updated and extended to an in&#8208;depth spatial effect, such as electron overlap and energy splitting in confined domains by effective crosslinking, more than initial immobilization. This Minireview outlines the development of the crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect from the perspective of the detailed classification, inherent mechanism and applicable systems. An outlook on the further exploration and application of this theory are also proposed.

      <title>Recent Progress in the Development of Solid&#8208;State Luminescent o&#8208;Carboranes with Stimuli Responsivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Shine on you crazy diamond! In this Minireview a series of arene&#8208;modified o&#8208;carboranes are described that display solid&#8208;state emission as well as stimuli&#8208;responsive optical properties. The unique photochemistry of these o&#8208;carboranes, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), twist&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer (TICT) emission, and solid&#8208;state excimer emission, is explored.







Abstract
o&#8208;Carborane, a cluster compound containing boron and adjacent carbon atoms, displays intriguing luminescent properties. Recently, compounds containing o&#8208;carborane units were found to show suppressed aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and intense solid&#8208;state emission; they also show potential for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminochromic materials. In this Minireview, we introduce three kinds of fundamental photochemical properties: aggregation&#8208;induced emission, twisted intramolecular charge transfer in crystals, and environment&#8208;sensitive excimer formation in solids. Based on these properties, several types of luminochromism, such as thermos&#8208;, vapo&#8208;, and mechanochromism, have been discovered. Based mainly on results from recent studies, we illustrate these mechanisms as well as unique luminescent behaviors of o&#8208;carborane derivatives.

      <title>New Promise and Opportunities for Allosteric Kinase Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Allosteric inhibition of kinase signaling is a promising approach for the targeted discovery of therapeutics with exceptional selectivity and the ability of overcoming the acquired resistance of the orthosteric ATP&#8208;binding site inhibitors. The recent developments of allosteric kinase inhibitors that bind outside the catalytic kinase domain further warrant considerable interest and offer unique opportunities in this area.







Abstract
Drugs that function through allosteric inhibition of kinase signaling represent a promising approach for the targeted discovery of therapeutics. The majority of developed allosteric kinase inhibitors are characterized as type III and IV inhibitors that show good kinome selectivity but generally lack the subtype selectivity of same kinase family. Recently allosteric inhibitors have been developed that bind outside the catalytic kinase domain with high selectivity for specific kinase subtypes. Allosteric inhibitors that bind to the pseudokinase domain of pseudokinase or the extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases are reviewed. We also review recent developments in the field of allosteric kinase inhibitors including examples of proteolysis targeting chimeras, and highlight the unique binding modes for each type of inhibitors and address future opportunities in this area.

      <title>Specific &#8220;Unlocking&#8221; of a Nanozyme&#8208;Based Butterfly Effect To Break the Evolutionary Fitness of Chaotic Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
Conquering chaos: IrOx nanoparticles were shown to possess acid&#8208;activated multienzyme&#8208;like properties, and further loading with glucose oxidase (GOD) created a nanozyme (IrOx&#8211;GOD) that mimicked four enzymes. The introduction of IrOx&#8211;GOD into chaotic tumors led to a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of initial starvation therapy and subsequent pressure of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) to completely disrupt the self&#8208;adaption of cancer cells (see picture).







Abstract
Chaos and the natural evolution of tumor systems can lead to the failure of tumor therapies. Herein, we demonstrate that iridium oxide nanoparticles (IrOx) possess acid&#8208;activated oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like functions and wide pH&#8208;dependent catalase&#8208;like properties. The integration of glucose oxidase (GOD) unlocked the oxidase and peroxidase activities of IrOx by the production of gluconic acid from glucose by GOD catalysis in cancer cells, and the produced H2O2 was converted into O2 to compensate its consumption in GOD catalysis owing to the catalase&#8208;like function of the nanozyme, thus resulting in the continual consumption of glucose and the self&#8208;supply of substrates to generate superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. Moreover, IrOx can constantly consume glutathione (GSH) by self&#8208;cyclic valence alternation of IrIV and IrIII. These cascade reactions lead to a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of initial starvation therapy and the subsequent pressure of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) to completely break the self&#8208;adaption of cancer cells.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Noble&#8208;Metal Chalcogenides and Phosphochalcogenides
</title>
      <dc:description>
The noble art: Noble&#8208;metal dichalcogenides and phosphochalcogenides are a novel class of two&#8208;dimensional materials. This Minireview summarizes the progress in their synthesis, characterization, and application, highlighting their unique structural features and relationships.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal chalcogenides, dichalcogenides, and phosphochalcogenides are an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional materials. Quantum confinement (number of layers) and defect engineering enables their properties to be tuned over a broad range, including metal&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor transitions, magnetic ordering, and topological surface states. They possess various polytypes, often of similar formation energy, which can be accessed by selective synthesis approaches. They excel in mechanical, optical, and chemical sensing applications, and feature long&#8208;term air and moisture stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in the field of noble&#8208;metal chalcogenides and phosphochalcogenides and highlight the structural complexity and its impact on applications.

      <title>Electrolyte Regulation towards Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Increased attention SPAN: Recent advances in electrolyte regulation towards stable lithium&#8208;metal anodes for Li&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries are summarized to afford design strategies of solvents, lithium salts, additives, and gel electrolyte.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are highly regarded as the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices because of their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is considered a promising sulfur cathode to substitute carbon/sulfur (C/S) composites to afford higher Coulombic efficiency, improved cycling stability, and potential high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. However, the instability of the Li&#8208;metal anode threatens the performances of Li&#8211;SPAN batteries bringing limited lifespan and safety hazards. Li&#8208;metal can react with most kinds of electrolyte to generate a protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), electrolyte regulation is a widely accepted strategy to protect Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries. Herein, the basic principles and current challenges of Li&#8211;SPAN batteries are addressed. Recent advances on electrolyte regulation towards stable Li&#8208;metal anodes in Li&#8211;SPAN batteries are summarized to suggest design strategies of solvents, lithium salts, additives, and gel electrolyte. Finally, prospects for future electrolyte design and Li anode protection in Li&#8211;SPAN batteries are discussed.

     alt="Electrolyte Regulation towards Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increased attention SPAN&lt;/b&gt;: Recent advances in electrolyte regulation towards stable lithium&#8208;metal anodes for Li&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries are summarized to afford design strategies of solvents, lithium salts, additives, and gel electrolyte.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are highly regarded as the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices because of their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is considered a promising sulfur cathode to substitute carbon/sulfur (C/S) composites to afford higher Coulombic efficiency, improved cycling stability, and potential high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. However, the instability of the Li&#8208;metal anode threatens the performances of Li&#8211;SPAN batteries bringing limited lifespan and safety hazards. Li&#8208;metal can react with most kinds of electrolyte to generate a protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), electrolyte regulation is a widely accepted strategy to protect Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries. Herein, the basic principles and current challenges of Li&#8211;SPAN batteries are addressed. Recent advances on electrolyte regulation towards stable Li&#8208;metal anodes in Li&#8211;SPAN batteries are summarized to suggest design strategies of solvents, lithium salts, additives, and gel electrolyte. Finally, prospects for future electrolyte design and Li anode protection in Li&#8211;SPAN batteries are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photocontrolled Dopamine Polymerization on DNA Origami with Nanometer Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>
When dopamine is photopolymerized on DNA origami, precisely patterned nanoobjects are obtained with unprecedented spatiotemporal control and nanometer resolution. This approach combines the advantages of visible light as an external stimulus and the unique addressability of the DNA origami methodology.







Abstract
Temporal and spatial control over polydopamine formation on the nanoscale can be achieved by installing an irradiation&#8208;sensitive polymerization system on DNA origami. Precisely distributed G&#8208;quadruplex structures on the DNA template serve as anchors for embedding the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX, which&#8212;upon irradiation with visible light&#8212;induces the multistep oxidation of dopamine to polydopamine, producing polymeric structures on designated areas within the origami framework. The photochemical polymerization process allows exclusive control over polydopamine layer formation through the simple on/off switching of the light source. The obtained polymer&#8211;DNA hybrid material shows significantly enhanced stability, paving the way for biomedical and chemical applications that are typically not possible owing to the sensitivity of DNA.

      <title>Large Deformation of a DNA&#8208;Origami Nanoarm Induced by the Cumulative Actuation of Tension&#8208;Adjustable Modules</title>
      <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;origami nanoarm capable of undergoing large but reversible conformational changes resulting from the cumulative action of serially repeated, tension&#8208;adjustable modules is constructed. This could enable the production of DNA nanodevices that change shape in response to external stimuli.







Abstract
Making use of the programmability and structural flexibility of the DNA molecule, a DNA&#8208;origami nanoarm capable of undergoing large deformation is constructed. This DNA&#8208;origami nanoarm comprised serially repeated tension&#8208;adjustable modules, the cumulative actuation of which resulted in a large deformation of the arm structure, which transformed from a linear shape into an arched shape. Combining atomic force microscopy and theoretical analyses based on the mechanics of materials, we demonstrate that the degree of deformation can be systematically controlled by merely replacing a set of strands that is required for the actuation of the module. Moreover, by employing a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence for the actuation, we could achieve reversible ion&#8208;induced contraction and relaxation of the nanoarm. The adjustability and scalability of this design could enable the production of DNA nanodevices that exhibit large deformation in response to external stimuli.

      <title>Total Synthesis of Tetrodotoxin</title>
      <dc:description>
A total synthesis of tetrodotoxin was accomplished. Construction of the cyclohexane core by a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was followed by stereoselective installation of hydroxy groups. A newly developed transformation of a terminal alkyne into a nitrile enabled introduction of an amino group. Oxidative cleavage of a 1,2&#8208;diol formed two aldehyde units, which were differentiated by nucleophilic attack of a guanidine moiety, leading to tetrodotoxin.







Abstract
A total synthesis of tetrodotoxin was accomplished. A Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between a known enone and a siloxy diene gave a tricyclic product, the steric bias of which was used to construct the remaining stereogenic centers. A nitrogen atom was introduced either by a four&#8208;step sequence involving a Curtius rearrangement, or a three&#8208;step sequence featuring a newly developed transformation of a terminal alkyne into a nitrile. Introduction of the guanidine moiety followed by the formation of the heterocyclic system by cascade reactions led to tetrodotoxin.

      <title>Engineering Iron&#8211;Nickel Nanoparticles for Magnetically Induced CO2 Methanation in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic Fe30Ni70 NPs were used as heating agent and catalysts for magnetically induced CO2. Upon deposition of Ni onto the NPs surface, full CO2 conversion into CH4 at low magnetic field was achieved.







Abstract
Induction heating of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) is a method to activate heterogeneous catalytic reactions. It requires nano&#8208;objects displaying high heating power and excellent catalytic activity. Here, using a surface engineering approach, bimetallic NPs are used for magnetically induced CO2 methanation, acting both as heating agent and catalyst. The organometallic synthesis of Fe30Ni70 NPs displaying high heating powers at low magnetic field amplitudes is described. The NPs are active but only slightly selective for CH4 after deposition on SiRAlOx owing to an iron&#8208;rich shell (25&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1, 25&#8197;mT, 300&#8197;kHz, conversion 71&#8201;%, methane selectivity 65&#8201;%). Proper surface engineering consisting of depositing a thin Ni layer leads to Fe30Ni70@Ni NPs displaying a very high activity for CO2 hydrogenation and a full selectivity. A quantitative yield in methane is obtained at low magnetic field and mild conditions (25&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1, 19&#8197;mT, 300&#8197;kHz, conversion 100&#8201;%, methane selectivity 100&#8201;%).

      <title>Cross&#8208;Linking between Sodalite Nanoparticles and Graphene Oxide in Composite Membranes to Trigger High Gas Permeance, Selectivity, and Stability in Hydrogen Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
Turning a SOD: Cross&#8208;linking between sodalite (SOD) nanoparticles having an aperture size of 2.9&#8197;&#197; with flexible 2D layers of graphene oxide (GO) in the membranes was achieved. This led to high gas permeance and enhanced selectivity towards hydrogen from a mixture containing CO2 and water.







Abstract
Thin membranes (900&#8197;nm) were prepared by direct transformation of infiltrated amorphous precursor nanoparticles, impregnated in a graphene oxide (GO) matrix, into hydroxy sodalite (SOD) nanocrystals. The amorphous precursor particles rich in silanols (Si&#8722;OH) enhanced the interactions with the GO, thus leading to the formation of highly adhesive and stable SOD/GO membranes via strong bonding. The cross&#8208;linking of SOD nanoparticles with the GO in the membranes promoted both the high gas permeance and enhanced selectivity towards H2 from a mixture containing CO2 and H2O. The SOD/GO membranes are moisture resistance and exhibit steady separation performance (H2 permeance of about 4900&#8197;GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 56, with no degradation in performance during the test of 50&#8197;h) at high temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) under water vapor (4&#8197;mol&#8201;%).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turning a SOD&lt;/b&gt;: Cross&#8208;linking between sodalite (SOD) nanoparticles having an aperture size of 2.9&#8197;&#197; with flexible 2D layers of graphene oxide (GO) in the membranes was achieved. This led to high gas permeance and enhanced selectivity towards hydrogen from a mixture containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thin membranes (900&#8197;nm) were prepared by direct transformation of infiltrated amorphous precursor nanoparticles, impregnated in a graphene oxide (GO) matrix, into hydroxy sodalite (SOD) nanocrystals. The amorphous precursor particles rich in silanols (Si&#8722;OH) enhanced the interactions with the GO, thus leading to the formation of highly adhesive and stable SOD/GO membranes via strong bonding. The cross&#8208;linking of SOD nanoparticles with the GO in the membranes promoted both the high gas permeance and enhanced selectivity towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from a mixture containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The SOD/GO membranes are moisture resistance and exhibit steady separation performance (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of about 4900&#8197;GPU and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 56, with no degradation in performance during the test of 50&#8197;h) at high temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) under water vapor (4&#8197;mol&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards Long&#8208;Term Photostability of Nickel Hydroxide/BiVO4 Photoanodes for Oxygen Evolution Catalysts via In&#8197;Situ Catalyst Tuning</title>
      <dc:description>
Flex your PECs: A facile plasma etching approach was utilized to reduce both interface/surface recombination at NiOOH/BiVO4 and NiOOH/electrolyte junctions for photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis of water splitting. Addition of Fe2+ into the borate buffer electrolyte alleviated the active but unstable character of etched&#8208;NiOOH/BiVO4, leading to an outstanding photostability over 200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Increasing long&#8208;term photostability of BiVO4 photoelectrode is an important issue for solar water splitting. The NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) has fast water oxidation kinetics compared to the FeOOH OEC. However, it generally shows a lower photoresponse and poor stability because of the more substantial interface recombination at the NiOOH/BiVO4 junction. Herein, we utilize a plasma etching approach to reduce both interface/surface recombination at NiOOH/BiVO4 and NiOOH/electrolyte junctions. Further, adding Fe2+ into the borate buffer electrolyte alleviates the active but unstable character of etched&#8208;NiOOH/BiVO4, leading to an outstanding oxygen evolution over 200&#8197;h. The improved charge transfer and photostability can be attributed to the active defects and a mixture of NiOOH/NiO/Ni in OEC induced by plasma etching. Metallic Ni acts as the ion source for the in&#8197;situ generation of the NiFe OEC over long&#8208;term durability.

      <title>Photocontrolled Synthesis of n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers
</title>
      <dc:description>
Teaching an old Grignard new tricks: Electron&#8208;poor Grignard monomers can be photopolymerized to form n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. The investigations show that the polymerization proceeds via chain growth, molecular weight can be tuned through the irradiation wavelength, and all&#8208;conjugated block copolymers can be synthesized in one pot by selective irradiation.







Abstract
Current approaches to synthesize &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) are dominated by thermally driven, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated reactions. Herein we show that electron&#8208;deficient Grignard monomers readily polymerize under visible&#8208;light irradiation at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst. The product distribution can be tuned by the wavelength of irradiation based on the absorption of the polymer. Conversion studies are consistent with an uncontrolled chain&#8208;growth process; correspondingly, chain extension produces all&#8208;conjugated n&#8208;type block copolymers. Preliminary results demonstrate that the polymerization can be expanded to donor&#8211;acceptor alternating copolymers. We anticipate that this method can serve as a platform to access new architectures of n&#8208;type CPs without the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

      <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Induces Bicyclizations that Tolerate Electron&#8208;Rich and Electron&#8208;Deficient Intermediate Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) initiates bicyclization reactions involving either electron&#8208;rich or electron&#8208;poor internal alkenes and electron&#8208;rich arene terminators. The method provides a diversity of complex polycyclic products. Mechanistic investigations are also discussed.







Abstract
A novel CoII&#8208;catalyzed polyene cyclization was developed that is uniquely effective when performed in hexafluoroisopropanol as the solvent. The process is presumably initiated by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (MHAT) to 1,1&#8208;disubstituted or monosubstituted alkenes, and the reaction is remarkable for its tolerance of internal alkenes bearing either electron&#8208;rich methyl or electron&#8208;deficient nitrile substituents. Electron&#8208;rich aromatic terminators are required in both cases. Terpenoid scaffolds with different substitution patterns are obtained with excellent diastereoselectivities, and the bioactive C20&#8208;oxidized abietane diterpenoid carnosaldehyde was made to showcase the utility of the nitrile&#8208;bearing products. Also provided are the results of several mechanistic experiments that suggest the process features an MHAT&#8208;induced radical bicyclization with late&#8208;stage oxidation to regenerate the aromatic terminator.

      <title>Understanding the Activity of Co&#8208;N4&#8722;xCx in Atomic Metal Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
The activity of Co&#8208;N4&#8722;xCx with a tunable coordination environment is investigated as the active sites for oxygen reduction reaction catalysis. The defect on carbon is essential for the formation of Co&#8208;N4&#8722;xCx. N coordinated with Co manipulates reactivity by modification of electronic distribution and N traps more Co to increase the number of active sites.







Abstract
Atomic metal catalysis (AMC) provides an effective way to enhance activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Cobalt anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have been extensively reported. The carbon&#8208;hosted Co&#8208;N4 structure was widely considered as the active site; however, it is very rare to investigate the activity of Co partially coordinated with N, for example, Co&#8208;N4&#8722;xCx. Herein, the activity of Co&#8208;N4&#8722;xCx with tunable coordination environment is investigated as the active sites for ORR catalysis. The defect (di&#8208;vacancies) on carbon is essential for the formation of Co&#8208;N4&#8722;xCx. N species play two important roles in promoting the intrinsic activity of atomic metal catalyst: N coordinated with Co to manipulate the reactivity by modification of electronic distribution and N helped to trap more Co to increase the number of active sites.

&#956;&#8208;Opioid receptors (&#956;&#8208;ORs) play a critical role in the modulation of pain and mediate the effects of the most powerful analgesic drugs. Despite extensive efforts, it remains insufficiently understood how &#956;&#8208;ORs produce specific effects in living cells. We developed new fluorescent ligands based on the &#956;&#8208;OR antagonist E&#8208;p&#8208;nitrocinnamoylamino&#8208;dihydrocodeinone (CACO), that display high affinity, long residence time and pronounced selectivity. Using these ligands, we achieved single&#8208;molecule imaging of &#956;&#8208;ORs on the surface of living cells at physiological expression levels. Our results reveal a high heterogeneity in the diffusion of &#956;&#8208;ORs, with a relevant immobile fraction. Using a pair of fluorescent ligands of different color, we provide evidence that &#956;&#8208;ORs interact with each other to form short&#8208;lived homodimers on the plasma membrane. This approach provides a new strategy to investigate &#956;&#8208;OR pharmacology at single&#8208;molecule level.

      <title>Cation Diffusion Guides Hybrid Halide Perovskite Crystallization during the Gel Stage</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed lead halide perovskites often suffer from phase segregation. This phenomenon correlates to the cation diffusion kinetics at the gel stage. Now, a homogenous 2D perovskite thin film was successfully fabricated without significant phase segregation. This understanding should guide the design and processing of halide perovskites to meet the requirements for optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites with mixed cations/anions often suffer from phase segregation, which is detrimental to device efficiency and their long&#8208;term stability. During perovskite film growth, the gel stage (in between liquid and crystalline) correlates to phase segregation, which has been rarely explored. Herein, cation diffusion kinetics are systematically investigated at the gel stage to develop a diffusion model obeying Fick's second law. Taking 2D layered perovskite as an example, theoretical and experimental results reveal the impact of diffusion coefficient, temperature, and gel duration on the film growth and phase formation. A homogenous 2D perovskite thin film was then fabricated without significant phase segregation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of gel stage and relevant cation diffusion kinetics would further guide the design and processing of halide perovskites with mixed composition to meet requirements for optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Chimeric LuxR Transcription Factors Rewire Natural Product Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed signals: Modular LuxR&#8208;type transcriptional activator proteins can be engineered to alter the signals to which they respond. This enables the rewiring of quorum&#8208;sensing systems, and the resultant chimeric LuxRs can be applied for the activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters. In this way, the novel natural product pseudomonol was identified from a bacterium of the genus Pseudomonas.







Abstract
LuxR&#8208;type transcriptional activator proteins frequently regulate the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). With only a fraction of bacterial BGCs being expressed under standard culturing conditions, modulation of LuxRs would provide a powerful approach to activate silent clusters. We show that by exploiting the modular nature of LuxR proteins, it is possible to construct functional chimeric LuxRs, which enables both the rewiring of quorum sensing systems and the activation of silent BGCs. Importantly, our strategy allowed us to identify the novel natural product pseudomonol from a bacterium of the genus Pseudomonas.

Take your vitamins: The alpha isoform of folate receptor (FR&#8208;&#945;) is overexpressed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells.

Abstract
Folate receptors (FRs) are membrane proteins involved in folic acid uptake, and the alpha isoform (FR&#8208;&#945;) is overexpressed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. For fluorescence imaging of FRs in&#8197;vivo, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (650&#8211;900&#8197;nm), in which tissue penetration is high and autofluorescence is low, is optimal, but existing NIR fluorescent probes targeting FR&#8208;&#945; show high non&#8208;specific tissue adsorption, and require prolonged washout to visualize tumors. We have designed and synthesized a new NIR fluorescent probe, FolateSiR&#8208;1, utilizing a Si&#8208;rhodamine fluorophore having a carboxy group at the benzene moiety, coupled to a folate ligand moiety through a negatively charged tripeptide linker. This probe exhibits very low background fluorescence and afforded a tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) of up to 83 in FR&#8208;expressing tumor&#8208;bearing mice within 30&#8197;min. Thus, FolateSiR&#8208;1 has the potential to contribute to the research in the field of biology and the clinical medicine.

Halide&#8208;based materials are an important part of high&#8208;performance electrode materials as well as stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and new battery types, including magnesium, aluminum, halide&#8208;ion, metal&#8208;halogen, and liquid&#8208;metal batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art halide&#8208;based materials in rechargeable batteries are reviewed, with a focus on challenges and perspectives.







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are considered one of the most effective energy storage technologies to bridge the production and consumption of renewable energy. The further development of rechargeable batteries with characteristics such as high energy density, low cost, safety, and a long cycle life is required to meet the ever&#8208;increasing energy&#8208;storage demands. This Review highlights the progress achieved with halide&#8208;based materials in rechargeable batteries, including the use of halide electrodes, bulk and/or surface halogen&#8208;doping of electrodes, electrolyte design, and additives that enable fast ion shuttling and stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces, as well as realization of new battery chemistry. Battery chemistry based on monovalent cation, multivalent cation, anion, and dual&#8208;ion transfer is covered. This Review aims to promote the understanding of halide&#8208;based materials to stimulate further research and development in the area of high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. It also offers a perspective on the exploration of new materials and systems for electrochemical energy storage.

      <title>A Smart, Autocatalytic, DNAzyme Biocircuit for in&#8197;Vivo, Amplified, MicroRNA Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
An autocatalytic circuit is constructed for in&#8197;vivo fluorescence/molecular resonance imaging based on a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and DNAzyme biocatalysis, sustained by a honeycomb MnO2 nanosponge (hMNS). The hMNS was not only used to deliver the DNA, but also to supply the DNAzyme with Mn2+ as a cofactor. This system was used to detect microRNA in&#8197;vivo and shows great promise in cancer diagnosis.







Abstract
DNAzymes have been recognized as promising transducing agents for visualizing endogenous biomarkers, but their inefficient intracellular delivery and limited amplification capacity (including insufficient cofactor supply) preclude their extensive biological application. Herein, an autocatalytic DNAzyme (ACD) biocircuit is constructed for amplified microRNA imaging in&#8197;vivo based on a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and DNAzyme biocatalysis, sustained by a honeycomb MnO2 nanosponge (hMNS). The hMNS not only delivers DNA probes, but also supplies Mn2+ as a DNAzyme cofactor and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agent. Through the subsequent cross&#8208;activation of HCR and DNAzyme amplicons, the ACD amplifies the limited signal resulting from miRNA recognition. The hMNS/ACD system was used to image microRNA in&#8197;vivo, thus demonstrating its great promise in cancer diagnosis.

      <title>Tandem Anionic oxy&#8208;Cope Rearrangement/Oxygenation Reactions as a Versatile Method for Approaching Diverse Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>
Roller coaster to cyclopentanes: A unique tandem reaction consisting of anionic oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement and single&#8208;electron transfer (SET)&#8208;induced radical &#945;&#8208;oxygenation provides &#948;,&#1013;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;(aminoxy) carbonyl compounds, which serve as convenient precursors for all&#8208;carbon 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig and other radical cyclizations based on the persistent radical effect.







Abstract
Tandem anionic oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement/radical oxygenation reactions provide &#948;,&#1013;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;(aminoxy) carbonyl compounds, which serve as convenient precursors to diverse compound classes. Functionalized carbocycles are accessible by very rare all&#8208;carbon 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclizations, but also common 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclizations, based on the persistent radical effect. The tandem reactions can be further extended by highly diastereoselective allylation or reduction steps to give complex scaffolds.

      <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Macfarlandin C, a Spongian Diterpenoid Harboring a Concave&#8208;Substituted cis&#8208;Dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanone Fragment</title>
      <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of the rearranged spongian diterpenoid (&#8722;)&#8208;macfarlandin&#8197;C is reported. The strategy involves a late&#8208;stage fragment coupling between a tertiary carbon radical and an electrophilic butenolide resulting in the stereoselective formation of vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters.







Abstract
The enantioselective total synthesis of the rearranged spongian diterpenoid (&#8722;)&#8208;macfarlandin&#8197;C is reported. This is the first synthesis of a rearranged spongian diterpenoid in which the bulky hydrocarbon fragment is joined via a quaternary carbon to the highly hindered concave face of the cis&#8208;2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. The strategy involves a late&#8208;stage fragment coupling between a tertiary carbon radical and an electrophilic butenolide resulting in the stereoselective formation of vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters. A stereoselective Mukaiyama hydration that orients a pendant carboxymethyl side chain cis to the bulky octahydronapthalene substituent was pivotal in fashioning the challenging concave&#8208;substituted cis&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanone fragment.

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes: High Sterically Derived Selectivity from a Pyridyl&#8208;Imidazoline Ligand
</title>
      <dc:description>
Silylation of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes occurs with high sterically derived regioselectivity when catalyzed by the combination of [Ir(cod)(OMe)]2 and a novel pyridyl&#8208;imidazoline ligand. The silylation reactions produce high yields of heteroarylsilanes under conditions in which the borylation of C&#8722;H bonds with previously reported catalysts formed mixtures of products or products that are unstable.







Abstract
The steric effects of substituents on five&#8208;membered rings are less pronounced than those on six&#8208;membered rings because of the difference in bond angles. Thus, the regioselectivities of reactions of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes that occur with selectivities dictated by steric effects, such as the borylation of C&#8722;H bonds, have been poor in many cases. We report that the silylation of five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring heteroarenes occurs with high sterically derived regioselectivity when catalyzed by the combination of [Ir(cod)(OMe)]2 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) and a phenanthroline ligand or a new pyridyl&#8208;imidazoline ligand that further increases the regioselectivity. The silylation reactions with these catalysts produce high yields of heteroarylsilanes from functionalization at the most sterically accessible C&#8722;H bonds of these rings under conditions that the borylation of C&#8722;H bonds with previously reported catalysts formed mixtures of products or products that are unstable. The heteroarylsilane products undergo cross&#8208;coupling reactions and substitution reactions with ipso selectivity to generate heteroarenes that bear halogen, aryl, and perfluoroalkyl substituents.

      <title>Photodriven Active Ion Transport Through a Janus Microporous Membrane</title>
      <dc:description>
About face: A reduced graphene oxide/conjugated microporous polymer (rGO/CMP) Janus microporous membrane was fabricated, which capitalizes on the high mass transport efficiency of a microporous membrane and the efficient electron&#8211;hole separation of a Janus architecture. Photoinduced electron&#8211;hole separation generates a transmembrane potential that drives active and directional ion transport.







Abstract
Precise control of ion transport is a fundamental characteristic for the sustainability of life. It remains a great challenge to develop practical and high&#8208;performance artificial ion&#8208;transport system that can allow active transport of ions (protons) in an all solid&#8208;state nanoporous material. Herein, we develop a Janus microporous membrane by combining reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) for controllable photodriven ion transport. Upon light illumination, a net ionic current is generated from the CMP to the rGO side of the membrane, indicating that the rGO/CMP Janus membrane can realize photodriven directional and anti&#8208;gradient ion transport. Analogously to the p&#8208;n junction in photovoltaic devices, light is firstly converted into separated charges to trigger a transmembrane potential, which subsequently drives directional ion movement. For the first time, this method enables integration of a photovoltaic effect with an ionic field to drive active ion transport. With the advantages of scaled up production and easy fabrication, the concept of photovoltaic ion transport based on Janus microporous membrane may find wide application in energy storage and conversion, photodriven ion&#8208;sieving, and water treatment.

      <title>Biogenic Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles to Enable Extracellular Electron Uptake in Sulfate&#8208;Reducing Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Conductive iron sulfide nanoparticles (FeS NPs) were biosynthesized by sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria extracellularly, intracellularly, and on the cell surface. These FeS NPs enabled cells of direct electron uptake from an extracellular electrode coupled with metabolic energy production, providing critical insights into the physiological and biogeochemical role of naturally abundant FeS NPs.







Abstract
Microbes synthesize cell&#8208;associated nanoparticles (NPs) and utilize their physicochemical properties to produce energy under unfavorable metabolic conditions. Iron sulfide (FeS) NPs are ubiquitous and are predominantly biosynthesized by sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria (SRB). However, the biological role of FeS NPs in SRB remains understudied. Now, conductive FeS NPs function is demonstrated as an electron conduit enabling Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, an SRB strain, to utilize solid&#8208;state electron donors via direct electron uptake. After forming FeS NPs on the cell surface, D. vulgaris initiated current generation coupled with sulfate reduction on electrodes poised at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V versus standard hydrogen electrode. Single&#8208;cell activity analysis showed that the electron uptake and metabolic rate via FeS NPs in D. vulgaris were about sevenfold higher than those via native cell&#8208;surface proteins in other SRB.

      <title>Highly Crystalline and Semiconducting Imine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers Enabled by Interfacial Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Three crystalline imine&#8208;based 2D polymer films are prepared by surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS). The synthetic PI&#8208;2DP films feature polycrystalline multilayers with tunable thickness from 6 to 200&#8197;nm and large crystalline domains (100&#8211;150&#8197;nm in size) and exhibit p&#8208;type semiconductor behavior with a band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Single&#8208;layer and multi&#8208;layer 2D polyimine films have been achieved through interfacial synthesis methods. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve the maximum degree of crystallinity in the 2D polyimines, which largely limits the long&#8208;range transport properties. Here we employ a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) method for the successful preparation of porphyrin and triazine containing polyimine&#8208;based 2D polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) films with square and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The synthetic PI&#8208;2DP films are featured with polycrystalline multilayers with tunable thickness from 6 to 200&#8197;nm and large crystalline domains (100&#8211;150&#8197;nm in size). Intrigued by high crystallinity and the presence of electroactive porphyrin moieties, the optoelectronic properties of PI&#8208;2DP are investigated by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy. Typically, the porphyrin&#8208;based PI&#8208;2DP 1 film exhibits a p&#8208;type semiconductor behavior with a band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV and hole mobility as high as 0.01&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, superior to the previously reported polyimine based materials.

      <title>Clarification of Decomposition Pathways in a State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Lithium Ion Battery Electrolyte through 13C&#8208;Labeling of Electrolyte Components</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermal and electrochemical degradation reactions of a common lithium ion battery electrolyte (ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate + LiPF6) were investigated by using isotope labeling studies. Reaction pathways are postulated as well as a fragmentation mechanism assumption for oligomeric compounds depicted.







Abstract
The decomposition of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium ion battery (LIB) electrolytes leads to a highly complex mixture during battery cell operation. Furthermore, thermal strain by e.g., fast charging can initiate the degradation and generate various compounds. The correlation of electrolyte decomposition products and LIB performance fading over life&#8208;time is mainly unknown. The thermal and electrochemical degradation in electrolytes comprising 1&#8201;m LiPF6 dissolved in 13C3&#8208;labeled ethylene carbonate (EC) and unlabeled diethyl carbonate is investigated and the corresponding reaction pathways are postulated. Furthermore, a fragmentation mechanism assumption for oligomeric compounds is depicted. Soluble decomposition products classes are examined and evaluated with liquid chromatography&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry. This study proposes a formation scheme for oligo phosphates as well as contradictory findings regarding phosphate&#8208;carbonates, disproving monoglycolate methyl/ethyl carbonate as the central reactive species.

      <title>Inside Cover: Biogenic Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles to Enable Extracellular Electron Uptake in Sulfate&#8208;Reducing Bacteria (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 15/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron sulfide nanoparticles (FeS NPs) mediate bacterial extracellular electron uptake from solid electron donors. In their Research Article on page&#8197;5995, A. Okamoto et&#8197;al. demonstrate that self&#8208;synthesized FeS NPs on the cell surface enable sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria to extract electrons from electrodes, coupled with metabolic activation. The result sheds light on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, iron, and sulfur and the anaerobic corrosion mechanism.

      <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Homolytic Dissociation of Propyne on a Reduced Ceria Surface</title>
      <dc:description>
The adsorption of propyne on oxidized and reduced CeO2(111) surfaces has been studied by IR spectroscopy in combination with DFT. Propyne dissociates on a reduced ceria surface only through a heterolytic pathway to give methylacetylide and hydroxy species. However, water decreases the energy barrier and induces a homolytic dissociation of propyne.







Abstract
The emergence of ceria (CeO2) as an efficient catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes has attracted great attention. Intensive research effort has been devoted to understanding the underlying catalytic mechanism, in particular the H2&#8211;CeO2 interaction. Herein, we show that the adsorption of propyne (C3H4) on ceria, another key aspect in the hydrogenation of propyne to propene, strongly depends on the degree of reduction of the ceria surface and hydroxylation of the surface, as well as the presence of water. The dissociation of propyne and the formation of methylacetylide (CH3CC&#8208;) have been identified through the combination of infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and DFT calculations. We demonstrate that propyne undergoes heterolytic dissociation on the reduced ceria surface by forming a methylacetylide ion on the oxygen vacancy site and transferring a proton to the nearby oxygen site (OH group), while a water molecule that competes with the chemisorbed methylacetylide at the vacancy site assists the homolytic dissociation pathway by rebounding the methylacetylide to the nearby oxygen site.

      <title>How Lewis Acids Catalyze Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Expect the unexpected! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal that Lewis acids accelerate Diels&#8211;Alder reactions by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the reactants. This novel physical mechanism for the textbook Diels&#8211;Alder reaction challenges the wide&#8208;held belief that the Lewis acids lower the LUMO energy of the dienophile and, in that way, make them more reactive toward the diene.







Abstract
The Lewis acid(LA)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between isoprene and methyl acrylate was investigated quantum chemically using a combined density functional theory and coupled&#8208;cluster theory approach. Computed activation energies systematically decrease as the strength of the LA increases along the series I2&lt;SnCl4&lt;TiCl4&lt;ZnCl2&lt;BF3&lt;AlCl3. Emerging from our activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital bonding analysis was an unprecedented finding, namely that the LAs accelerate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction by a diminished Pauli repulsion between the &#960;&#8208;electron systems of the diene and dienophile. Our results oppose the widely accepted view that LAs catalyze the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction by enhancing the donor&#8211;acceptor [HOMOdiene&#8211;LUMOdienophile] interaction and constitute a novel physical mechanism for this indispensable textbook organic reaction.

      <title>Reversible pH&#8208;Responsive Coacervate Formation in Lipid Vesicles Activates Dormant Enzymatic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The pH responsiveness of a polycation above and below its pKa is used to drive liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form coacervate droplets within lipid vesicles. This is reversible as the coacervate droplets can be disassembled by increasing the pH above the pKa. pH&#8208;triggered coacervation in the presence of low concentrations of enzymes activates dormant reactions as the local enzyme and substrate concentrations are increased in the coacervate droplets which concomitantly changes the local environment of enzymes and reactants.







Abstract
In&#8197;situ, reversible coacervate formation within lipid vesicles represents a key step in the development of responsive synthetic cellular models. Herein, we exploit the pH responsiveness of a polycation above and below its pKa, to drive liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation, to form single coacervate droplets within lipid vesicles. The process is completely reversible as coacervate droplets can be disassembled by increasing the pH above the pKa. We further show that pH&#8208;triggered coacervation in the presence of low concentrations of enzymes activates dormant enzyme reactions by increasing the local concentration within the coacervate droplets and changing the local environment around the enzyme. In conclusion, this work establishes a tunable, pH responsive, enzymatically active multi&#8208;compartment synthetic cell. The system is readily transferred into microfluidics, making it a robust model for addressing general questions in biology, such as the role of phase separation and its effect on enzymatic reactions using a bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology approach.

      <title>The Application of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Reagents in Structural Proteomics</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of mass spectrometry and chemical labeling has become a powerful approach in structural proteomics. Fluorine substitution enables the development of a wide range of biocompatible reagents for interrogating the high&#8208;order structure and functions of proteins. This Minireview focuses on the application of fluorine&#8208;containing reagents in structural proteomics.







Abstract
Structural proteomics refers to large&#8208;scale mapping of protein structures in order to understand the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function. Chemical labeling, in combination with mass&#8208;spectrometry (MS) analysis, have emerged as powerful tools to enable a broad range of biological applications in structural proteomics. The key to success is a biocompatible reagent that modifies a protein without affecting its high&#8208;order structure. Fluorine, well&#8208;known to exert profound effects on the physical and chemical properties of reagents, should have an impact on structural proteomics. In this Minireview, we describe several fluorine&#8208;containing reagents that can be applied in structural proteomics. We organize their applications around four MS&#8208;based techniques: a)&#8197;affinity labeling, b)&#8197;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP), c)&#8197;protein footprinting, and d)&#8197;protein cross&#8208;linking. Our aim is to provide an overview of the research, development, and application of fluorine&#8208;containing reagents in protein structural studies.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanomaterials for Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer therapy: Recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for photothermal therapy including their optical properties, synthesis methods, surface modification, and applications is reviewed. The unique properties and advantages of 2D nanomaterials have been successfully used in photothermal therapy and combined photothermal therapy. This application will continue to be attractive and needs further exploration.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are currently explored as novel photothermal agents because of their ultrathin structure, high specific surface area, and unique optoelectronic properties. In addition to single photothermal therapy (PTT), 2D nanomaterials have demonstrated significant potential in PTT&#8208;based synergistic therapies. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for enhanced photothermal cancer therapy over the last five years. Their unique optical properties, typical synthesis methods, and surface modification are also covered. Emphasis is placed on their PTT and PTT&#8208;synergized chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. The major challenges of 2D photothermal agents are addressed and the promising prospects are also presented.

     alt="Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanomaterials for Photothermal Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer therapy&lt;/b&gt;: Recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for photothermal therapy including their optical properties, synthesis methods, surface modification, and applications is reviewed. The unique properties and advantages of 2D nanomaterials have been successfully used in photothermal therapy and combined photothermal therapy. This application will continue to be attractive and needs further exploration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are currently explored as novel photothermal agents because of their ultrathin structure, high specific surface area, and unique optoelectronic properties. In addition to single photothermal therapy (PTT), 2D nanomaterials have demonstrated significant potential in PTT&#8208;based synergistic therapies. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for enhanced photothermal cancer therapy over the last five years. Their unique optical properties, typical synthesis methods, and surface modification are also covered. Emphasis is placed on their PTT and PTT&#8208;synergized chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. The major challenges of 2D photothermal agents are addressed and the promising prospects are also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embedding Ultrasmall Au Clusters into the Pores of a Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photostability and Photocatalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Building bridges: A covalent organic framework (COF) was modified with thiol chains as nucleation sites for gold nanoclusters (NCs) in its pores. The Au&#8211;S&#8211;COF bridges in the resulting photocatalyst increased charge&#8208;separation efficiency (see picture). Furthermore, the ultrasmall pores of the COF and the strong S&#8211;Au binding energy combined to improve the dispersibility of Au NCs and their photostability under prolonged illumination.







Abstract
Gold clusters loaded on various supports have been widely used in the fields of energy and biology. However, the poor photostability of Au clusters on support interfaces under prolonged illumination usually results in loss of catalytic performance. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with periodic and ultrasmall pore structures are ideal supports for dispersing and stabilizing Au clusters, although it is difficult to encapsulate Au clusters in the ultrasmall pores. In this study, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF modified with thiol chains in its pores was prepared. With &#8722;SH groups as nucleation sites, Au nanoclusters (NCs) could grow in situ within the COF. The ultrasmall pores of the COF and the strong S&#8722;Au binding energy combine to improve the dispersibility of Au NCs under prolonged light illumination. Interestingly, Au&#8211;S&#8211;COF bridging as observed in this artificial Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic system is deemed to be an ideal means to increase charge&#8208;separation efficiency.

      <title>Enhancing Multicomponent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Low Pressure Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Separations</title>
      <dc:description>
The hydrocarbon adsorption behavior of multicomponent MOFs with contoured pore environments is explored. Contrary to conventional wisdom, i.e., that adsorptive interactions with larger hydrocarbon guests are dominated by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, it is found that contoured aliphatic pore environments can exhibit high selectivity and capacity at low pressures.







Abstract
The resurgence of interest in the hydrogen economy could hinge on the distribution of hydrogen in a safe and efficient manner. Whilst great progress has been made with cryogenic hydrogen storage or liquefied ammonia, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) remain attractive due to their lack of need for cryogenic temperatures or high pressures, most commonly a cycle between methylcyclohexane and toluene. Oxidation of methylcyclohexane to release hydrogen will be more efficient if the equilibrium limitations can be removed by separating the mixture. This report describes a family of six ternary and quaternary multicomponent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that contain the three&#8208;dimensional cubane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (cdc) ligand. Of these MOFs, the most promising is a quaternary MOF (CUB&#8208;30), comprising cdc, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdc) and tritopic truxene linkers. Contrary to conventional wisdom that adsorptive interactions with larger, hydrocarbon guests are dominated by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, here we report that contoured aliphatic pore environments can exhibit high selectivity and capacity for LOHC separations at low pressures. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, where selective adsorption for cyclohexane over benzene is witnessed, underlining the unique adsorptive behavior afforded by the unconventional cubane moiety.

      <title>Fast Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminomethylation of Alkenes and the Formal Conversion of Methylamine</title>
      <dc:description>
Methylamine can be coupled to alkenes by using a titanium hydroaminoalkylation catalyst that is inexpensive (1&#8197;&#8364;/g) and easily accessible. Compatibility of methylamine with the catalyst is achieved by silylation; the products can be isolated with the protective group intact or, through simple deprotection with water, as the free amine.







Abstract
The scientific interest in catalytic hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkenes has vastly increased over the past decade, but these reactions have struggled to become a viable option for general laboratory or industrial use because of reaction times of several days. The titanium&#8208;based catalytic system introduced in this work not only reduces the reaction time by several orders of magnitude, into the range of minutes, but the catalyst is also demonstrated to be easily available from common starting materials, at a cost of approximately 1&#8197;&#8364; per millimole of catalyst. We were also able to formally perform C&#8722;H activation of methylamine and achieve coupling to a broad variety of alkenes, through silyl protection of the amine and simple deprotection by water.

      <title>Rapid, Label&#8208;free Optical Spectroscopy Platform for Diagnosis of Heparin&#8208;Induced Thrombocytopenia</title>
      <dc:description>
Clinical detection of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an immune&#8208;related complication of heparin therapy, presents a formidable challenge. A capillary&#8208;tube&#8208;derived surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic platform enables the accurate recognition of this pathology by the label&#8208;free and rapid analysis of patient sera.







Abstract
The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to determine spectral markers for the diagnosis of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;diagnose immune&#8208;related complication that often leads to limb ischemia and thromboembolism, is proposed. The ability to produce distinct molecular signatures without the addition of labels enables unbiased inquiry and makes SERS an attractive complementary diagnostic tool. A capillary&#8208;tube&#8208;derived SERS platform offers ultrasensitive, label&#8208;free measurement as well as efficient handling of blood serum samples. This shows excellent reproducibility, long&#8208;term stability and provides an alternative diagnostic rubric for the determination of HIT by leveraging machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based classification of the spectroscopic data. We envision that a portable Raman instrument could be combined with the capillary&#8208;tube&#8208;based SERS analytical tool for diagnosis of HIT in the clinical laboratory, without perturbing the existing diagnostic workflow.

      <title>A Cofactor&#8208;Substrate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Fluorescent Probe for the Ultrafast Detection of Nitroreductase under Hypoxic Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Caged cofactors: A cofactor&#8208;substrate&#8208;based supramolecular probe strategy for ultrafast (within seconds) and quantitative detection of nitroreductase under hypoxic conditions is proposed. The probe promotes enzyme efficiency by altering the substrate catalytic process and enhances the electron transfer efficiency through an intra&#8208;molecular pathway with increased activity.







Abstract
Identifying the location and expression levels of enzymes under hypoxic conditions in cancer cells is vital in early&#8208;stage cancer diagnosis and monitoring. By encapsulating a fluorescent substrate, L&#8208;NO2, within the NADH mimic&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic capsule Zn&#8208;MPB, we developed a cofactor&#8208;substrate&#8208;based supramolecular luminescent probe for ultrafast detection of hypoxia&#8208;related enzymes in solution in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. The host&#8211;guest structure fuses the coenzyme and substrate into one supramolecular probe to avoid control by NADH, switching the catalytic process of nitroreductase from a double&#8208;substrate mechanism to a single&#8208;substrate one. This probe promotes enzyme efficiency by altering the substrate catalytic process and enhances the electron transfer efficiency through an intra&#8208;molecular pathway with increased activity. The enzyme content and fluorescence intensity showed a linear relationship and equilibrium was obtained in seconds, showing potential for early tumor diagnosis, biomimetic catalysis, and prodrug activation.

&lt;/b&gt;, within the NADH mimic&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic capsule Zn&#8208;&lt;b&gt;MPB&lt;/b&gt;, we developed a cofactor&#8208;substrate&#8208;based supramolecular luminescent probe for ultrafast detection of hypoxia&#8208;related enzymes in solution in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. The host&#8211;guest structure fuses the coenzyme and substrate into one supramolecular probe to avoid control by NADH, switching the catalytic process of nitroreductase from a double&#8208;substrate mechanism to a single&#8208;substrate one. This probe promotes enzyme efficiency by altering the substrate catalytic process and enhances the electron transfer efficiency through an intra&#8208;molecular pathway with increased activity. The enzyme content and fluorescence intensity showed a linear relationship and equilibrium was obtained in seconds, showing potential for early tumor diagnosis, biomimetic catalysis, and prodrug activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stable Prenucleation Calcium Carbonate Clusters Define Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
A quantitative, general model for liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is introduced based on &#8220;nonclassical&#8221; nucleation via prenucleation clusters. Potentiometric titrations and stopped&#8208;flow ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy verify the predictive power of the model for the aqueous calcium carbonate system. This model reconciles the previously inconsistent literature values for the solubilities of amorphous calcium carbonates.







Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an intermediate step during the precipitation of calcium carbonate, and is assumed to play a key role in biomineralization processes. Here, we have developed a model where ion association thermodynamics in homogeneous phases determine the liquid&#8211;liquid miscibility gap of the aqueous calcium carbonate system, verified experimentally using potentiometric titrations, and kinetic studies based on stopped&#8208;flow ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy. The proposed mechanism explains the variable solubilities of solid amorphous calcium carbonates, reconciling previously inconsistent literature values. Accounting for liquid&#8211;liquid amorphous polymorphism, the model also provides clues to the mechanism of polymorph selection. It is general and should be tested for systems other than calcium carbonate to provide a new perspective on the physical chemistry of LLPS mechanisms based on stable prenucleation clusters rather than un&#8208;/metastable fluctuations in biomineralization, and beyond.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photochemical Reduction of CO2 to CO Coupled to Hydrocarbon Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>
The coupling of CO2 photoreduction to photodehydrogenation of cyclohexene was promoted by a three&#8208;component construct consisting of graphitic carbon nitride as a visible&#8208;light photoactive semiconductor and a polyoxometalate that functions as an electron acceptor to improve hole&#8211;electron charge separation and also acts as an electron donor to a rhenium&#8208;based CO2&#8208;reduction catalyst.







Abstract
Research on the photochemical reduction of CO2, initiated already 40&#8197;years ago, has with few exceptions been performed by using amines as sacrificial reductants. Hydrocarbons are high&#8208;volume chemicals whose dehydrogenation is of interest, so the coupling of a CO2 photoreduction to a hydrocarbon&#8208;photodehydrogenation reaction seems a worthwhile concept to explore. A three&#8208;component construct was prepared including graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) as a visible&#8208;light photoactive semiconductor, a polyoxometalate (POM) that functions as an electron acceptor to improve hole&#8211;electron charge separation, and an electron donor to a rhenium&#8208;based CO2 reduction catalyst. Upon photoactivation of g&#8208;CN, a cascade is initiated by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons coupled to the reduction of the polyoxometalate. Visible&#8208;light photoexcitation of the reduced polyoxometalate enables electron transfer to the rhenium&#8208;based catalyst active for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. The construct was characterized by zeta potential, IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS). An experimental Z&#8208;scheme diagram is presented based on electrochemical measurements and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The conceptual advance should promote study into more active systems.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Structure&#8208;Directed Metal&#8211;Organic Zeolite&#8208;like Networks as Biomacromolecule Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>
Caught in a trap: Proteins are used to direct the formation of new zeolitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that encapsulate the template proteins under ambient conditions. Histidines in the proteins play a crucial role in directing the formation of these MOFs. The MOF&#8208;encapsulated proteins retain their activity even after exposure to high temperature and organic solvents.







Abstract
Fabrication of zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) for advanced applications, such as enzyme immobilization, is of great interest but is a great synthetic challenge. Herein, we have developed a new strategy using proteins as structure&#8208;directed agents to direct the formation of new ZMOFs that can act as versatile platforms for the in&#8197;situ encapsulation of proteins under ambient conditions. Notably, protein incorporation directs the formation of a ZMOF with a sodalite (sod) topology instead of a non&#8208;porous diamondoid (dia) topology under analogous synthetic conditions. Histidines in proteins play a crucial role in the observed templating effect. Modulating histidine content thereby influenced the resultant MOF product (from dia to dia + sod mixture and, ultimately, to sod MOF). Moreover, the resulting ZMOF&#8208;incorporated proteins preserved their activity even after exposure to high temperatures and organic solvents, demonstrating their potential for biocatalysis and biopharmaceutical applications.

      <title>Determination of Complex Small&#8208;Molecule Structures Using Molecular Alignment Simulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A quantitative correlation between the atomic structure of the alignment medium, the molecular structure of a small molecule, and molecule&#8208;specific anisotropic NMR parameters has been established that predicts residual dipolar couplings of small molecules aligned by poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate). These molecular alignment simulations allow determination of the relative configurations of small molecules from extremely sparse NMR data.







Abstract
Correct structural assignment of small molecules and natural products is critical for drug discovery and organic chemistry. Anisotropy&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the structural assignment of organic molecules, but it relies on the utilization of a medium that disrupts the isotropic motion of molecules in organic solvents. Here, we establish a quantitative correlation between the atomic structure of the alignment medium, the molecular structure of the small molecule, and molecule&#8208;specific anisotropic NMR parameters. The quantitative correlation uses an accurate three&#8208;dimensional molecular alignment model that predicts residual dipolar couplings of small molecules aligned by poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate). The technique facilitates reliable determination of the correct stereoisomer and enables unequivocal, rapid determination of complex molecular structures from extremely sparse NMR data.

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Oxocarbenium Ions: A Case of Ionic Hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>
It's ionic: Reported here is an iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of oxocarbenium ions to afford chiral isochromans with high enantioselectivities. In the presence of a catalytic amount of the Br&#248;nsted acid HCl, an &#945;&#8208;chloroether is generated in situ and subsequentially reduced. A discussion of the kinetics and the reaction mechanism is included.







Abstract
Ionic hydrogenation has not been extensively explored, but is advantageous for challenging substrates such as unsaturated intermediates. Reported here is an iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of oxocarbenium ions to afford chiral isochromans with high enantioselectivities. A variety of functionalities are compatible with this catalytic system. In the presence of a catalytic amount of the Br&#248;nsted acid HCl, an &#945;&#8208;chloroether is generated in situ and subsequentially reduced. Kinetic studies suggest first&#8208;order kinetics in the substrate and half&#8208;order kinetics in the catalyst. A positive nonlinear effect, together with the half kinetic order, revealed a dimerization of the catalyst. Possible reaction pathways based on the monomeric iridium catalyst were proposed and DFT computational studies revealed an ionic hydrogenation pathway. Chloride abstraction and the cleavage of dihydrogen occur in the same step.

Reported here is an iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of oxocarbenium ions to afford chiral isochromans with high enantioselectivities. A variety of functionalities are compatible with this catalytic system. In the presence of a catalytic amount of the Br&#248;nsted acid HCl, an &#945;&#8208;chloroether is generated in situ and subsequentially reduced. Kinetic studies suggest first&#8208;order kinetics in the substrate and half&#8208;order kinetics in the catalyst. A positive nonlinear effect, together with the half kinetic order, revealed a dimerization of the catalyst. Possible reaction pathways based on the monomeric iridium catalyst were proposed and DFT computational studies revealed an ionic hydrogenation pathway. Chloride abstraction and the cleavage of dihydrogen occur in the same step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Remote Participation during Glycosylation Reactions of Galactose Building Blocks: Direct Evidence from Cryogenic Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Remote control: The structure of glycosyl cations involved in remote participation is unraveled by using cryogenic ion IR spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory. The acetyl groups at C4 promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;products by forming a covalent bond to the anomeric carbon atom in dioxolenium&#8208;type ions.







Abstract
The stereoselective formation of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds is challenging. However, 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;selectivity can be induced by remote participation of C4 or C6 ester groups. Reactions involving remote participation are believed to proceed via a key ionic intermediate, the glycosyl cation. Although mechanistic pathways were postulated many years ago, the structure of the reaction intermediates remained elusive owing to their short&#8208;lived nature. Herein, we unravel the structure of glycosyl cations involved in remote participation reactions via cryogenic vibrational spectroscopy and first principles theory. Acetyl groups at C4 ensure &#945;&#8208;selective galactosylations by forming a covalent bond to the anomeric carbon in dioxolenium&#8208;type ions. Unexpectedly, also benzyl ether protecting groups can engage in remote participation and promote the stereoselective formation of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds.

      <title>Environment&#8208;Recognizing DNA&#8208;Computation Circuits for the Intracellular Transport of Molecular Payloads for mRNA Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Framework nucleic acid (FNA) nanocarriers controlled by a DNA&#8208;computation circuit are designed for the delivery of molecular payloads in living cells in response to various stimuli and are used for mRNA imaging.







Abstract
Programming intelligent DNA nanocarriers for the targeted transport of molecular payloads in living cells has attracted extensive attention. In&#8197;vivo activation of these nanocarriers usually relies on external light irradiation. An interest is emerging in the automatic recognition of intracellular surroundings by nanocarriers and their in&#8197;situ activation under the control of programmed DNA&#8208;computation circuits. Herein, we report the integration of DNA circuits with framework nucleic acid (FNA) nanocarriers that consist of a truncated square pyramid (TSP) cage and a built&#8208;in duplex cargo containing an antisense strand of the target mRNA. An i&#8208;motif and ATP aptamer embedded in the TSP are employed as logic&#8208;controlling units to respond to H+ and ATP inside cellular compartments, triggering the release of the sensing element for fluorescent mRNA imaging. Logic&#8208;controlled FNA devices could be used to target drug delivery, enabling precise disease treatment.

      <title>Encapsulation of a Porous Organic Cage into the Pores of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhanced CO2 Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile &#8220;host&#8208;in&#8208;host&#8221; approach has been utilized to prepare functional porous organic molecule based hybrid materials by encapsulating cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) cages into the nanospace of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The obtained CB6@MIL&#8208;101 composites are efficient porous adsorbents with enhanced CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 separation at low pressures.







Abstract
We present a facile approach to encapsulate functional porous organic cages (POCs) into a robust MOF by an incipient&#8208;wetness impregnation method. Porous cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) cages with high CO2 affinity were successfully encapsulated into the nanospace of Cr&#8208;based MIL&#8208;101 while retaining the crystal framework, morphology, and high stability of MIL&#8208;101. The encapsulated CB6 amount is controllable. Importantly, as the CB6 molecule with intrinsic micropores is smaller than the inner mesopores of MIL&#8208;101, more affinity sites for CO2 are created in the resulting CB6@MIL&#8208;101 composites, leading to enhanced CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 separation performance at low pressures. This POC@MOF encapsulation strategy provides a facile route to introduce functional POCs into stable MOFs for various potential applications.

      <title>Molecular Fluorescence Imaging Spectroscopy for Mapping Low Concentrations of Red Lake Pigments: Van&#8197;Gogh's Painting The Olive Orchard</title>
      <dc:description>
Looking for eosin: In&#8197;situ mapping of fugitive red lake pigments (eosin and carmine lakes) in a van&#8197;Gogh painting was achieved with molecular fluorescence imaging spectroscopy. The high sensitivity of this method enabled lower concentrations of red lakes to be detected than by elemental X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging spectroscopy.







Abstract
Vincent van&#8197;Gogh used fugitive red lake pigments that have faded in some paintings. Mapping their distribution is key to understanding how his paintings have changed with time. While red lake pigments can be identified from microsamples, in&#8197;situ identification and mapping remain challenging. This paper explores the ability of molecular fluorescence imaging spectroscopy to identify and, more importantly, map residual non&#8208;degraded red lakes. The high sensitivity of this method enabled identification of the emission spectra of eosin (tetrabromine fluorescein) lake mixed with lead or zinc white at lower concentrations than elemental X&#8208;ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy used on account of bromine. The molecular fluorescence mapping of residual eosin and two carmine red lakes in van&#8197;Gogh's The Olive Orchard is demonstrated and compared with XRF imaging spectroscopy. The red lakes are consistent with the composition of paint tubes known to have been used by van&#8197;Gogh.

      <title>The Biosynthesis of the Benzoxazole in Nataxazole Proceeds via an Unstable Ester and has Synthetic Utility</title>
      <dc:description>
Benzoxazole biosynthesis, a key step in the biosynthesis of the antitumor agent nataxazole, proceeds via a hemiorthoamide intermediate that arises from an unstable ester. NatL2 catalyzes the formation of this ester that spontaneously rearranges into an off&#8208;pathway amide. In the presence of NatAM, the ester is converted to benzoxazole via a hemiorthoamide intermediate. These enzymes are used to synthesize a series of novel halogenated benzoxazoles.







Abstract
Heterocycles, a class of molecules that includes oxazoles, constitute one of the most common building blocks in current pharmaceuticals and are common in medicinally important natural products. The antitumor natural product nataxazole is a model for a large class of benzoxazole&#8208;containing molecules that are made by a pathway that is not characterized. We report structural, biochemical, and chemical evidence that benzoxazole biosynthesis proceeds through an ester generated by an ATP&#8208;dependent adenylating enzyme. The ester rearranges via a tetrahedral hemiorthoamide to yield an amide, which is a shunt product and not, as previously thought, an intermediate in the pathway. A second zinc&#8208;dependent enzyme catalyzes the formation of hemiorthoamide from the ester but, by shuttling protons, the enzyme eliminates water, a reverse hydrolysis reaction, to yield the benzoxazole and avoids the amide. These insights have allowed us to harness the pathway to synthesize a series of novel halogenated benzoxazoles.

      <title>Controlling Single Molecule Conductance by a Locally Induced Chemical Reaction on Individual Thiophene Units</title>
      <dc:description>
The conductance of single molecules is controlled and increased by a stimulated chemical reaction forming covalent bonds between the reacting molecular unit and surface atoms. The reaction path is determined on the atomic scale by scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy. The results are supported by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Among the prerequisites for the progress of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based electronic devices are a better understanding of the electronic properties at the individual molecular level and the development of methods to tune the charge transport through molecular junctions. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is an ideal tool not only for the characterization, but also for the manipulation of single atoms and molecules on surfaces. The conductance through a single molecule can be measured by contacting the molecule with atomic precision and forming a molecular bridge between the metallic STM tip electrode and the metallic surface electrode. The parameters affecting the conductance are mainly related to their electronic structure and to the coupling to the metallic electrodes. Here, the experimental and theoretical analyses are focused on single tetracenothiophene molecules and demonstrate that an in situ&#8208;induced direct desulfurization reaction of the thiophene moiety strongly improves the molecular anchoring by forming covalent bonds between molecular carbon and copper surface atoms. This bond formation leads to an increase of the conductance by about 50&#8201;% compared to the initial state.

      <title>High Ethylene Selectivity in Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefin (MTO) Reaction over MOR&#8208;Zeolite Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
MOR is more: A multilamellar MOR&#8208;type zeolite with highly exposed (010) crystal planes was prepared using a specially designed bifunctional amphiphilic surfactant, which favored the more selective production of ethylene in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction.







Abstract
Precisely controlled crystal growth endows zeolites with special textural and catalytic properties. A nanosheet mordenite zeolite with a thickness of ca. 11&#8197;nm, named as MOR&#8208;NS, has been prepared using a well&#8208;designed gemini&#8208;type amphiphilic surfactant as bifunctional structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA). Its benzyl diquarternary ammonium cations structurally directed the formation of MOR topology, whereas the long and hydrophobic hexadecyl tailing group prevented the extensive crystal growth along b&#8197;axis. This kind of orientated crystallization took place through the inorganic&#8211;organic interaction between silica species and SDA molecules present in the whole process. The thin MOR nanosheets, with highly exposed (010) planes and 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) windows, exhibited a much improved ethylene selectivity (42.1&#8201;%) for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions when compared with conventional bulk MOR crystals (3.3&#8201;%).

      <title>Primary Anion&#8211;&#960; Catalysis of Epoxide&#8208;Opening Ether Cyclization into Rings of Different Sizes: Access to New Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>
New interactions in catalysis are expected to provide access to new products from known reactions. For anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis, new mechanisms for epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclization have been discovered, but result in the same products as those from conventional Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Now, disfavored large ring oxepanes and oxocanes (yellow) are accessible on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces.







Abstract
The concept of anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis focuses on the stabilization of anionic transition states on aromatic &#960; surfaces. Recently, we demonstrated the occurrence of epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclizations on aromatic &#960; surfaces. Although the reaction proceeded through unconventional mechanisms, the obtained products are the same as those from conventional Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, and in agreement with the Baldwin selectivity rules. Different mechanisms, however, should ultimately lead to new products, a promise anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis has been reluctant to live up to. Herein, we report non&#8208;trivial reactions that work with anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis, but not with Br&#248;nsted acids, under comparable conditions. Namely, we show that the anion&#8211;&#960; templated autocatalysis and epoxide opening with alcoholate&#8211;&#960; interactions can provide access to unconventional ring chemistry. For smaller rings, anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis affords anti&#8208;Baldwin oxolanes, 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanes, and the expansion of Baldwin oxetanes by methyl migration. For larger rings, anion&#8211;&#960; templated autocatalysis is thought to alleviate the entropic penalty of folding to enable disfavored anti&#8208;Baldwin cyclizations into oxepanes and oxocanes.

Carbon monoxide is used as a molecular trigger to switch the polymerization mechanism of a cobalt Salen complex from ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides to organometallic mediated controlled radical polymerization (OMRP) of acrylates. Regulated by both CO and visible light, on&#8208;demand sequence control can be achieved for the synthesis of polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polyacrylate diblock copolymers.







Abstract
A strategy that uses carbon monoxide (CO) as a molecular trigger to switch the polymerization mechanism of a cobalt Salen complex [salen=(R,R)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine] from ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides to organometallic mediated controlled radical polymerization (OMRP) of acrylates is described. The key phenomenon is a rapid and quantitative insertion of CO into the Co&#8722;O bond, allowing for in situ transformation of the ROCOP active species (Salen)CoIII&#8208;OR into the OMRP photoinitiator (Salen)CoIII&#8208;CO2R. The proposed mechanism, which involves CO coordination to (Salen)CoIII&#8208;OR and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement via migratory insertion has been rationalized by DFT calculations. Regulated by both CO and visible light, on&#8208;demand sequence control can be achieved for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polyacrylate diblock copolymers (&#272;&lt;1.15).

      <title>Stable Pyrrole&#8208;Linked Bioconjugates through Tetrazine&#8208;Triggered Azanorbornadiene Fragmentation</title>
      <dc:description>
Click to stabilize: An azanorbornadiene bromovinyl sulfone reagent allows site&#8208;selective protein modification and, in combination with a tetrazine partner, enables the preparation of stable pyrrole&#8208;linked protein conjugates through a new bond&#8208;cleavage reaction. The latter proceeds through a three&#8208;step cascade reaction involving an inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) cycloaddition between tetrazine and the azanorbornadiene&#8208;tagged protein, and two subsequent retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (rDA) reactions.







Abstract
An azanorbornadiene bromovinyl sulfone reagent for cysteine&#8208;selective bioconjugation has been developed. Subsequent reaction with dipyridyl tetrazine leads to bond cleavage and formation of a pyrrole&#8208;linked conjugate. The latter involves ligation of the tetrazine to the azanorbornadiene&#8208;tagged protein through inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition with subsequent double retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to form a stable pyrrole linkage. The sequence of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation followed by bioorthogonal bond cleavage was efficiently employed for the labelling of three different proteins. This method benefits from easy preparation of these reagents, selectivity for cysteine, and stability after reaction with a commercial tetrazine, which has potential for the routine preparation of protein conjugates for chemical biology studies.

      <title>Weakly Coordinated Cobaltacycles: Trapping Catalytically Competent Intermediates in Cp*CoIII Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Chasing unicorns: A versatile platform was developed for capturing thermodynamically unfavored cobaltacyclic species containing weakly chelating moieties (see picture). The strategy offers the opportunity to not only fully characterize direct analogues of key transient reactive species but also interrogate their reactivity and intermediacy in different Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the synthesis of metallacyclic Cp*CoIII complexes containing weakly chelating functional groups. We have employed these compounds not only as an exceptional platform for accessing some of the most widely invoked transient intermediates in C&#8722;H functionalization processes but also as competent catalysts in different Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed transformations, including a benchmark coupling reaction.

      <title>Nanostructure Engineering by Simple Tuning of Lipid Combinations</title>
      <dc:description>
The simple combination of DMPC and DHPC resulted in various lipid nanostructures with distinct structure&#8211;function relationships, differing in uptake, drug encapsulation efficacy, and in&#8197;vivo anti&#8208;tumor therapy.







Abstract
Structural morphology is the key parameter for efficacy of nanomedicine. To date, lipid&#8208;based nanomaterial has been the most widely used material in nanomedicine and many other biomedical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been an in&#8208;depth or systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;function relationship of lipid&#8208;based nanostructures. In this report, we investigated the formulation of novel lipid&#8208;based nanostructures via simple tuning of lipid combinations. To prove this concept, we used a combination of various ratios of simple and common phospholipids with different chain lengths (14&#8208;carbon chain DMPC: 6&#8208;carbon chain DHPC) to find out whether a myriad of novel lipid nanostructures could be obtained. Interestingly, many combinations resulted in distinct lipid nanostructures. Drug encapsulation tests confirmed that they are able to load large amounts of drugs for biological application. In vivo anti&#8208;tumor efficacy revealed that certain lipid nanostructures possessed superior tumor retardation effects.

      <title>Homonuclear Decoupling in 1H&#8197;NMR of Solids by Remote Correlation</title>
      <dc:description>
Narrow it down: A new approach to line narrowing in solid&#8208;state 1H&#8197;NMR spectra is introduced. It is based on remote correlations in anti&#8208;z&#8208;COSY experiments and allows an improvement in resolution of up to a factor of two compared to conventional spectra.







Abstract
The typical linewidths of 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of powdered organic solids at 111&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) are of the order of a few hundred Hz. While this is remarkable in comparison to the tens of kHz observed in spectra of static samples, it is still the key limit to the use of 1H in solid&#8208;state NMR, especially for complex systems. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to further improve the spectral resolution. We show that the anti&#8208;z&#8208;COSY experiment can be used to reduce the residual line broadening of 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of powdered organic solids. Results obtained with the anti&#8208;z&#8208;COSY sequence at 100&#8197;kHz MAS on thymol, &#946;&#8208;AspAla, and strychnine show an improvement in resolution of up to a factor of two compared to conventional spectra acquired at the same spinning rate.

      <title>The Dynamic Nature of CO Adlayers on Pt(111) Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Adsorbed CO on Pt(111) electrodes can become highly mobile at the onset of pre&#8208;oxidation, despite a high adsorbate surface density. Origin of this behavior is the formation of defects in the adlayer, which enable density fluctuations and by this rapid quasi&#8208;collective CO transport.







Abstract
CO adlayers on Pt(111) electrode surfaces are an important electrochemical system and of great relevance to electrocatalysis. The potential&#8208;dependent structure and dynamics of these adlayers are complex and still controversial, especially in the CO pre&#8208;oxidation regime. We here employ in situ high&#8208;speed scanning tunneling microscopy for studying the surface phase behavior in CO&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8201;m H2SO4 on the millisecond time scale. At potentials near the onset of CO pre&#8208;oxidation local fluctuations in the (2&#215;2)&#8208;CO adlayer are observed, which increase towards more positive potentials. Above 0.20&#8197;V (vs. Ag/AgCl), this leads to an adlayer where COad apparently reside on every top site, but still exhibit a (2&#215;2) superstructure modulation. We interpret this observation as a dynamic effect, caused by a small number of highly mobile point defects in the (2&#215;2)&#8208;CO adlayer. As shown by density functional theory calculations, the CO lattice near such defects relaxes into a local (1&#215;1) arrangement, which can rapidly propagate across the surface. This scenario, where a static (2&#215;2) COad sublattice coexists with a highly dynamic sublattice of partially occupied top sites, explains the pronounced COad surface mobility during electrooxidation.

     alt="The Dynamic Nature of CO Adlayers on Pt(111) Electrodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adsorbed CO&lt;/b&gt; on Pt(111) electrodes can become highly mobile at the onset of pre&#8208;oxidation, despite a high adsorbate surface density. Origin of this behavior is the formation of defects in the adlayer, which enable density fluctuations and by this rapid quasi&#8208;collective CO transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO adlayers on Pt(111) electrode surfaces are an important electrochemical system and of great relevance to electrocatalysis. The potential&#8208;dependent structure and dynamics of these adlayers are complex and still controversial, especially in the CO pre&#8208;oxidation regime. We here employ in situ high&#8208;speed scanning tunneling microscopy for studying the surface phase behavior in CO&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8201;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on the millisecond time scale. At potentials near the onset of CO pre&#8208;oxidation local fluctuations in the (2&#215;2)&#8208;CO adlayer are observed, which increase towards more positive potentials. Above 0.20&#8197;V (vs. Ag/AgCl), this leads to an adlayer where CO&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; apparently reside on every top site, but still exhibit a (2&#215;2) superstructure modulation. We interpret this observation as a dynamic effect, caused by a small number of highly mobile point defects in the (2&#215;2)&#8208;CO adlayer.

This scenario, where a static (2&#215;2) CO&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; sublattice coexists with a highly dynamic sublattice of partially occupied top sites, explains the pronounced CO&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; surface mobility during electrooxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Direct Observation of Dynamic Bond Evolution in Single&#8208;Atom Pt/C3N4 Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Caught in the act: Synchronous illumination X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to observe the dynamic charge transfer and bond evolution of a single&#8208;atom Pt/C3N4 catalyst during photocatalytic water splitting (see picture; TEOA=triethanolamine). The mechanism elucidated in this way explains the significantly enhanced H2 production activity of the single&#8208;atom Pt/C3N4 catalyst as compared to C3N4 loaded with Pt particles.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising platforms for heterogeneous catalysis, especially for clean energy conversion, storage, and utilization. Although great efforts have been made to examine the bonding and oxidation state of single&#8208;atom catalysts before and/or after catalytic reactions, when information about dynamic evolution is not sufficient, the underlying mechanisms are often overlooked. Herein, we report the direct observation of the charge transfer and bond evolution of a single&#8208;atom Pt/C3N4 catalyst in photocatalytic water splitting by synchronous illumination X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Specifically, under light excitation, we observed Pt&#8722;N bond cleavage to form a Pt0 species and the corresponding C=N bond reconstruction; these features could not be detected on the metallic platinum&#8208;decorated C3N4 catalyst. As expected, H2 production activity (14.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) was enhanced significantly with the single&#8208;atom Pt/C3N4 catalyst as compared to metallic Pt&#8208;C3N4 (0.74&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1).

      <dc:description>
Highly selective fluorescent ligands derived from the opium poppy were developed by D. Calebiro, M.

      <title>A Dual Threat: Redox&#8208;Activity and Electronic Structures of Well&#8208;Defined Donor&#8211;Acceptor Fulleretic Covalent&#8208;Organic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
A journey into the deep confines of the forest can sometimes lead to new discoveries. Electron acceptors prepared themselves for travel into the unknown of the COF electron&#8208;donating &#8220;forest&#8221;. Instead of getting lost in the deep, dark forest, the acceptor&#8208;based (purely organic) covalently bound, crystalline, and porous scaffolds exhibited not only increases in conductivity, but also retention of the redox&#8208;active nature.







Abstract
The effect of donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) alignment on the materials electronic structure was probed for the first time using novel purely organic porous crystalline materials with covalently bound two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional acceptors. The first studies towards estimation of charge transfer rates as a function of acceptor stacking are in line with the experimentally observed drastic, eight&#8208;fold conductivity enhancement. The first evaluation of redox behavior of buckyball&#8208; or tetracyanoquinodimethane&#8208;integrated crystalline was conducted. In parallel with tailoring the D&#8208;A alignment responsible for &#8220;static&#8221; changes in materials properties, an external stimulus was applied for &#8220;dynamic&#8221; control of the electronic profiles. Overall, the presented D&#8211;A strategic design, with stimuli&#8208;controlled electronic behavior, redox activity, and modularity could be used as a blueprint for the development of electroactive and conductive multidimensional and multifunctional crystalline porous materials.

     alt="A Dual Threat: Redox&#8208;Activity and Electronic Structures of Well&#8208;Defined Donor&#8211;Acceptor Fulleretic Covalent&#8208;Organic Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A journey into the deep confines&lt;/b&gt; of the forest can sometimes lead to new discoveries. Electron acceptors prepared themselves for travel into the unknown of the COF electron&#8208;donating &#8220;forest&#8221;. Instead of getting lost in the deep, dark forest, the acceptor&#8208;based (purely organic) covalently bound, crystalline, and porous scaffolds exhibited not only increases in conductivity, but also retention of the redox&#8208;active nature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) alignment on the materials electronic structure was probed for the first time using novel purely organic porous crystalline materials with covalently bound two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional acceptors. The first studies towards estimation of charge transfer rates as a function of acceptor stacking are in line with the experimentally observed drastic, eight&#8208;fold conductivity enhancement. The first evaluation of redox behavior of buckyball&#8208; or tetracyanoquinodimethane&#8208;integrated crystalline was conducted. In parallel with tailoring the D&#8208;A alignment responsible for &#8220;static&#8221; changes in materials properties, an external stimulus was applied for &#8220;dynamic&#8221; control of the electronic profiles. Overall, the presented D&#8211;A strategic design, with stimuli&#8208;controlled electronic behavior, redox activity, and modularity could be used as a blueprint for the development of electroactive and conductive multidimensional and multifunctional crystalline porous materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strong&#8208;Base&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of a Crystalline Covalent Triazine Framework with High Hydrophilicity via Benzylamine Monomer for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
All about the base: A benzylamine&#8208;functionalized monomer is used to synthesize crystalline and hydrophilic CTF&#8208;HUST&#8208;A1. The base reagent used in the reaction plays an important role in the enhancement of the crystallinity and hydrophilicity. The resulting CTF&#8208;HUST&#8208;A1 shows excellent activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are limited and little attention has been paid to development of hydrophilic CTFs and photocatalytic overall water splitting. A route to synthesize crystalline and hydrophilic CTF&#8208;HUST&#8208;A1 with a benzylamine&#8208;functionalized monomer is presented. The base reagent used plays an important role in the enhancement of crystallinity and hydrophilicity. CTF&#8208;HUST&#8208;A1 exhibits good crystallinity, excellent hydrophilicity, and excellent photocatalytic activity in sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (hydrogen evolution rate up to 9200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Photocatalytic overall water splitting is achieved by depositing dual co&#8208;catalysts in CTF&#8208;HUST&#8208;A1, with H2 evolution and O2 evolution rates of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 12.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water without using sacrificial agent.

      <title>An &#951;3&#8208;Bound Allyl Ligand on Magnesium in a Mechanochemically Generated Mg/K Allyl Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Pi at last! Milling K[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3] (=K[A&#8242;]) with MgX2 (X=Cl, Br) produces the orange heterometallic allyl complex [K2MgA&#8242;4]. The crystal structure contains the first terminal &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligand on a Mg center. Methyl methacrylate is polymerized by this complex, with activities that are comparable to K[A&#8242;] and greater than that of [{MgA&#8242;2}2].







Abstract
Milling two equivalents of K[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3] (=K[A&#8242;]) with MgX2 (X=Cl, Br) produces the allyl complex [K2MgA&#8242;4] (1). Crystals grown from toluene are of the solvated species [((&#951;6&#8208;tol)K)2MgA&#8242;4] ([1&#8901;2(tol)]), a trimetallic monomer with both bridging and terminal (&#951;1) allyl ligands. When recrystallized from hexanes, the unsolvated 1 forms a 2D coordination polymer, in which the Mg is surrounded by three allyl ligands. The C&#8722;C bond lengths differ by only 0.028&#8197;&#197;, indicating virtually complete electron delocalization. This is an unprecedented coordination mode for an allyl ligand bound to Mg. DFT calculations indicate that in isolation, an &#951;3&#8208;allyl configuration on Mg is energetically preferred over the &#951;1&#8208; (&#963;&#8208;bonded) arrangement, but the Mg must be in a low coordination environment for it to be experimentally realized. Methyl methacrylate is effectively polymerized by 1, with activities that are comparable to K[A&#8242;] and greater than the homometallic magnesium complex [{MgA&#8242;2}2].

      <title>Tunable DNA Origami Motors Translocate Ballistically Over &#956;m Distances at nm/s Speeds</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanomotors: The first example of a DNA origami nanomotor that processively converts chemical fuel into sustained mechanical motion is presented. Tunable DNA origami motors travel linearly for micron distances at nm/s speeds.







Abstract
Inspired by biological motor proteins, that efficiently convert chemical fuel to unidirectional motion, there has been considerable interest in developing synthetic analogues. Among the synthetic motors created thus far, DNA motors that undertake discrete steps on RNA tracks have shown the greatest promise. Nonetheless, DNA nanomotors lack intrinsic directionality, are low speed and take a limited number of steps prior to stalling or dissociation. Herein, we report the first example of a highly tunable DNA origami motor that moves linearly over micron distances at an average speed of 40&#8197;nm/min. Importantly, nanomotors move unidirectionally without intervention through an external force field or a patterned track. Because DNA origami enables precise testing of nanoscale structure&#8208;function relationships, we were able to experimentally study the role of motor shape, chassis flexibility, leg distribution, and total number of legs in tuning performance. An anisotropic rigid chassis coupled with a high density of legs maximizes nanomotor speed and endurance.

      <dc:description>Guiding the lithium&#8208;ion (Li&#8208;ion) transport for homogeneous, dispersive distribution is crucial for dendrite&#8208;free Li anodes with high current density and long&#8208;term cyclability, but remains challenging for the unavailable well&#8208;designed nanostructures.

Owing to the synergy from Li&#8208;ion transport nanochannels of mPPy and Li&#8208;ion nanosieves of defective GO, 2D mPPy&#8208;GO heterostructure achieves ultralong cycling stability (1000 cycles), even test at 0 and 50  o  C, ultralow overpotential of 70 mV at high current density of 10.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  , outperforming most of reported Li anodes. Furthermore, mPPy&#8208;GO&#8208;Li/LiCoO  2  full batteries demonstrate remarkably enhanced performance with capacity retention of &gt; 90% after 450 cycles.

      <title>NaGaS2 &#8211; an Elusive Layered Compound with Dynamic Water Absorption and Wide&#8208;Ranging Ion Exchange Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Most ternary sulfides belonging to the  M  GaS  2  structure&#8208;type have been known for many years and are well&#8208;characterized.

      <title>Discovery of chemicals to clear or indicate amyloid aggregates by targeting memory&#8208;impairing anti&#8208;parallel A&#946; dimers</title>
      <dc:description>Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) oligomers are implicated in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, their unstable nature and heterogeneous state disrupts elucidation of their explicit role in AD progression, impeding the development of tools targeting soluble A&#946; oligomers. To address such obstacles, we designed and synthesized parallel and anti&#8208;parallel variants of A&#946;(1&#8208;40) dimers and characterized their pathogenic properties in AD models. We found anti&#8208;parallel dimers induced cognitive impairments with increased amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity, and subsequently developed a screening platform by immobilizing this dimer variant on 96&#8208;well&#8208;plates. Through screening, we identified two FDA&#8208;approved drugs, Oxytetracycline and Sunitinib, which were able to dissociate A&#946; oligomers and plaques to monomers in 5XFAD transgenic mice. In addition, we discovered a fluorescent chemical, Astrophloxine, that could detect aggregated A&#946; in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid samples of AD mice. Our screening platform provides a stable and homogeneous environment permitting isolated observations of A&#946; interactions with dimer&#8208;specific molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Dysprosiacarboranes as Organometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets
</title>
      <dc:description>
Dysprosiacarborane complexes based on the interaction between &#951;5&#8208;dicarbollide ligands [C2B9H112&#8722; and (o&#8208;xylylene&#8208;C2B9H9)2&#8722;] and the dysprosium(III) cation show large effective energy barriers for slow magnetic relaxation and a magnet&#8208;type hysteresis loop up to 6.8&#8197;K, which may provide a new type of organometallic ligand for the design of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnets.







Abstract
The dicarbollide ion, nido&#8208;C2B9H112&#8722; is isoelectronic with cyclopentadienyl. Herein, we make dysprosiacarboranes, namely [(C2B9H11)2Ln(THF)2][Na(THF)5] (Ln=Dy, 1Dy) and [(THF)3(&#956;&#8208;H)3Li]2[{&#951;5&#8208;C6H4(CH2)2C2B9H9}Dy{&#951;2:&#951;5&#8208;C6H4(CH2)2C2B9H9}2Li] 3Dy and show that dicarbollide ligands impose strong magnetic axiality on the central DyIII ion. The effective energy barrier (Ueff) for the loss of magnetization can be varied by the substitution pattern on the dicarbollide. This finding is demonstrated by comparing complexes of nido&#8208;C2B9H112&#8722; and nido&#8208;[o&#8208;xylylene&#8208;C2B9H9]2&#8722;, which show a Ueff of 430(5)&#8197;K and 804(7)&#8197;K, respectively. The blocking temperature defined by the open hysteresis temperature of 3Dy reaches 6.8&#8197;K. Moreover, the linear complex [Dy(C2B9H11)2]&#8722; is predicted to have comparable properties with the linear [Dy(CpMe3)2]+ complex. As such, carboranyl ligands and their derivatives may provide a new type of organometallic ligand for high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnets.

      <title>Gadolinium Photocatalysis: Dearomative [2+2] Cycloaddition/Ring&#8208;Expansion Sequence with Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>
Gadolinium photocatalysis: A highly regioselective, intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition/ring&#8208;expansion sequence with indoles is introduced, which could provide divergent access to cyclopenta[b]indoles and indolines. A simple and commercially available Gd(OTf)3 salt is sufficient for this visible&#8208;violet&#8208;light&#8208;induced transformation.







Abstract
Lanthanide photocatalysts are much less investigated in synthetic chemistry than rare and expensive late transition metals. We herein introduce GdIII photocatalysis of a highly regioselective, intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition/ring&#8208;expansion sequence with indoles, which could provide divergent access to cyclopenta[b]indoles and indolines. A simple and commercially available Gd(OTf)3 salt is sufficient for this visible&#8208;violet&#8208;light&#8208;induced transformation. The reaction proceeds either through a transient or start&#8208;to&#8208;end dearomatization cascade and shows excellent regioselectivity (usually &gt;95:5 r.r.), broad scope (59 examples), good functional group tolerance and facile scale&#8208;up under mild, direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal that direct excitation of the Gd(OTf)3/indole mixture gives an excited state intermediate, which undergoes the subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition and cyclobutane&#8208;expansion cascade.

      <title>Manipulating Layered P2@P3 Integrated Spinel Structure Evolution for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal structure engineering and element substitution has led to the stable layered P2@P3 integrated spinel cathode material Na0.5Ni0.1Co0.15Mn0.65Mg0.1O2. The magnesium manipulates its structural evolution to afford reasonable phase ratios and suppresses unfavorable phase transformation as well as relieving the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, which results in the material showing an excellent performance in a sodium&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
Structural evolution of the cathode during cycling plays a vital role in the electrochemical performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. A strategy based on engineering the crystal structure coupled with chemical substitution led to the design of the layered P2@P3 integrated spinel oxide cathode Na0.5Ni0.1Co0.15Mn0.65Mg0.1O2, which shows excellent sodium&#8208;ion half/full battery performance. Combined analyses involving scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution as well as in&#8197;situ synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and in&#8197;situ synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns led to visualization of the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in this structure and opens up a novel field based on manipulating structural evolution for the design of high&#8208;performance battery cathodes.

      <title>A Spiderweb&#8208;Like Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Multifunctional Foam</title>
      <dc:description>
Spidey sense: A general strategy for precise control over the properties of both the hierarchical support and MOFs is presented. It enables the good dispersion of individual MOF nanoparticles on a spiderweb&#8208;like network within each macrovoid even at high loadings.







Abstract
Processing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into hierarchical macroscopic materials can greatly extend their practical applications. However, current strategies suffer from severe aggregation of MOFs and limited tuning of the hierarchical porous network. Now, a strategy is presented that can simultaneously tune the MOF loading, composition, spatial distribution, and confinement within various bio&#8208;originated macroscopic supports, as well as control the accessibility, robustness, and formability of the support itself. This method enables the good dispersion of individual MOF nanoparticles on a spiderweb&#8208;like network within each macrovoid even at high loadings (up to 86&#8197;wt&#8201;%), ensuring the foam pores are highly accessible for excellent adsorption and catalytic capacity. Additionally, this approach allows the direct pre&#8208;incorporation of other functional components into the framework. This strategy provides precise control over the properties of both the hierarchical support and MOF.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Free Energy of Local Biological Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Set me free: A new experimental approach for estimating the H&#8208;bond free energy of local biological water has been proposed. This was made possible by combining time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and installation of a fluorescent, prototropic hydration probe at protein surfaces. This study promises access to energetics and dynamics of local biological water at protein surfaces of interest.







Abstract
Here, we propose an experimental methodology based on femtosecond&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond free energy of water at protein surfaces under isothermal conditions. A demonstration was conducted by installing a non&#8208;canonical isostere of tryptophan (7&#8208;azatryptophan) at the surface of a coiled&#8208;coil protein to exploit the photoinduced proton transfer of its chromophoric moiety, 7&#8208;azaindole. The H&#8208;bond free energy of this biological water was evaluated by comparing the rates of proton transfer, sensitive to the hydration environment, at the protein surface and in bulk water, and it was found to be higher than that of bulk water by 0.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The free&#8208;energy difference is dominated by the entropic cost in the H&#8208;bond network among water molecules at the hydrophilic and charged protein surface. Our study opens a door to accessing the energetics and dynamics of local biological water to give insight into its roles in protein structure and function.
