      <title>Controlling Metallophilic Interactions in Chiral Au(I) Double Salts towards Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (Ex&#8208;De PL) in the visible region have potential applications in bioimaging, optoelectronics and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, we report two multifunctional, chiral [Au(NHC)  2  ][Au(CN)  2  ] (NHC = (4R,5R)/(4S,5S)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) complex double salts that display Ex&#8208;De circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in doped polymer films and in ground powder state. Their emission maxima can be dynamically tuned from 440 to 530 nm by changing the excitation wavelength. Through both experimental and theoretical studies, we propose that the continuously tunable photoluminescence originates from multiple emissive excited states as a result of the existence of varied Au(I)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(I) distances in ground state. The steric properties of the NHC ligand are crucial to the tuning of Au(I)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(I) distances. We also demonstrate an anti&#8208;counterfeiting application using these two salts. This unique Ex&#8208;De CPL mechanism of the metal complex double salts opens a new avenue for the development of smart photoluminescence materials by manipulating noncovalent metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives have been widely explored for various applications owing to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties. However, inherent shortcomings, such as the instability and self&#8208;quenching in physiological conditions, limit their biomedical applications.

This review article summarizes important synthesis strategies for porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs including porphyrin@MOFs, porphyrinic MOFs and composite porphyrinic MOFs, and highlights recent achievements and progress in the field of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs for biomedical applications in tumor therapy and biosensing.

      <title>Dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes enabled by sodium benzenedithiolate&#8208;rich protection layer</title>
      <dc:description>Sodium metal is an ideal anode material for metal rechargeable batteries, owing to its high theoretical capacity (1166 mAh g&#8208;1), low cost, and earth&#8208;abundance. However, the dendritic growth upon Na plating, stemming from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, is a major and most notable problem. Here, we report that a sodium benzenedithiolate (PhS2Na2)&#8208;rich protection layer synthesized in situ on sodium by a facile methodology effectively prevents dendrite growth in the carbonate electrolyte, leading to a stabilized sodium metal electrodeposition for 400 cycles (800 h) of repeated plating/stripping at a current density of 1mA cm&#8208;2. The organic salt, PhS2Na2, is found to be a critical component in the protection layer, and is different from traditional inorganic salts. This &#64257;nding opens up a new and promising avenue, based on organic sodium slats, to stabilize sodium metals with protection layer.</dc:description>

      <title>Semiconductor&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Z&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we developed a versatile strategy to covalently connect crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with semiconductors to create stable organic&#8208;inorganic Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for artificial photosynthesis. A series of COF&#8208;semiconductor Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts integrating water oxidation semiconductors (TiO2, Bi2WO6 and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) with CO2 reduction COFs (COF&#8208;316/318) were synthesized and exhibited high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency (69.67/ 57.1/ 31.43 &#956;mol/g/h for COF&#8208;318&#8208;TiO2/&#8208;Bi2WO6/&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3), with H2O as electron donor in the gas&#8208;solid CO2 reduction without additional photosensitizers and sacrificial agents. This is the first report of covalent bonded COF&#8208;inorganic semiconductor Z&#8208;scheme applied for artificial photosynthesis. Experiments and density functional theory confirmed the efficient electron transfer from semiconductors to COFs by covalent coupling, resulting in the electrons accumulated in cyano/pyridine of COF for CO2 reduction and positive holes leave in semiconductor for H2O oxidation, thus mimicking the natural photosynthesis.

      <title>Early Transition Metal Catalysis for Olefin&#8208;Polar Monomer Copolymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Introducing polar functional groups into widely used polyolefins can enhance polymer surface, rheological, mixing, and other properties, potentiallly upgrading polyolefins for advanced, value&#8208;added applications. The metal catalyst&#8208;mediated copolymer&#8208;ization of non&#8208;polar olefins with polar comonomers represents the seemingly most straightforward, atom&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient approach for synthesizing polar functionalized polyolefins. However, electrophilic early transition metal (groups 3 and 4)&#8208;catalyzed processes which have achieved remarkable success in conventional olefin polymerizations, encounter severe limitations here, associated with the Lewis basicity of the &#160;polar co&#8208;monomers. In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechnistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.</dc:description>

In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechnistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Untargeted Tumor Metabolomics with Liquid Chromatography&#8211;Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A better look: Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is demonstrated for untargeted tumor metabolomics. Metabolic fingerprinting with SERS is a promising approach to capturing biological and metabolic information without the requirement of absolute metabolite identification, which can leverage the use of previously discarded data of unidentified metabolites for tumor metabolomics.







Abstract
Metabolomics is a powerful systems biology approach that monitors changes in biomolecule concentrations to diagnose and monitor health and disease. However, leading metabolomics technologies, such as NMR and mass spectrometry (MS), access only a small portion of the metabolome. Now an approach is presented that uses the high sensitivity and chemical specificity of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for online detection of metabolites from tumor lysates following liquid chromatography (LC). The results demonstrate that this LC&#8208;SERS approach has metabolite detection capabilities comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art LC&#8208;MS but suggest a selectivity for the detection of a different subset of metabolites. Analysis of replicate LC&#8208;SERS experiments exhibit reproducible metabolite patterns that can be converted into barcodes, which can differentiate different tumor models. Our work demonstrates the potential of LC&#8208;SERS technology for metabolomics&#8208;based diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

      <title>In&#8208;Depth TEM Investigation on Structural Inhomogeneity within a Primary LixNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 Particle: Origin of Capacity Decay during High&#8208;Rate Discharge</title>
      <dc:description>
Origin of capacity decay: Structural evolutions within a primary LiNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 (NCA83) particle, as a cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries, were investigated during various electrochemical processes using TEM. Significant reduction in the electrochemical capacity of NCA83 in the second charge is correlated with the development of nano&#8208;scale and micro&#8208;scale structural inversions.







Abstract
The structural stability of cathode materials during electrochemical reactions, in particular, under high&#8208;rate discharge, is pertinent to the design and development of new electrode materials. This study investigates the structural inhomogeneity that develops within a single LiNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 (NCA83) particle during a fast discharging process under different cutoff voltages. Some of the NCA83 particles discharged from a high cutoff voltage (4.8&#8197;V) developed surface areas in which the layered structure was recovered, although the interiors retained the degraded spinel structure. These micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale structural inversions from high cutoff voltage seem highly correlated with structural evolutions in the initial charged state, and may ultimately degrade the cycling stability. This study advances understanding of the structural inhomogeneity within primary particles during various electrochemical processes and may facilitate the development of new Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

      <title>In&#8197;Vivo Solid&#8208;Phase Microextraction for Sampling of Oxylipins in Brain of Awake, Moving Rats</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible in&#8197;vivo solid&#8208;phase microextraction was used to measure 52 eicosanoids and other oxylipins directly in brains of awake moving rats with high temporal and spatial resolution. In&#8197;vivo profiles of extracellular brain fluid did not reflect oxylipin concentrations in post&#8208;mortem tissue and provide a novel tool to elucidate oxylipin pathways and function.







Abstract
Oxylipins are key lipid mediators of important brain processes, including pain, sleep, oxidative stress, and inflammation. For the first time, an in&#8208;depth profile of up to 52 oxylipins can be obtained from the brains of awake moving animals using in&#8197;vivo solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) chemical biopsy tool in combination with liquid chromatography&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry. Among these, 23 oxylipins are detectable in the majority of healthy wildtype samples. This new approach successfully eliminates the changes in oxylipin concentrations routinely observed during the analysis of post&#8208;mortem samples, allows time&#8208;course monitoring of their concentrations with high spatial resolution in specific brain regions of interest, and can be performed using the same experimental set&#8208;up as in&#8197;vivo microdialysis (MD) thus providing a new and exciting tool in neuroscience and drug discovery.

      <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics strategy is used to implant a &#8220;GPS device&#8221; on bacteria to track their location and interacting proteins. This strategy, reported by W.&#8197;A. Tao, Y. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;2235, involves labeling the living bacteria with a photoreactive linker and a biotin group for the isolation and analysis of crosslinked proteins by mass spectrometry at designated time points during the bacterial infection.

      <title>The Chemistry, Biology, and Modulation of Ammonium Nitrification in Soil</title>
      <dc:description>
The low efficiency of ammonium fertilizers used in agriculture contributes to significant environmental issues and economic losses. This Review discusses the chemistry and enzymatic mechanisms of microbial nitrification in the soil and highlights phytochemicals which can act as nitrification inhibitors, thus providing opportunities to stabilize ammonium in farm soils to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use.







Abstract
Approximately two percent of the world's energy is consumed in the production of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gas. Ammonia is used as a fertilizer ingredient for agriculture and distributed in the environment on an enormous scale to promote crop growth in intensive farming. Only 30&#8211;50&#8201;% of the nitrogen applied is assimilated by crop plants; the remaining 50&#8211;70&#8201;% goes into biological processes such as nitrification by microbial metabolism in the soil. This leads to an imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle and higher nitrous oxide emissions (a potent and significant greenhouse gas) as well as contamination of ground and surface waters by nitrate from the nitrogen&#8208;fertilized farmland. This Review gives a critical overview of the current knowledge of soil microbes involved in the chemistry of ammonia nitrification, the structures and mechanisms of the enzymes involved, and phytochemicals capable of inhibiting ammonia nitrification.

Abstract
[2.2]Paracyclophane (PCP) is a prevalent scaffold that is widely utilized in asymmetric synthesis, &#960;&#8208;stacked polymers, energy materials, and functional parylene coatings that finds broad applications in bio&#8208; and materials science. In the last few years, [2.2]paracyclophane chemistry has progressed tremendously, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of its structural and functional properties. This Minireview highlights the most important recent synthetic developments in the selective functionalization of PCP that govern distinct features of planar chirality as well as chiroptical and optoelectronic properties. Special focus is given to the function&#8208;inspired design of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;stacked conjugated materials by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Current synthetic challenges, limitations, as well as future research directions and new avenues for advancing cyclophane chemistry are also summarized.

This Minireview highlights the most important recent synthetic developments in the selective functionalization of PCP that govern distinct features of planar chirality as well as chiroptical and optoelectronic properties. Special focus is given to the function&#8208;inspired design of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;stacked conjugated materials by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Current synthetic challenges, limitations, as well as future research directions and new avenues for advancing cyclophane chemistry are also summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reshaping of Metal Nanoparticles Under Reaction Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting into shape: This Minireview gives a summary of the latest progress in characterizing and modeling the equilibrium shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in reactive environments through the combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) experiments and the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model.







Abstract
The shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is one of the key factors determining their catalytic reactivity. Recent in&#8197;situ TEM observations show that dynamic reshaping of metal NPs occurs under the reaction conditions, which becomes a major hurdle for fully understanding catalytic mechanisms at the molecular level. This Minireview provides a summary of the latest progress in characterizing and modeling the equilibrium shape of metal NPs in various reactive environments through the joint effort of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy experiments and a newly developed multiscale structure reconstruction model. The quantitative agreement between the experimental observations and theoretical modeling demonstrate that the fundamental mechanism of the reshaping phenomenon is driven by anisotropically changed surface energies under gas adsorption. The predictable reshaping of metal NPs paves the way for the rational design of truly efficient nanocatalysts in real reactions.

      <dc:description>
Hype in science is commonplace, compounded by the hypocrisy of those who engage in or tolerate it while disapproving of the consequences. These are first steps along a slippery slope of hype, hypocrisy, data falsification, and dissemination of fake science, encouraged by systemic drivers in the contemporary structure of the science establishment.

Abstract
In chemistry and other sciences, hype has become commonplace, compounded by the hypocrisy of those who tolerate or encourage it while disapproving of the consequences. This reduces the credibility and trust upon which all science depends for support. Hype and hypocrisy are but first steps down a slippery slope towards falsification of results and dissemination of fake science. Systemic drivers in the contemporary structure of the science establishment encourage exaggeration and may lure the individual into further steps along the hype&#8208;hypocrisy&#8208;falsification&#8208;fakery continuum. Collective, concerted intervention is required to effectively discourage entry to this dangerous pathway and to restore and protect the probity and reputation of the science system. Chemists must play and active role in this effort.

      <title>Imparting Multifunctionality by Utilizing Biporosity in a Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
The biporous nature of UiO&#8208;66 is utilized to incorporate conducting polymer moieties into the voids of the metal&#8211;organic framework. In this way the resulting nanocomposites display significant porosity and simultaneous million&#8208;fold enhancement in electrical conductivity along with ultralow thermal conductivity.







Abstract
In this work, we have synthesized nanocomposites made up of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and conducting polymers by polymerization of specialty monomers such as pyrrole (Py) and 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the voids of a stable and biporous Zr&#8208;based MOF (UiO&#8208;66). FTIR and Raman data confirmed the presence of polypyrrole (PPy) and poly3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PPy and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PEDOT nanocomposites, respectively, and PXRD data revealed successful retention of the structure of the MOF. HRTEM images showed successful incorporation of polymer fibers inside the voids of the framework. Owing to the intrinsic biporosity of UiO&#8208;66, polymer chains were observed to selectively occupy only one of the voids. This resulted in a remarkable enhancement (million&#8208;fold) of the electrical conductivity while the nanocomposites retain 60&#8211;70&#8201;% of the porosity of the original MOF. These semiconducting yet significantly porous MOF nanocomposite systems exhibited ultralow thermal conductivity. Enhanced electrical conductivity with lowered thermal conductivity could qualify such MOF nanocomposites for thermoelectric applications.

      <title>Flexible Total Synthesis of 11&#8208;Deoxylandomycins and Their Non&#8208;Natural Analogues by Way of Asymmetric Metal Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A collective total synthesis of 11&#8208; deoxylandomycins is reported using Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of alkoxyallene as the key strategy. This de novo approach allowed for an access to various natural and non&#8208;natural congeners of 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins.







Abstract
A de novo first collective total synthesis of 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins is reported. A signature step is featured by the Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of alcohol to ene&#8208;alkoxyallenes that assembles oligomeric 2,3,6&#8208;trideoxyoligosaccharides. The unique feature of the protocol is illustrated by a flexible access to various natural 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.

      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven controlled polymerization of acrylate monomers using organic photoredox catalysts is described by G. M. Miyake et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201910828).

      <title>Photoacoustic Imaging Quantifies Drug Release from Nanocarriers via Redox Chemistry of Dye&#8208;Labeled Cargo</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoacoustic imaging enables a new strategy to monitor drug delivery as reported by J.&#8197;V. Jokerst and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914120). Here, the paclitaxel drug is tagged with a redox&#8208;active methylene blue. This drug&#8211;dye conjugate was sealed inside a poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanocarrier in the reduced state where it does not absorb light. When the drug&#8211;dye conjugate is released, the dye is oxidized to report the location and quantity of the cargo.

      <dc:description>As a kind of photoluminescent materials, Cu(I) complexes have many advantages such as adjustable emission, variable structures and low cost, attracting attention in many fields. In this work, two novel two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I)&#8208;NHC complexes were synthesized, exhibiting unique dual&#8208;emissive property from fluorescence and phosphorescence. The crystal structure, stacking mode and photophysical properties under different conditions were systematically studied, proving the emissive mechanism to be the locally excited state of the carbazole group. Based on this emissive mechanism, ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with a lifetime of 140 ms is achieved by selective deuteration of the carbazole group. These results deepen the understanding of the luminescent mechanism and design strategy in two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes, and prove their potential application as ultralong RTP materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Rapid, High&#8208;Contrast Visualization of Folate&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Expressing Tumors in Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Folate receptors (FRs) are membrane proteins involved in folic acid uptake, and the alpha isoform (FR&#8208;a) is overexpressed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. For fluorescence imaging of FRs in vivo, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (650&#8211;900 nm), where tissue penetration is high and autofluorescence is low, is optimal, but existing NIR fluorescent probes targeting FR&#8208;a show high non&#8208;specific tissue adsorption, and require prolonged washout to visualize tumors. We have designed and synthesized a new NIR fluorescent probe, FolateSiR&#8208;1, utilizing a Si&#8208;rhodamine fluorophore having a carboxy group at the benzene moiety, coupled to a folate ligand moiety via a negatively charged tripeptide linker. This probe exhibits very low background fluorescence, and afforded a tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) of up to 83 in FR&#8208;expressing tumor&#8208;bearing mice within 30 min. Thus, FolateSiR&#8208;1 has the potential to contribute to the research in the field of biology and the clinical medicine.</dc:description>

      <title>A Molecular Strategy to Lock&#8208;in the Conformation of a Perylene bisimide&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular assemblies provides a new avenue to regulate the (opto)electronic properties of robust nanoscale objects. In the present contribution, we show that the covalent tethering of a perylene bisimide (PBI)&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer with a molecular locker enables the formation of a locked superstructure equipped with emergent structure&#8208;function relationships. Experiments that exploit variable&#8208;temperature ground&#8208;state electronic absorption spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrate that the excitonic coupling between nearest neighboring units in the tethered superstructure is preserved at a temperature (371 K) where the pristine, non&#8208;covalent assembly exists exclusively in a molecularly dissolved state. A close examination of the solid&#8208;state morphologies reveals that the locked superstructure engenders the formation of hierarchical 1D materials which are not achievable by unlocked assemblies. To complement these structural attributes, we further demonstrate that covalently tethering a supramolecular polymer built from PBI subunits enables the emergence of electronic properties not evidenced in non&#8208;covalent assemblies. Using cyclic voltammetry experiments, the elucidation of the potentiometric properties of the locked superstructure reveals a 100&#8208;mV stabilization of the conduction band energy when compared to that recorded for a non&#8208;covalent assembly.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;C Single Bond Cleavage: Making the Cut in Total Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C single bond cleavage can enable entirely new retrosynthetic disconnections in natural product total synthesis. Given that C&#8211;C bond cleavage inherently alters the carbon framework of a compound, and that, under transition metal catalysis, the generated organometallic or radical intermediate is primed for further complexity&#8208;building reactivity, C&#8211;C bond cleavage events have the potential to drastically and rapidly remodel skeletal frameworks. The recent acceleration in the use of transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C single bond cleavage in total synthesis can be ascribed to a communal recognition of this fact. In this Review, we highlight ten selected total syntheses from 2014&#8211;2019 that illustrate how transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C single bond cleavage on either the core or the periphery of synthetic intermediates can streamline synthetic efforts</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low Pressure Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Separations</title>
      <dc:description>The resurgence of interest in the hydrogen economy could hinge on the distribution of hydrogen in a safe and efficient manner. Whilst great progress has been made with cryogenic hydrogen storage or liquefied ammonia, Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) remain attractive due to their lack of need for cryogenic temperatures or high pressures, most commonly a cycle between methylcyclohexane and toluene. Oxidation of methylcyclohexane to release hydrogen will be more efficient if the equilibrium limitations can be removed by separating the mixture. This report describes a family of six ternary and quaternary multicomponent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that contain the three&#8208;dimensional cubane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (cdc) ligand. Of these MOFs, the most promising is a quaternary MOF (CUB&#8208;30), comprising cdc, 4,4'&#8208;biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdc) and tritopic truxene linkers. Contrary to conventional wisdom that adsorptive interactions with larger, hydrocarbon guests are dominated by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, here we report that contoured aliphatic pore environments can exhibit high selectivity and capacity for LOHC separations at low pressures. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, where selective adsorption for cyclohexane over benzene is witnessed, underlining the unique adsorptive behavior afforded by the unconventional cubane moiety.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Diverse Electron&#8208;deficient Corona[5]arenes and Their Selective Complexation with Dihydrogen Phosphate: A Cooperative Effect of Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report in this communication the synthesis, conformational structure, electrochemical property and non&#8208;covalent anion binding of corona[5]arenes. A [3+2] fragment coupling reaction of 1,4&#8208;bis((6&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene and derivatives with HS&#8208;C  6  H  4  &#8208;X&#8208;C  6  H  4  &#8208;SH (X = S, CH  2  , CMe  2  and O) proceeded efficiently under mild conditions to produce a number of novel heteroatom and methylene bridged corona[3]arene[2]tetrazine macrocycles. Further selective oxidation of the sulfur atom between two phenylene rings afforded sulfoxide&#8208; and sulfone&#8208;linked corona[5]arenes in good yields. All corona[5]arenes synthesized adopted similar 1,2,4&#8208;alternate conformational structures forming pentagonal cavities. The cavity sizes and the electronic properties such as redox potentials, which were measured with CV and DPV, were regulated by the combination of bridging units. As electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles, the acquired corona[3]arene[2]tetrazines acted as highly selective hosts to form complexes with the hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer of dihydrogen phosphate through cooperative anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>A Sequential Dual&#8208;Lock Strategy for Photoactivatable Chemiluminescent Probes Enabling Bright Duplex Optical Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;based technologies have revolutionized in&#8208;vivo monitoring of biomolecules. However, significant technical hurdles in probe chemistry have limited the achievement of trigger&#8208;controlled, bright and enriched CL signal. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;lock strategy by sequence&#8208;dependent triggers for bright optical imaging with the integration of real&#8208;time fluorescent signal and ultra&#8208;sensitive CL signal. These probes can obtain an analyte&#8208;triggered accumulation of stable pre&#8208;chemiluminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and then the pre&#8208;chemiluminophore exhibits a rapid photooxidation process (1,2&#8208;dioxetane generation) by TICT&#8208;based free&#8208;radical addition, thereby achieving an enrichment and bright CL signal. The dual&#8208;lock strategy expands the in vivo toolbox for highly accurate analysis, and has for the first time allowed access to accurately sense and trace biomolecules with high&#8208;resolution, dual&#8208;mode of chemo&#8208;fluoro&#8208;luminescence, and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging in living animals.</dc:description>

      <title>Observation of non&#8208;FCC Copper in Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Cu53 Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the great effort, the only feasible access to non face&#8208;centered cubic (  FCC  ) copper is by physical vapor deposition under high vacuum. We report the first observation of non&#8208;  FCC  copper in a series of alkynyl protected Cu  53  nanoclusters (NCs) obtained from solution phase synthesis. Determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the total structures of Cu  53  (C&#8801;CPhPh)  9  (dppp)  6  Cl  3  (NO  3  )  9  and its two derivatives reveal their most prominent feature: an ABABC stacking sequence involving 41 Cu atoms. It can be regarded as a mixed  FCC  and  HCP  structure, which gives strong evidence that Cu can be arranged in non&#8208;  FCC  lattice at ambient condition when proper ligands are provided. To gain a deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of Cu NCs, characterization methods including X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, XPS, ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;vis, Auger spectroscopies and DFT calculations are carried out. It is revealed that Cu  II  successively coordinated with introduced ligands and changed to Cu  I  after bonding with phosphine. The following addition of NaBH  4  and the aging step further reduced it to the title NC. Their applications in homocoupling of phenylacetylene are also studied.</dc:description>

      <title>Environment&#8208;Recognizing DNA Computation Circuit&#8208;Controlled Intracellular Transport of Molecular Payloads for mRNA Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Programming intelligent DNA nanocarriers for targeted transport of molecular payloads (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides) in living cells has attracted extensive attentions. In vivo  activation of these nanocarriers usually relies on external light irradiation. An emerging interest is to enable them to automatically recognize the intracellular surroundings and thereby be activated in situ  under the logic control of programmed DNA computation circuits. Towards this goal, here we integrate DNA computation circuits with framework nucleic acid (FNA) nanocarriers that consist of a truncated square pyramid (TSP) cage and a built&#8208;in duplex cargo containing an antisense strand of the target mRNA. An i&#8208;motif and ATP aptamer embedded in TSP are employed as logic controlling units to respond to endogenous proton and ATP inside subcellular compartments, triggering the release of the sensing element for fluorescent mRNA imaging. Given the abnormal levels of extra&#8208;/intracellular pH and ATP in tumor tissues, our logic&#8208;controlled FNA devices are of benefit to target drug delivery and precise disease treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>High ethylene selectivity in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction over MOR nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Precisely controlled crystal growth endows zeolites with special textural and catalytic properties. A nanosheet mordenite zeolite with a thickness of ~11 nm, named as MOR&#8208;NS, has been prepared using a well&#8208;designed gemini&#8208;type amphiphilic surfactant as bifunctional structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA).

This kind of orientated crystallization took place through the inorganic&#8208;organic interaction between silica species and SDA molecules existing in the whole process. The thin MOR nanosheets, with highly exposed (010) planes and 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) windows therein, exhibited an extremely higher ethylene selectivity (42.1%) for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin reactions when compared with conventional bulk MOR crystals (3.3%). Moreover, MOR&#8208;NS also possessed hierarchical structure and larger external surface area, making it a promising catalyst for processing bulky reactions like the alkylation of anisole with benzyl alcohol.</dc:description>

An unprecedented regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes to homoallylic alcohols is described. The use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3), a commercially available Lewis acid was key to obtain good yields and selectivities since other Lewis acids afforded mixtures of isomers and substantial polymerization.

      <title>Enantiomorphic Microvortex&#8208;Enabled Supramolecular Sensing of Racemic Amino Acids by Using Achiral Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
Spin me round: An enantiomorphic microvortex&#8208;enabled supramolecular sensing system for the quantitative detection of racemic or enantiomeric amino acids was developed. The system has unique advantages including straightforward operation, rapid detection, and no use of chiral additives.







Abstract
Chiral analysis of bioactive molecules is of increasing significance in chemical and life sciences. However, the quantitative detection of a racemic mixture of enantiomers is a challenging task, which relies on complicated and time&#8208;consuming multiple steps of chiral derivatization, chiral separation, and spectroscopic measurement. Herein, we show that, without the use of chiral molecules or pretreatment steps, the co&#8208;assembly of amino acids with achiral TPPS4 monomers controlled by enantiomorphic microvortices allows quantitative detection of racemic or enantiomeric amino acids, through analysis of the sign and magnitude of supramolecular chirality in different outlets of a microfluidic platform. A model demonstrates that chiral microvortices can induce an initial chiral bias by bending the sheet structure, resulting in supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of TPPS4 and amino acids of compatible chirality by the self&#8208;sorting. This sensing system may find versatile applications in chiral sensing.

Abstract
A simple and ubiquitously present group, free amine, is used as a directing group to synthesize axially chiral biaryl compounds by PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination. A broad range of axially chiral biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;amines can be obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) proved to be an efficient ligand and the loading could be reduced to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% without erosion of enantiocontrol in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The resulting axially chiral biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;amines also provide a platform for the synthesis of a set of chiral ligands.

      <title>Generation and Reactivity of Amidyl Radicals: Manganese&#8208;Mediated Atom&#8208;Transfer Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the blue: A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven manganese&#8208;mediated protocol for generation of amidyl radicals from amines is described. This novel strategy enables site&#8208;selective chlorination of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of aliphatic amines and intra/intermolecular chloroaminations of unactivated alkenes.

Abstract
A simple and efficient protocol to generate amidyl radicals from amine functionalities through a manganese&#8208;mediated atom&#8208;transfer reaction has been developed. This approach employs an earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive manganese complex, Mn2(CO)10, as the catalyst and visible light as the energy input. Using this strategy, site&#8208;selective chlorination of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of aliphatic amines and intramolecular/intermolecular chloroaminations of unactivated alkenes were readily realized under mild reaction conditions, thus providing efficient access to a range of synthetically valuable alkyl chlorides, chlorinated pyrrolidines, and vicinal chloroamine derivatives. These practical reactions exhibit a broad substrate scope and tolerate a wide array of functional groups, and complex molecules including various marketed drug derivatives.

      <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Complexes Enable Rieske Oxygenase Catalyzed Hydroxylations in Non&#8208;Photosynthetic cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Illuminate me! The photoactivation of Rieske dioxygenases in the absence of glucose or any cofactor was successfully conducted using several photosensitizers for the bioconversion of three different substrates and hence this represents the first example of a photoinduced Rieske system.







Abstract
In this study, we coupled a well&#8208;established whole&#8208;cell system based on E.&#8197;coli via light&#8208;harvesting complexes to Rieske oxygenase (RO)&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylations in vivo. Although these enzymes represent very promising biocatalysts, their practical applicability is hampered by their dependency on NAD(P)H as well as their multicomponent nature and intrinsic instability in cell&#8208;free systems. In order to explore the boundaries of E.&#8197;coli as chassis for artificial photosynthesis, and due to the reported instability of ROs, we used these challenging enzymes as a model system. The light&#8208;driven approach relies on light&#8208;harvesting complexes such as eosin&#8197;Y, 5(6)&#8208;carboxyeosin, and rose bengal and sacrificial electron donors (EDTA, MOPS, and MES) that were easily taken up by the cells. The obtained product formations of up to 1.3&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 and rates of up to 1.6&#8197;mm&#8201;h&#8722;1 demonstrate that this is a comparable approach to typical whole&#8208;cell transformations in E.&#8197;coli. The applicability of this photocatalytic synthesis has been demonstrated and represents the first example of a photoinduced RO system.

      <title>Substrate&#8208;Independent Magnetic Bistability in Monolayers of the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Dy2ScN@C80 on Metals and Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Monolayers of Dy2ScN@C80 exhibit magnetic hysteresis on Au, Ag, and MgO|Ag substrates. The substrates influence the ordering of the endohedral cluster, but does not affect the width of the hysteresis. The carbon cage protects the endohedral magnetic cluster and thus ensures that it sustains magnetic bistability.







Abstract
Magnetic hysteresis is demonstrated for monolayers of the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) Dy2ScN@C80 deposited on Au(111), Ag(100), and MgO|Ag(100) surfaces by vacuum sublimation. The topography and electronic structure of Dy2ScN@C80 adsorbed on Au(111) were studied by STM. X&#8208;ray magnetic CD studies show that the Dy2ScN@C80 monolayers exhibit similarly broad magnetic hysteresis independent on the substrate used, but the orientation of the Dy2ScN cluster depends strongly on the surface. DFT calculations show that the extent of the electronic interaction of the fullerene molecules with the surface is increasing dramatically from MgO to Au(111) and Ag(100). However, the charge redistribution at the fullerene&#8208;surface interface is fully absorbed by the carbon cage, leaving the state of the endohedral cluster intact. This Faraday cage effect of the fullerene preserves the magnetic bistability of fullerene&#8208;SMMs on conducting substrates and facilitates their application in molecular spintronics.

      <title>Stable Salts of Heteroleptic Iron Carbonyl/Nitrosyl Cations</title>
      <dc:description>
Ready to use&#8230;! Two novel iron carbonyl/nitrosyl cations in the elusive oxidation state +I are now easily accessible as stable salts of the weakly coordinating anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. They may serve as simple model systems for the investigation of the nature of the Fe&#8722;NO bond to further understand the (bio&#8208;)chemistry of iron nitrosyl complexes.







Abstract
The oxidation of Fe(CO)5 with the [NO]+ salt of the weakly coordinating perfluoroalkoxyaluminate anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) leads to stable salts of the 18&#8197;valence electron (VE) species [Fe(CO)4(NO)]+ and [Fe(CO)(NO)3]+ with the Enemark&#8211;Feltham numbers of {FeNO}8 and {FeNO}10. This finally concludes the triad of heteroleptic iron carbonyl/nitrosyl complexes, since the first discovery of the anionic ([Fe(CO)3(NO)]&#8722;) and neutral ([Fe(CO)2(NO)2]) species over 80&#8197;years ago. Both complexes were fully characterized (IR, Raman, NMR, UV/Vis, scXRD, pXRD) and are stable at room temperature under inert conditions over months and may serve as useful starting materials for further investigations.

      <title>Dimensional Reduction of Cs2AgBiBr6: A 2D Hybrid Double Perovskite with Strong Polarization Sensitivity</title>
      <dc:description>
A lead&#8208;free hybrid double perovskite, (i&#8208;PA)2AgBiCsBr7, has been designed through dimensional reduction of the 3D prototype of Cs2AgBiBr6. Its unique quantum&#8208;confined 2D bilayered motif results in the natural anisotropy of physical attributes, which accounts for its polarization&#8208;sensitive response with large dichroic ratios.







Abstract
By dimensional reduction of the 3D motif of Cs2AgBiBr6, a lead&#8208;free 2D hybrid double perovskite, (i&#8208;PA)2CsAgBiBr7 (1, i&#8208;PA=isopentylammonium), was successfully designed. It adopts a quantum&#8208;confined bilayered structure with alternating organic and inorganic sheets. Strikingly, the unique 2D architecture endows it highly anisotropic nature of physical properties, including electric conductivity and optical absorption (the ratio &#945;b/&#945;c=1.9 at 405&#8197;nm). Such anisotropy attributes result in the strong polarization&#8208;sensitive responses with large dichroic ratios up to 1.35, being comparable to some 2D inorganic materials. This is the first study on the hybrid double perovskites with strong polarization sensitivity. A crystal device of 1 also exhibits rapid response speed (ca. 200&#8197;&#956;s) and excellent stabilities. The family of 2D hybrid double perovskites are promising optoelectronic candidates, and this work paves a new pathway for exploring new green polarization&#8208;sensitive materials.

      <title>Image&#8208;Based Morphological Profiling Identifies a Lysosomotropic, Iron&#8208;Sequestering Autophagy Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>
I heard you paint cells: Morphological profiling using the &#8220;cell painting&#8221; assay revealed that autoquin impairs lysosomal integrity, iron homeostasis, and autophagy.







Abstract
Chemical proteomics is widely applied in small&#8208;molecule target identification. However, in general it does not identify non&#8208;protein small&#8208;molecule targets, and thus, alternative methods for target identification are in high demand. We report the discovery of the autophagy inhibitor autoquin and the identification of its molecular mode of action using image&#8208;based morphological profiling in the cell painting assay. A compound&#8208;induced fingerprint representing changes in 579 cellular parameters revealed that autoquin accumulates in lysosomes and inhibits their fusion with autophagosomes. In addition, autoquin sequesters Fe2+ in lysosomes, resulting in an increase of lysosomal reactive oxygen species and ultimately cell death. Such a mechanism of action would have been challenging to unravel by current methods. This work demonstrates the potential of the cell painting assay to deconvolute modes of action of small molecules, warranting wider application in chemical biology.

      <title>High&#8208;Resolution Electrochemical Mapping of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenide Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanoscale electrochemical cell: Understanding the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanism of MoS2 nanosheets requires a comprehensive understanding of the quantitative electrochemical properties and the distribution of active sites in real space. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is used to image and quantitatively analyze HER catalytically active sites in 1H MoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is used to image and quantitatively analyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytically active sites of 1H&#8208;MoS2 nanosheets, MoS2, and WS2 heteronanosheets. Using a 20&#8197;nm radius nanopipette and hopping mode scanning, the resolution of SECCM was beyond the optical microscopy limit and visualized a small triangular MoS2 nanosheet with a side length of ca. 130&#8197;nm. The electrochemical cell provides local cyclic voltammograms with a nanoscale spatial resolution for visualizing HER active sites as electrochemical images. The HER activity difference of edge, terrace, and heterojunction of MoS2 and WS2 were revealed. The SECCM imaging directly visualized the relationship of HER activity and number of MoS2 nanosheet layers and unveiled the heterogeneous aging state of MoS2 nanosheets. SECCM can be used for improving local HER activities by producing sulfur vacancies using electrochemical reaction at the selected region.

A neutral hybrid macrocycle with two trans&#8208;positioned N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and two pyridine donors hosts copper in three oxidation states (+I&#8211;+III) in a series of structurally characterized complexes (1&#8211;3). Redox interconversion of [LCu]+/2+/3+ is electrochemically (quasi)reversible and occurs at moderate potentials (E1/2=&#8722;0.45&#8197;V and +0.82&#8197;V (vs. Fc/Fc+)). A linear CNHC&#8208;Cu&#8208;CNHC arrangement and hemilability of the two pyridine donors allows the ligand to adapt to the different stereoelectronic and coordination requirements of CuI versus CuII/CuIII. Analytical methods such as NMR, UV/Vis, IR, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Cu K&#946; high&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution fluorescence detection X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations, give insight into the geometric and electronic structures of the complexes. The XAS signatures of 1&#8211;3 are textbook examples for CuI, CuII, and CuIII species. Facile 2&#8208;electron interconversion combined with the exposure of two basic pyridine N sites in the reduced CuI form suggest that [LCu]+/2+/3+ may operate in catalysis via coupled 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ transfer.

More than 110 h of lithium plating life is achieved in Li/Li cell tests, which is among the longest cycle life of lithium metal anode and five times longer than that of blank separators. This new aspect of morphological and mechanical design combining both theoretical understanding and experimental results not only provides an alternative pathway for extending lifetime of lithium metal anodes, but also sheds a light on the role of separator engineering for various electrochemical energy storage devices .</dc:description>

      <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;induced Hyperpolarization of Gases</title>
      <dc:description>Imaging of gases is a major challenge for any modality including MRI. NMR and MRI signals are directly proportional to the nuclear spin density and the degree of alignment of nuclear spins with applied static magnetic field, which is called nuclear spin polarization. The level of nuclear spin polarization is typically very low,  i.e  ., one hundred thousandth of the potential maximum at 1.5 T and a physiologically relevant temperature. As a result, MRI typically focusses on imaging highly concentrated tissue water.

      <title>Engineering Iron&#8208;Nickel Nanoparticles for Magnetically&#8208;Induced CO2 Methanation in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>Induction heating of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) has been recently explored as a new methodology to activate heterogeneous catalytic reactions. This approach requires the design and the synthesis of nano&#8208;objects displaying both a high heating power and an excellent catalytic activity. Here, using a surface engineering approach, we report for the first time the use of bimetallic NPs for magnetically&#8208;induced CO2 methanation which acts both as heating agent and as catalyst. Thus, we describe the organometallic synthesis of Fe30Ni70 NPs, displaying high heating powers at low magnetic field amplitudes. These NPs are active but only slightly selective for CH4 after deposition on SirAlOx due to the presence of an iron rich shell (25 mL&#183;min&#8208;1, 25 mT, 300 kHz, conversion 71%, methane selectivity 65%). Remarkably, a proper surface engineering consisting in depositing a thin Ni layer leads to Fe30Ni70@Ni NPs displaying a very high activity for CO2 hydrogenation and a full selectivity. For the first time, a quantitative yield in methane is obtained at low magnetic field and mild conditions (25 mL&#183;min&#8208;1, 19 mT, 300 kHz, conversion 100%, methane selectivity 100%).</dc:description>

      <title>Complete Switch of Directional Selectivity in the Formal Hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Enynes with Simple Hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling reaction selectivity is a permanent pursuit for chemists. In particular, regio&#8208;selective catalysis, which exploits and/or overcomes innate steric and electronic bias to deliver diverse regio&#8208;enriched products from the same starting materials, represents a powerful tool for divergent synthesis. Recently,  our group reported the 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with simple hydrazones to generate branched allylic compounds when a nickel catalyst was used. As part of the effort, herein we show that a complete switch of Markovnikov to anti&#8208;Markovnikov directionality is obtained by slightly changing to a ruthenium catalyst, thus providing a direct and efficient access to the homoallylic products exclusively.  Isotopic substitution experiments indicate that no reversible hydro&#8208;metallation across the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl system occurred under ruthenium catalysis. Moreover, this protocol is also applicable to the regio&#8208;specific hydro&#8208;alkylation of the distal C=C bond of 1,3&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Highly stable coordination cages with trinuclear zirconium vertices and flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers were formed by self&#8208;assembly. The two water&#8208;stable cages exhibit impressive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics contributed by the molecular rotors and can be employed as biological fluorescent probes for live&#8208;cell imaging.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of highly stable zirconium(IV)&#8208;based coordination cages with aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecular rotors for in&#8197;vitro bio&#8208;imaging is reported. The two coordination cages, NUS&#8208;100 and NUS&#8208;101, are assembled from the highly stable trinuclear zirconium vertices and two flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers. Extensive experimental and theoretical results show that the emissive intensity of the coordination cages can be controlled by restricting the dynamics of AIE&#8208;active molecular rotors though multiple external stimuli. Because the two coordination cages have excellent chemical stability in aqueous solutions (pH stability: 2&#8211;10) and impressive AIE characteristics contributed by the molecular rotors, they can be employed as novel biological fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vitro live&#8208;cell imaging.

      <title>Biosynthesis of the N&#8211;N&#8208;Bond&#8208;Containing Compound l&#8208;Alanosine</title>
      <dc:description>
A means to an N&#8722;N: Among N&#8208;N&#8208;bond&#8208;containing compounds, biosynthetic routes to diazeniumdiolates remain enigmatic. The biosynthetic pathway for the diazeniumdiolate&#8208;containing amino acid l&#8208;alanosine was elucidated. The two nitrogen atoms in the diazeniumdiolate of l&#8208;alanosine are shown to be derived from glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and the early steps of the biosynthetic pathway were elucidated by using both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo approaches.







Abstract
The formation of a N&#8722;N bond is a unique biochemical transformation, and nature employs diverse biosynthetic strategies to activate nitrogen for bond formation. Among molecules that contain a N&#8722;N bond, biosynthetic routes to diazeniumdiolates remain enigmatic. We here report the biosynthetic pathway for the diazeniumdiolate&#8208;containing amino acid l&#8208;alanosine. Our work reveals that the two nitrogen atoms in the diazeniumdiolate of l&#8208;alanosine arise from glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and we clarify the early steps of the biosynthetic pathway by using both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo approaches. Our work demonstrates a peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein&#8208;based mechanism for activation of the precursor l&#8208;diaminopropionate, and we also show that nitric oxide can participate in non&#8208;enzymatic diazeniumdiolate formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gene alnA, which encodes a fusion protein with an N&#8208;terminal cupin domain and a C&#8208;terminal AraC&#8208;like DNA&#8208;binding domain, is required for alanosine biosynthesis.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Selective Defluoroborylation of Polyfluoroarenes, gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes, and Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
A practical and selective defluoroborylation of polyfluoroarenes, gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, and trifluoromethylalkenes was developed through photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;induced B&#8722;H activation to synthesize fluorinated organoboranes as the building blocks for value&#8208;added organofluorine compounds.







Abstract
Fluorinated organoboranes serve as versatile synthetic precursors for the preparation of value&#8208;added fluorinated organic compounds. Recent progress has been mainly focused on the transition&#8208;metal catalyzed defluoroborylation. Herein, we report a photocatalytic defluoroborylation platform through direct B&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene boranes, through the synergistic merger of a photoredox catalyst and a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. This atom&#8208;economic and operationally simple protocol has enabled defluoroborylation of an extremely broad scope of multifluorinated substrates including polyfluoroarenes, gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, and trifluoromethylalkenes in a highly selective fashion. Intriguingly, the defluoroborylation protocol can be transition&#8208;metal free, and the regioselectivity obtained is complementary to the reported transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis in many cases.

      <title>Radical Dehydroxymethylative Fluorination of Carbohydrates and Divergent Transformations of the Resulting Reverse Glycosyl Fluorides</title>
      <dc:description>
Sweet fluorination: The radical dehydroxymethylative fluorination of carbohydrate alcohols affords a wide arrange of reverse glycosyl fluorides (RGFs) in good to excellent yields. Catalytic C&#8722;F bond activation of these products and further transformations with various nucleophiles demonstrate the potential of this method in late&#8208;stage carbohydrate diversification.







Abstract
A mild and convenient method for the synthesis of reverse glycosyl fluorides (RGFs) has been developed that is based on the silver&#8208;promoted radical dehydroxymethylative fluorination of carbohydrates. A salient feature of the reaction is that furanoid and pyranoid carbohydrates furnish structurally diverse RGFs bearing a wide variety of functional groups in good to excellent yields. Intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer experiments revealed that the reaction involves an underexploited radical fluorination that proceeds via &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of sugar&#8208;derived primary alkoxyl radicals. Structurally divergent RGFs were obtained by catalytic C&#8722;F bond activation, and our method thus offers a concise and efficient strategy for the synthesis of reverse glycosides by late&#8208;stage diversification of RGFs. The potential of this method is showcased by the preparation and diversification of sotagliflozin, leading to the discovery of a promising SGLT2 inhibitor candidate.

Intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer experiments revealed that the reaction involves an underexploited radical fluorination that proceeds via &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of sugar&#8208;derived primary alkoxyl radicals. Structurally divergent RGFs were obtained by catalytic C&#8722;F bond activation, and our method thus offers a concise and efficient strategy for the synthesis of reverse glycosides by late&#8208;stage diversification of RGFs. The potential of this method is showcased by the preparation and diversification of sotagliflozin, leading to the discovery of a promising SGLT2 inhibitor candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphanylalanes and Phosphanylgallanes Stabilized only by a Lewis Base</title>
      <dc:description>
Back to bases: The first parent phosphanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes stabilized only by a Lewis base were synthesized. These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl and LiPH2&#8901;DME and a H2 elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H3 and PH3, respectively.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the first parent phosphanylalane and phosphanylgallane stabilized only by a Lewis base (LB) are reported. The corresponding substituted compounds, such as IDipp&#8901;GaH2PCy2 (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were obtained by the reaction of LiPCy2 with IDipp&#8901;GaH2Cl. However, the LB&#8208;stabilized parent compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH2PH2 (3) and IDipp&#8901;AlH2PH2 (4) were prepared via a salt metathesis of LiPH2&#8901;DME with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) or by H2&#8208;elimination reactions of IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H3 (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) and PH3, respectively. The compounds could be isolated as crystalline solids and completely characterized. Supporting DFT computations gave insight into the reaction pathways as well as into the stability of these compounds with respect to their decomposition behavior.

      <title>Molecularly Engineered Macrophage&#8208;Derived Exosomes with Inflammation Tropism and Intrinsic Heme Biosynthesis for Atherosclerosis Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes molecularly engineered with the drug hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) can actively target and transmigrate to atherosclerotic lesions, wherein the biosynthesis and metabolism of heme induced by HAL produces CO and bilirubin. This, along with the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in exosomes, acts to significantly alleviate atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases worldwide, and alleviating inflammation is a promising strategy for AS treatment. Here, we report molecularly engineered M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M2 Exo) with inflammation&#8208;tropism and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities for AS imaging and therapy. M2 Exo are derived from M2 macrophages and further electroporated with FDA&#8208;approved hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL). After systematic administration, the engineered M2 Exo exhibit excellent inflammation&#8208;tropism and anti&#8208;inflammation effects via the surface&#8208;bonded chemokine receptors and the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines released from the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages. Moreover, the encapsulated HAL can undergo intrinsic biosynthesis and metabolism of heme to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide and bilirubin, which further enhance the anti&#8208;inflammation effects and finally alleviate AS. Meanwhile, the intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) of the heme biosynthesis pathway permits the fluorescence imaging and tracking of AS.

      <title>Uncovering the Shuttle Effect in Organic Batteries and Counter&#8208;Strategies Thereof: A Case Study of the N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dimethylphenazine Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>
Whodunnit? The detrimental shuttle effect in organic batteries is proposed to be based on electron hopping through a self&#8208;exchange process, rather than by molecular diffusion as conventionally understood. The findings have led to two counter&#8208;strategies to inhibit this shuttle mechanism.







Abstract
The main drawback of organic electrode materials is their solubility in the electrolyte, leading to the shuttle effect. Using N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylphenazine (DMPZ) as a highly soluble cathode material, and its PF6&#8722; and triflimide salts as models for its first oxidation state, a poor correlation was found between solubility and battery operability. Extensive electrochemical experiments suggest that the shuttle effect is unlikely to be mediated by molecular diffusion as commonly understood, but rather by electron&#8208;hopping via the electron self&#8208;exchange reaction based on spectroscopic results. These findings led to two counter&#8208;strategies to prevent the hopping process: the pre&#8208;treatment of the anode to form a solid&#8211;electrolyte interface and using DMPZ salt rather than neutral DMPZ as the active material. These strategies improved coulombic efficiency and capacity retention, demonstrating that solubility of organic materials does not necessarily exclude their applications in batteries.

      <title>Molecular&#8208;Sieving Membrane by Partitioning the Channels in Ultrafiltration Membrane by In&#8197;Situ Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Confined&#8208;polymerization partitioning in commercial ultrafiltration membrane pores is reported to prepare gas molecular&#8208;sieving membranes. Besides remarkable hydrogen purification performance, outstanding long&#8208;term stability and aging resistance are achieved owing to the creation of intrinsic micropores by crosslinking of multi&#8208;functionalized rigid building units.







Abstract
Commercial ultrafiltration membranes have proliferated globally for water treatment. However, their pore sizes are too large to sieve gases. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) feature well&#8208;developed microporosity yet are difficult to be fabricated into membranes. Herein, we report a strategy to prepare molecular&#8208;sieving membranes by partitioning the mesoscopic channels in water ultrafiltration membrane (PSU) into ultra&#8208;micropores by space&#8208;confined polymerization of multi&#8208;functionalized rigid building units. Nine CMP@PSU membranes were obtained, and their separation performance for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 pairs surpass the Robeson upper bound and rival against the best of those reported membranes. Furthermore, highly crosslinked skeletons inside the channels result in the structural robustness and transfer into the excellent aging resistance of the CMP@PSU. This strategy may shed light on the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes.

      <title>A Supported Bismuth Halide Perovskite Photocatalyst for Selective Aliphatic and Aromatic C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Better with bismuth: A range of mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;supported small bismuth halide perovskite nanoparticles were prepared. They were found to be very promising photocatalysts for selective aromatic and aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Direct selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to oxygenates by O2 is challenging. Catalysts are limited by the low activity and narrow application scope, and the main focus is on active C&#8722;H bonds at benzylic positions. In this work, stable, lead&#8208;free, Cs3Bi2Br9 halide perovskites are integrated within the pore channels of mesoporous SBA&#8208;15 silica and demonstrate their photocatalytic potentials for C&#8722;H bond activation. The composite photocatalysts can effectively oxidize hydrocarbons (C5 to C16 including aromatic and aliphatic alkanes) with a conversion rate up to 32900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and excellent selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) towards aldehydes and ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Isotopic labeling, in&#8197;situ spectroscopic studies, and DFT calculations reveal that well&#8208;dispersed small perovskite nanoparticles (2&#8211;5&#8197;nm) possess enhanced electron&#8211;hole separation and a close contact with hydrocarbons that facilitates C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photoinduced charges.

Isotopic labeling, in&#8197;situ spectroscopic studies, and DFT calculations reveal that well&#8208;dispersed small perovskite nanoparticles (2&#8211;5&#8197;nm) possess enhanced electron&#8211;hole separation and a close contact with hydrocarbons that facilitates C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond activation by photoinduced charges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phenol&#8208;Derived Carbon Sealant Inspired by a Coalification Process</title>
      <dc:description>
The phenol&#8208;derived carbon sealant inspired by the coalification process was developed by thermal annealing of a polyphenolic compounds. The compounds undergo oxidation for surface functionalization and the reductive annealing for developing electrically conductive properties. The resulting sealant, which is a conductive graphitic carbon material, can seal graphene fragments physically and electrically.







Abstract
Recently, emerging functions utilizing phenolic molecules, such as surface functionalizing agents or bioadhesives, have attracted significant interest. However, the most important role of phenolic compounds is to produce carbonized plant matter called &#8220;coal&#8221;, which is widely used as an energy source in nearly all countries. Coalification is a long&#8208;term, high&#8208;temperature process in which phenols are converted into conducting carbonized matter. This study focuses on mimicking coalification processes to create conducting sealants from non&#8208;conducting phenolic compounds by heat treatment. We demonstrate that a phenolic adhesive, tri&#8208;hydroxybenzene (known as pyrogallol), and polyethylenimine mixture initially acts as an adhesive sealant that can be converted to a conducting carbon sealing material. The conductivity of the phenolic sealant is about 850&#8197;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement of the performance of carbon matter. Applications of the biomimetic adhesives described herein include conducting defect sealants in carbon nanomaterials and conducting binders for metal/carbon or ceramic/carbon composites.

      <title>Enriching and Quantifying Porous Single Layer 2D Polymers by Exfoliation of Chemically Modified van der Waals Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D polymer with pyrylium groups is transformed into a 2D polymer with pyridine groups by exposure to gaseous ammonia. Liquid phase exfoliation of the latter yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Nanosheet quantification shows that the exfoliation is comparable to graphite, demonstrating the promising potential of this approach, which could also be applied to covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
2D polymer sheets with six positively charged pyrylium groups at each pore edge in a stacked single crystal can be transformed into a 2D polymer with six pyridines per pore by exposure to gaseous ammonia. This reaction furnishes still a crystalline material with tunable protonation degree at regular nano&#8208;sized pores promising as separation membrane. The exfoliation is compared for both 2D polymers with the latter being superior. Its liquid phase exfoliation yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Monolayer contents of &#8776;30&#8201;% are achieved with &#8776;130&#8197;nm sized sheets in mg quantities, corresponding to tens of trillions of monolayers. Quantification of nanosheet sizes, layer number and mass shows that this exfoliation is comparable to graphite. Thus, we expect that recent advances in exfoliation of graphite or inorganic crystals (e.g. scale&#8208;up, printing etc.) can be directly applied to this 2D polymer as well as to covalent organic frameworks.

While topological quantum materials such as topological insulator (TI) or topological crystalline insulator (TCI) can exhibit high &#181;, weak topological insulators (WTI) are of interest due to their layered hetero&#8208;structural nature which is intriguing for exhibiting low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat). BiTe, a unique member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series (where m:n = 1:2), possesses both the quantum states, TCI and WTI, which is distinct from the conventional strong TI, Bi2Te3 (where m:n = 0:1). In BiTe, Bi&#8208;Bi zigzag bilayer is sandwiched between the Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te quintuple layers bonded via weak van der Waals interactions. Here, we report intrinsically low &#954;lat of 0.47&#8208; 0.8 W/mK in the 300&#8208;650 K range in BiTe due to the presence of low energy optical phonon branches which originate primarily from the localized vibrations of Bi bilayer. These soft optical modes couple strongly with the acoustic modes, hindering the propagation of acoustic phonons, resulting in a low &#954;lat. BiTe exhibits negative Seebeck coefficients attributing to n&#8208;type electronic conduction. BiTe possesses high &#181; of ~ 516 cm2/Vs and 707 cm2/Vs along parallel and perpendicular to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) directions, respectively, at room temperature. Electronic structure of BiTe reveals that multiple band extrema in the conduction bands with nearly linear dispersion in a narrow energy window (~25 meV) corresponding to the thermal energy at room temperature, resulting in a facile conduction channel; hence supports manifestation of high &#181;.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulation of Prins Cyclization by Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;molecule strong coupling has emerged within the last decade as an entirely new method to control chemical reactions.

While the potential of VSC in organic chemistry appears enormous, only a limited number of reactions have been investigated under VSC to date, including solvolysis and deprotection reactions. Here we investigate the effect of VSC on a series of aldehydes and ketones undergoing Prins cyclization, an important synthetic step in pharmaceutical chemistry. We observe a decrease of the second&#8208;order rate constant with VSC of the reactant carbonyl stretching groups. We measure an increased activation energy due to VSC, but proportional changes in activation enthalpy and entropy suggest no substantive change in reaction pathway.

      <title>Phosphorus vacancies boost electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution by two orders of magnitude</title>
      <dc:description>Vacancy engineering is an effective strategy to manipulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their performance; while few reports focus on phosphorus vacancies (Pv). Herein, we report the creation of Pv in metal phosphides and investigate their role in alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Pv&#8208;modified catalyst requires a minimum onset potential of 0 mV vs RHE, a small overpotential of 27.7 mV to achieve 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  geometric current density and a Tafel slope of 30.88 mV dec  &#8208;1  , even outperforms Pt/C benchmark (32.7 mV@10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 30.90 mV dec  &#8208;1  ). This catalyst also displays superior stability up to 504 hours without any decay. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest Pv can weaken the hybridization of Ni 3d and P 2p orbitals, enriching the electron density of Ni and P atoms nearby Pv, facilitating H* desorption process, contributing to outstanding HER activity and facile kinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes: High Sterically Derived Selectivity from a Pyridyl&#8208;Imidazoline Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>The steric effects of substituents on five&#8208;membered rings are less pronounced than those on six&#8208;membered rings because of the difference in bond angles. Thus, the regioselectivities of reactions that occur with selectivities dictated by steric effects, such as the borylation of C&#8208;H bonds, have been poor in many cases. We report that the silylation of five&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes occurs with high sterically derived regioselectivity when catalyzed by the combination of [Ir(cod)(OMe)]  2  and a phenanthroline ligand or a new pyridyl&#8208;imidazoline ligand that further increases the regioselectivity. The silylation reactions with these catalysts produce high yields of heteroarylsilanes from functionalization at the most sterically accessible C&#8211;H bonds of these rings under conditions that the borylation of C&#8211;H bonds with previously reported catalysts formed mixtures of products or products that are unstable. The heteroarylsilane products undergo cross&#8208;coupling reactions and substitution reactions with  ipso  selectivity to generate heteroarenes that bear halogen, aryl and perfluoroalkyl substituents.</dc:description>

      <title>Intracellular Electrochemical Nanomeasurements Reveal that Exocytosis of Molecules at Living Neurons is Subquantal and Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Since the early work of Bernard Katz, the process of cellular chemical communication via exocytosis, quantal release, has been considered to be all or none. Recent evidence has shown exocytosis to be partial or &#8216;subquantal&#8217; at single&#8208;cell model systems, but there is a need to understand this at communicating nerve cells. Partial release allows nerve cells to control the signal at the site of release during individual events, where the smaller the fraction released, the greater the range of regulation. Here we show that the fraction of the vesicular octopamine content released from a living&#160;  Drosophila  &#160;larval neuromuscular neuron is very small. The percentage of released molecules was found to be only 4.5% for simple events and 10.7% for complex (i.e., oscillating or flickering) events. This large content, combined with partial release controlled by fluctuations of the fusion pore, offers presynaptic plasticity that can be widely regulated.</dc:description>

Results obtained with the anti&#8208;z&#8208;COSY sequence at 100 kHz MAS on thymol,&#160; &#946; &#8208;AspAla, and strychnine &#160;show an improvement in resolution of up to a factor of two compared to conventional spectra acquired at the same spinning rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Structural Modification of Triphenylamine Derivatives vs the Minimization of Carrier Losses for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells.</title>
      <dc:description>Three hole transport materials (HTMs) based on a substituted triphenylamine moiety have been synthetized and successfully employed in triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide PSCs, reaching efficiencies of 19.4%. The efficiencies, comparable to those obtained using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, point them out as promising candidates for easily attainable and cost&#8208;effective alternatives for PSCs, given their facile synthesis from commercially available materials. Interestingly, although all these HTMs present close chemical and physical properties, they provide different carrier recombination kinetics. Our results demonstrate that is feasible through the molecular design of the HTM to minimize carrier losses and, thus, increase the solar cell efficiencies.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Generally, enzymes contain several subunits to maintain different biological functions in live systems. However, it still remains a great challenge for specific discrimination of one subunit over another. Toward this end, we present the first fluorescent probe TPEMA for highly specific detection of B subunit of cytosolic creatine (CK) kinase isoenzyme (CK&#8208;B). Due to its aggregation&#8208;induced emission property, TPEMA shows highly boosted emission toward CK&#8208;B with fast response time and very low interference from other analytes including M subunit of CK (CK&#8208;M). With the aid of Job's plot assay, ITC assay and molecular dynamics simulation, for the first time we directly confirmed that the remarkably enhanced fluorescence of TPEMA in the presence of CK&#8208;B results from the restriction of single molecular motion in the cavity. Selective wash&#8208;free fluorescence imaging of CK&#8208;B in macrophages under different treatments was successfully demonstrated. This work can shed much light on future fluorescent probes for light&#8208;up detection of other subunit&#8208;specific enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Li/Garnet Interface Stabilization by Thermal&#8208;decomposition Vapor Deposition of an Amorphous Carbon Layer</title>
      <dc:description>Applying interlayers is the main strategy to address the large area specific resistance (ASR) of Li/garnet interface. However, studies on eliminating the Li  2  CO  3  and LiOH interfacial lithiophobic contaminants are still insufficient. Here, we propose thermal&#8208;decomposition vapor deposition (TVD) of a carbon modification layer on Li  6.75  La  3  Zr  1.75  Ta  0.25  O  12  (LLZTO), which provides a contaminant&#8208;free surface. Due to the protection of the carbon layer, the air stability of LLZTO is also improved. Moreover, owing to the amorphous structure of the low graphitized carbon (LGC), instant lithiation is achieved, and the ASR of the Li/LLZTO interface is reduced to 9 &#937; cm  2  . Lithium volatilization and Zr  4+  reduction are also controllable during TVD. Compared with its high graphitized carbon counterpart (HGC), the LGC&#8208;modified Li/LLZTO interface displays a higher critical current density of 1.2 mA/cm  2  , as well as moderate Li plating and stripping, which provides enhanced polarization voltage stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Macfarlandin C, a Spongian Diterpenoid Harboring a Concave&#8208;Substituted cis&#8208;Dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanone Fragment</title>
      <dc:description>The enantioselective total synthesis of the rearranged spongian diterpenoid (&#8211;)&#8208;macfarlandin C is reported. This is the first synthesis of a rearranged spongian diterpenoid in which the bulky hydrocarbon fragment is joined via a quaternary carbon to the highly hindered concave face of the cis&#8208;2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. The strategy involves a late&#8208;stage fragment coupling between a tertiary carbon radical and an electrophilic butenolide resulting in the stereoselective formation of vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters. A stereoselective Mukaiyama hydration that orients a pendant carboxymethyl side chain cis to the bulky octahydronapthalene substituent was pivotal in fashioning the challenging concave&#8208;substituted cis&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanone fragment.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Direct Aldol Addition of Aryl Ketones to &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated chiral tertiary alcohols from (hetero)aryl methyl ketones is described. The use of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase was found to facilitate direct aldol addition by providing the strong Br&#248;nsted basicity required for rapid aryl enolate formation. The new synthetic protocol is easy to perform and tolerates a broad range of functionalities and heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er). Multi&#8208;gram scalability has been demonstrated along with catalyst recovery and recycling. NMR studies identified a 1400&#8208;fold rate enhancement under BIMP catalysis, compared to the current state of the art catalytic system. The utility of the aldol products has been highlighted with the synthesis of various enantioenriched building blocks and heterocycles, including 1,3&#8208;aminoalcohol, 1,3&#8208;diol, oxetane and isoxazoline derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Approaching the Integer&#8208;Charge Transfer Regime in Molecularly Doped Oligothiophenes by Efficient Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A library of symmetrical linear oligothiophene has been prepared employing decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key transformation. We utilized thiophene potassium carboxylate salts as cross&#8208;coupling partners without the need of co&#8208;catalyst, base, or additives. This method demonstrates complete chemoselectivity and is a comprehensive greener approach compared to the existing methodologies. The modularity of this approach is demonstrated with the preparation of discreet oligothiophenes with up to 10 thiophene repeat units. Symmetrical oligothiophenes represent prototypical organic semiconductors and allow us to spectroscopically assess their response to molecular electrical doping regarding the degree of charge transfer as a function of the chain length. We find evidence that the critical length for integer charge transfer as it is found in the polythiophene limit to be not more than 10 thiophene units, which highlights the potential of long discreet oligothiophenes for their use in organic electronic applications as doped conduction or injection layers.</dc:description>
