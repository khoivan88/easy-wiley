      <title>An Excimer Clamp for Measuring Damaged&#8208;Base Excision by the DNA Repair Enzyme NTH1</title>
      <dc:description>
Clamping down on DNA damage: Direct measurement of NTH1 glycosylase activity is of interest for the study of this DNA repair pathway and related diseases. A DNA&#8208;probe design for glycosylase activity is reported that relies on a &#8220;clamp&#8221; of pyrenes and shows a robust ratiometric response. The activity of NTH1 is measured both in&#8197;vitro and in cell lysates, and a selective inhibitor of NTH1 is identified by high&#8208;throughput screening.







Abstract
Direct measurement of DNA repair enzyme activities is important both for the basic study of cellular repair pathways as well as for potential new translational applications in their associated diseases. NTH1, a major glycosylase targeting oxidized pyrimidines, prevents mutations arising from this damage, and the regulation of NTH1 activity is important in resisting oxidative stress and in suppressing tumor formation. Herein, we describe a novel molecular strategy for the direct detection of damaged DNA base excision activity by a ratiometric fluorescence change. This strategy utilizes glycosylase&#8208;induced excimer formation of pyrenes, and modified DNA probes, incorporating two pyrene deoxynucleotides and a damaged base, enable the direct, real&#8208;time detection of NTH1 activity in&#8197;vitro and in cellular lysates. The probe design was also applied in screening for potential NTH1 inhibitors, leading to the identification of a new small&#8208;molecule inhibitor with sub&#8208;micromolar potency.

      <title>Bacterial Autoimmune Drug Metabolism Transforms an Immunomodulator into Structurally and Functionally Divergent Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Antimicrobials on tap: The stilbene tapinarof, a drug used to treat inflammatory skin diseases, is transformed into two novel dimers in Photorhabdus. A cupin enzyme contributes to the oxidative dimerization of tapinarof and other dietary stilbenes. While tapinarof significantly reduces severe colitis symptoms in a mouse model, the dimers display antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium and the antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens MRSA and VRE.







Abstract
Tapinarof is a stilbene drug that is used to treat psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and is thought to function through regulation of the AhR and Nrf2 signaling pathways, which have also been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases. It is produced by the gammaproteobacterial Photorhabdus genus, which thus represents a model to probe tapinarof structural and functional transformations. We show that Photorhabdus transforms tapinarof into novel drug metabolism products that kill inflammatory bacteria, and that a cupin enzyme contributes to the conversion of tapinarof and related dietary stilbenes into novel dimers. One dimer has activity against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and another undergoes spontaneous cyclizations to a cyclopropane&#8208;bridge&#8208;containing hexacyclic framework that exhibits activity against Mycobacterium. These dimers lack efficacy in a colitis mouse model, whereas the monomer reduces disease symptoms.

      <title>Tandem Insertion&#8211;[1,3]&#8208;Rearrangement: Highly Enantioselective Construction of &#945;&#8208;Aminoketones</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective tandem O&#8722;H insertion&#8211;[1,3]&#8208;alkyl shift reaction of benzylic alcohols and rhodium azavinyl carbenoids was developed by using relay catalysis of dirhodium(II) carboxylates and chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;indium(III) complex. This strategy provides an efficient and succinct access to structurally diverse chiral &#945;&#8208;aminoketones with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoketone derivatives were readily available through a tandem insertion&#8211;[1,3] O&#8208;to&#8208;C rearrangement reaction. The rhodium salt and chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;indium(III) complex make up relay catalysis, which enables the O&#8722;H insertion of benzylic alcohols to N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, and asymmetric [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of amino enol ether intermediates, subsequently.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Tandem Insertion&#8211;[1,3]&#8208;Rearrangement: Highly Enantioselective Construction of &#945;&#8208;Aminoketones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A highly enantioselective&lt;/b&gt; tandem O&#8722;H insertion&#8211;[1,3]&#8208;alkyl shift reaction of benzylic alcohols and rhodium azavinyl carbenoids was developed by using relay catalysis of dirhodium(II) carboxylates and chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;indium(III) complex. This strategy provides an efficient and succinct access to structurally diverse chiral &#945;&#8208;aminoketones with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoketone derivatives were readily available through a tandem insertion&#8211;[1,3] O&#8208;to&#8208;C rearrangement reaction. The rhodium salt and chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;indium(III) complex make up relay catalysis, which enables the O&#8722;H insertion of benzylic alcohols to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, and asymmetric [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of amino enol ether intermediates, subsequently. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that the [1,3] O&#8208;to&#8208;C rearrangement step proceeded through an ion pair pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we report how thiophene&#8208;based trimeric structures with naphthoquinone or hydroquinone redox&#8208;active pendent groups can be processed in solution, deposited, dried and subsequently polymerized in solid state to form conductive (redox) polymer layers without any additives.

By employing these materials as anode and cathode in an acidic aqueous electrolyte a rocking&#8208;chair proton battery is built. The battery shows good cycling stability (85% after 500 cycles), withstands rapid charging, with full capacity (60 mAh/g) reached within 100 seconds, allows for direct integration with photovoltaics, and retains its favorable characteristics even at &#8208;24 &#176;C.</dc:description>

The first dual nickel/photoredox catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling was developed. The advantages of this reaction include no preformed nucleophiles, no metal reductant, and excellent scope.







Abstract
A unique nickel/organic photoredox co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;chloro esters and aryl iodides is developed. This cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction employs an organic reductant (Hantzsch ester), whereas most reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions use stoichiometric metals. A diverse array of valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl esters is formed under these conditions with high enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 88&#8201;%). &#945;&#8208;Aryl esters represent an important family of nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. This novel synergistic strategy expands the scope of Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

      <dc:description>
Hierarchical hollow CoP and carbon composites were obtained through a facile one&#8208;step synthesis. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of conductive carbon layer and hierarchical hollow structure, the as&#8208;prepared CoP@C composites demonstrate superior sodium and potassium storage capability as anode materials for rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Hierarchical hollow CoP and carbon composites were obtained through a facile synthetic method, where carbonization and phosphorization of the precursor were completed within one single step. The composites are composed of hollow CoP@C spheres, which are further made up of CoP nanoparticles with a thin outer carbon layer. Electrochemical performances of the prepared CoP@C composites as anodes for sodium and potassium storage were evaluated and compared. In&#8197;situ TEM, in&#8197;situ synchrotron XRD, and DFT calculations were conducted to study the structural evolution and the interaction between Na/K and CoP during cycling processes. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of conductive carbon layer and hierarchical hollow structure, the as&#8208;prepared CoP@C composites demonstrate superior sodium and potassium storage capability as anode materials for rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Tuning Cellular Biological Functions Through the Controlled Release of NO from a Porous Ti&#8208;MOF</title>
      <dc:description>
NO limit: The delivery of nitric oxide with a new titanium metal&#8211;organic framework allows the control of biological functions of cells, due to its adsorption/release mechanism based on the formation of nitrites bound to the titanium sites. The high storage capacity, biocompatibility and slow release and stability in biological media, render this material an exceptional vehicle for nitric oxide delivery.







Abstract
Materials for the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO) are of interest for therapeutic applications. However, to date, many suffer from toxicity and stability issues, as well as poor performance. Herein, we propose a new NO adsorption/release mechanism through the formation of nitrites on the skeleton of a titanium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that we named MIP&#8208;177, featuring a suitable set of properties for such an application: (i) high NO storage capacity (3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mg&#8722;1solid), (ii) excellent biocompatibility at therapeutic relevant concentrations (no cytotoxicity at 90&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for wound healing) due to its high stability in biological media (&lt;9&#8201;% degradation in 72&#8197;hours) and (iii) slow NO release in biological media (&#8776;2&#8197;hours for 90&#8201;% release). The prospective application of MIP&#8208;177 is demonstrated through NO&#8208;driven control of mitochondrial respiration in cells and stimulation of cell migration, paving the way for the design of new NO delivery systems for wound healing therapy.

      <title>Molecular Porous Photosystems Tailored for Long&#8208;Term Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers were used as photosystems to deliver a constant production rate for the CO2 to formate reduction for several days. Their photoactivation pathway is presented, including an ultrafast electronic energy transfer from the photosensitizer to the catalyst as evidenced by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations.







Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level structuration of two full photosystems into conjugated porous organic polymers is reported. The strategy of heterogenization gives rise to photosystems which are still fully active after 4&#8197;days of continuous illumination. Those materials catalyze the carbon dioxide photoreduction driven by visible light to produce up to three grams of formate per gram of catalyst. The covalent tethering of the two active sites into a single framework is shown to play a key role in the visible light activation of the catalyst. The unprecedented long&#8208;term efficiency arises from an optimal photoinduced electron transfer from the light harvesting moiety to the catalytic site as anticipated by quantum mechanical calculations and evidenced by in situ ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy.

      <title>Tunable Periodically Ordered Mesoporosity in Palladium Membranes Enables Exceptional Enhancement of Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity for Formic Acid Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Formic and function: A palladium catalyst with periodically ordered mesoporosity is realized by asymmetrically replicating the bicontinuous cubic phase of a lyotropic liquid crystal. In formic acid oxidation electrocatalysis the optimized catalyst delivering 7.8&#8197;times the catalytic current of commercial Pd/C.







Abstract
Developing superior electrocatalysts for formic acid oxidation (FAO) is the most crucial step in commercializing direct formic acid fuel cells. Herein, we electrodeposited palladium membranes with periodically ordered mesoporosity obtained by asymmetrically replicating the bicontinuous cubic phase structure of a lyotropic liquid&#8208;crystal template. The Pd membrane with the largest periodicity and highest degree of order delivered up to 90.5&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of electrochemical active surface area and 3.34&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 electrocatalysis capability towards FAO, 3.8 and 7.8 times the values of the commercial Pd/C catalyst, respectively. By controlling the temperature and potential of the electrodeposition procedure, the periodicity area and order degree of the mesoporosity are highly tunable. These Pd membranes gave prototype formic acid fueled cells with 4.3 and 2.4 times the maximum current and power density of the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Native S&#8208;Palmitoylated Membrane Proteins through Removable&#8208;Backbone&#8208;Modification&#8208;Assisted Ser/Thr Ligation</title>
      <dc:description>
Native proteins by non&#8208;native methods: An RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL strategy (removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted serine/threonine ligation) was developed for the chemical synthesis of native S&#8208;palmitoylated membrane proteins, which have not previously been accessible through chemical synthesis. The successful synthesis of S&#8208;palmitoylated sarcolipin and M2 demonstrates the importance of non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.







Abstract
The preparation of native S&#8208;palmitoylated (S&#8208;palm) membrane proteins is one of the unsolved challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, we report the first chemical synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins by removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted Ser/Thr ligation (RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL). This method involves two critical steps: 1)&#8197;synthesis of S&#8208;palm peptides by a new &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid based RBM (RBMGABA) strategy, and 2)&#8197;ligation of the S&#8208;palm RBM&#8208;modified peptides to give the desired S&#8208;palm product by the STL method. The utility of the RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL method was demonstrated by the synthesis of rabbit S&#8208;palm sarcolipin (SLN) and S&#8208;palm matrix&#8208;2 (M2) ion channel. The synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins highlights the importance of developing non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.

      <title>Magnifying the Structural Components of Biomembranes: A Prototype for the Study of the Self&#8208;Assembly of Giant Lipids</title>
      <dc:description>
The bigger the better: Two categories of giant, lipid&#8208;like amphiphilic molecules organize into various mesostructures, shedding new light on the underlying principles of lipid self&#8208;assembly. The geometric parameters of these giant, lipid&#8208;like molecules are modulated on a molecular level to understand the physiochemical driving forces behind their self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
How biomembranes are self&#8208;organized to perform their functions remains a pivotal issue in biological and chemical science. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly principles of lipid&#8208;like molecules hence becomes crucial. Herein, we report the mesostructural evolution of amphiphilic sphere&#8208;rod conjugates (giant lipids), and study the roles of geometric parameters (head&#8211;tail ratio and cross&#8208;sectional area) during this course. As a prototype system, giant lipids resemble natural lipidic molecules by capturing their essential features. The self&#8208;assembly behavior of two categories of giant lipids (I&#8208;shape and T&#8208;shape, a total of 8 molecules) is demonstrated. A rich variety of mesostructures is constructed in solution state and their molecular packing models are rationally understood. Giant lipids recast the phase behavior of natural lipids to a certain degree and the abundant self&#8208;assembled morphologies reveal distinct physiochemical behaviors when geometric parameters deviate from natural analogues.

      <title>Multivariate Modulation of the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 for Defect&#8208;Controlled Combination Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Multivariate modulation: Inclusion of multiple modulators into one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of MOFs yields UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles with three drugs loaded at defect sites throughout the structure, yet still sufficient porosity to postsynthetically store a fourth, selectivity&#8208;enhancing, anticancer drug.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as leading candidates for nanoscale drug delivery, as a consequence of their high drug capacities, ease of functionality, and the ability to carefully engineer key physical properties. Despite many anticancer treatment regimens consisting of a cocktail of different drugs, examples of delivery of multiple drugs from one MOF are rare, potentially hampered by difficulties in postsynthetic loading of more than one cargo molecule. Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination to the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.

Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination to the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Light&#8208;Controllable Ionic Conductivity in a Polymeric Ionic Liquid</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive PILs: Polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) materials based on diarylethene units have been designed to undergo a light&#8208;mediated change in conductivity. Key to this modulation is a change in the cationic character of the imidazolium bridging unit upon photoswitching. Irradiation with UV light triggers a 70&#8201;% drop in conductivity in the solid state, which can be recovered upon subsequent irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) have attracted considerable attention as electrolytes with high stability and mechanical durability. Light&#8208;responsive materials are enabling for a variety of future technologies owing to their remote and noninvasive manipulation, spatiotemporal control, and low environmental impact. To address this potential, responsive PIL materials based on diarylethene units were designed to undergo light&#8208;mediated conductivity changes. Key to this modulation is tuning of the cationic character of the imidazolium bridging unit upon photoswitching. Irradiation of these materials with UV light triggers a circa 70&#8201;% drop in conductivity in the solid state that can be recovered upon subsequent irradiation with visible light. This light&#8208;responsive ionic conductivity enables spatiotemporal and reversible patterning of PIL films using light. This modulation of ionic conductivity allows for the development of light&#8208;controlled electrical circuits and wearable photodetectors.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Assisted Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroarylation of Allenoates</title>
      <dc:description>
Leading light: A regio&#8208; and stereoselective fluoroarylation of allenic esters through visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted gold redox catalysis with cost&#8208;effective Et3N&#8901;3&#8201;HF as the nucleophilic fluorine source is reported. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal concomitant activation of the allene motif by a high&#8208;valent gold complex and the hydrogen fluoride by hydrogen bonding with the ester group, thereby enabling the otherwise challenging fluorine incorporation.







Abstract
A strategically novel synthetic method for the fluoroarylation of allenic ester was developed that enables the expedient construction of a host of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing cinnamate derivatives. The reaction proceeds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted gold redox catalysis, occurs smoothly under very mild reaction conditions, accommodates a large variety of functional groups, and more importantly allows the incorporation of fluorine and aryl groups with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The concomitant activation mode for both the allene motif and the hydrogen fluoride is key for the success of the reaction.

      <title>Excited&#8208;State Aromaticity of Gold(III) Hexaphyrins and Metalation Effect Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
The aromaticity reversal in the excited&#8208;state of gold&#8208;coordinated hexaphyrins is revealed by vibrational and electronic structure analyses. The structural changes driven by the aromaticity reversal, and the corresponding inverted electronic structures, were also detected.







Abstract
Expanded porphyrins with appropriate metalation provide an excellent opportunity to study excited&#8208;state aromaticity. The coordinated metal allows the excited&#8208;state aromaticity in the triplet state to be detected through the heavy&#8208;atom effect, but other metalation effects on the excited&#8208;state aromaticity were ambiguous. Herein, the excited&#8208;state aromaticity of gold(III) hexaphyrins through the relaxation dynamics was revealed via electronic and vibrational spectroscopy. The SQ states of gold [26]&#8208; and [28]&#8208;hexaphyrins showed interconvertible absorption and IR spectra with those of counterparts in the ground&#8208;state, indicating aromaticity reversal. Furthermore, while the T1 states of gold [28]&#8208;hexaphyrins also exhibited reversed aromaticity according to Baird's rule, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer state of gold [26]&#8208;hexaphyrins contributed by the gold metal showed non&#8208;aromatic features arising from the odd&#8208;number of &#960;&#8208;electrons.

      <title>Arsenene: A Potential Therapeutic Agent for Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Cells by Acting on Nuclear Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Course of action: Arsenene nanosheets have been shown to have potent antiproliferative activity against a variety of cancer cells, especially NB4 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells, while showing no toxicity towards normal cells. A mechanistic study in NB4 cells revealed that arsenene induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potentials, thereby leading to apoptosis of the cells.







Abstract
Arsenene has recently emerged as a promising new two&#8208;dimensional material for biomedical applications because of its excellent optical and electronic properties. Herein, novel 2D arsenene nanosheets were synthesized and shown to be effective against NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells (82&#8201;% inhibition) as well as inducing apoptosis while showing no toxicity towards normal cells. The high zeta potential, small size, and the planar structure were crucial to the toxicity of the materials. Label&#8208;free proteomic profiling analysis suggested that arsenene affected nuclear DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and pyrimidine metabolism pathways by downregulating the DNA polymerases POLE, POLD1, POLD2, and POLD3. Mass spectrometric studies showed that arsenene bound mainly to nuclear nucleotide acid binding proteins in NB4 cells and further cellular fluorescence studies revealed that the arsenene destroyed the nuclei. In&#8197;vivo toxicity tests in mice also indicated the physiological biosafety of arsenene.

      <title>Anti&#8208;Aromatic versus Induced Paratropicity: Synthesis and Interrogation of a Dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene with a Proton Placed Directly above the Central Ring</title>
      <dc:description>
An oxidative coupling within a diazadioxa[10]helicene gives a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene, with a proton from a pendant naphthalene moiety centred directly above the central nine&#8208;membered ring. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis revealed that this distinct environment induces a significant magnetic deshielding effect on that particular proton.







Abstract
We present a high&#8208;yielding intramolecular oxidative coupling within a diazadioxa[10]helicene to give a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene. This is the first [n]circulene containing more than eight ortho&#8208;annulated rings (n&gt;8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals a tight columnar packing, with a proton from a pendant naphthalene moiety centred directly above the central nine&#8208;membered ring. This distinct environment induces a significant magnetic deshielding effect on that particular proton as determined by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The origin of the deshielding effect was investigated computationally in terms of the NICS values. It is established that the deshielding effect originates from an induced paratropic ring current from the seven aromatic rings of the [9]circulene structure, and is not due to the nine&#8208;membered ring being antiaromatic. UV/Vis spectroscopy reveals more efficient conjugation in the prepared diazatrioxa[9]circulene compared to the parent helical azaoxa[10]helicenes, and DFT calculations, including energy levels, confirm the experimental observations.

UV/Vis spectroscopy reveals more efficient conjugation in the prepared diazatrioxa[9]circulene compared to the parent helical azaoxa[10]helicenes, and DFT calculations, including energy levels, confirm the experimental observations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Harvesting from Arid Air with Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Modified by Hygroscopic Salt</title>
      <dc:description>
A composite sorbent for efficient water harvesting from dry air is prepared by confining a hygroscopic salt in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix (LiCl@MIL&#8208;101(Cr)). This composite sorbent works efficiently under outdoor ambient conditions powered by natural sunlight without additional energy input.







Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge threatening human survival, especially for people living in arid regions. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is an appealing way to solve this problem. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AWH technologies have poor water harvesting performance in arid climates owing to the low water sorption capacity of common sorbents under low humidity conditions. We report a high&#8208;performance composite sorbent for efficient water harvesting from arid air by confining hygroscopic salt in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix (LiCl@MIL&#8208;101(Cr)). The composite sorbent shows 0.77&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water sorption capacity at 1.2&#8197;kPa vapor pressure (30&#8201;% relative humidity at 30&#8201;&#176;C) by integrating the multi&#8208;step sorption processes of salt chemisorption, deliquescence, and solution absorption. A highly efficient AWH prototype is demonstrated with LiCl@MIL&#8208;101(Cr) that can enable the harvesting of 0.45&#8211;0.7&#8197;kg water per kilogram of material under laboratory and outdoor ambient conditions powered by natural sunlight without optical concentration and additional energy input.

      <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst as an Efficient Multiple Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Scavenger for Sepsis Management</title>
      <dc:description>
Better than nanozymes: By mimicking triple antioxidant enzymes, conducting an oxidative&#8208;reduction cycle, and formation of a nitrosyl&#8211;metal complex, an enzyme&#8208;mimicking single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAzyme) can quickly obliterate multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels to alleviate sepsis.







Abstract
Sepsis, characterized by immoderate production of multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), causes high morbidity and mortality. Despite progress made with nanozymes, efficient antioxidant therapy to eliminate these RONS remains challenging, owing largely to the specificity and low activity of exploited nanozymes. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;mimicking single&#8208;atom catalyst, Co/PMCS, features atomically dispersed coordinatively unsaturated active Co&#8208;porphyrin centers, which can rapidly obliterate multiple RONS to alleviate sepsis. Co/PMCS can eliminate O2.&#8722; and H2O2 by mimicking superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, while removing .OH via the oxidative&#8208;reduction cycle, with markedly higher activity than nanozymes. It can also scavenge .NO through formation of a nitrosyl&#8211;metal complex. Eventually, it can reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, protect organs from damage, and confer a distinct survival advantage to the infected sepsis mice.

      <title>Multicomponent Peptide Stapling as a Diversity&#8208;Driven Tool for the Development of Inhibitors of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
An effective strategy for the development of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides through Ugi stapling is described. Highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53 is shown based on three biorthogonal assays, for example, fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis, and 2D NMR. Additionally, several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained.







Abstract
Stapled peptides are chemical entities in&#8208;between biologics and small molecules, which have proven to be the solution to high affinity protein&#8211;protein interaction antagonism, while keeping control over pharmacological performance such as stability and membrane penetration. We demonstrate that the multicomponent reaction&#8208;based stapling is an effective strategy for the development of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides with highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53. Such a potent inhibitory activity of p53&#8208;MDM2/X interactions was assessed by fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis, and 2D NMR, while several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained. This MCR stapling protocol proved efficient and versatile in terms of diversity generation at the staple, as evidenced by the incorporation of both exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;cyclic hydrophobic moieties at the side chain cross&#8208;linkers. The interaction of the Ugi&#8208;staple fragments with the target protein was demonstrated by crystallography.

      <title>Designing a 0D/2D S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction over Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Inactivation of Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
A 0D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material involving CeO2 quantum dots and polymeric carbon nitride (CeO2/PCN) was designed and constructed. This heterojunction material has a high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1&#8201;%) towards Staphylococcus aureus under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Constructing heterojunctions between two semiconductors with matched band structure is an effective strategy to acquire high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction system has shown great potential in facilitating separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, as well as acquiring strong photoredox ability. Herein, a 0D/2D S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction material involving CeO2 quantum dots and polymeric carbon nitride (CeO2/PCN) is designed and constructed by in&#8197;situ wet chemistry with subsequent heat treatment. This S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material shows high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1&#8201;%) towards Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm), which is 2.7 and 8.2 times that of pure CeO2 (32.2&#8201;%) and PCN (10.7&#8201;%), respectively. Strong evidence of S&#8208;scheme charge transfer path is verified by theoretical calculations, in&#8197;situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance.

      <title>Unprecedented Sequence Control and Sequence&#8208;Driven Properties in a Series of AB&#8208;Alternating Copolymers Consisting Solely of Acrylamide Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units have been produced. Crucial to realizing this unprecedented polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer carrying two activated ester bonds to allow &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization and aminolysis. Some of the alternating copolyacrylamides exhibit unique properties compared to the random copolymers in solution and in the bulk state.







Abstract
Herein, we report a method to synthesize a series of alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units. Crucial to realizing this polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer that contains acrylate and acrylamide moieties connected by two activated ester bonds. This design, which is based on the reactivity ratio of the embedded vinyl groups, allows a &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization, wherein the intramolecular and intermolecular propagation are repeated alternately under dilute conditions. The addition of an amine to the resulting cyclopolymers afforded two different acryl amide units, i.e., an amine&#8208;substituted acryl amide and a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ethyl&#8208;substituted acryl amide in alternating sequence. Using this method, we could furnish ten types of alternating copolymers; some of these exhibit unique properties in solution and in the bulk, which are different from those of the corresponding random copolymers, and we attributed the differences to the alternating sequence.

Crucial to realizing this unprecedented polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer carrying two activated ester bonds to allow &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization and aminolysis. Some of the alternating copolyacrylamides exhibit unique properties compared to the random copolymers in solution and in the bulk state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a method to synthesize a series of alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units. Crucial to realizing this polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer that contains acrylate and acrylamide moieties connected by two activated ester bonds. This design, which is based on the reactivity ratio of the embedded vinyl groups, allows a &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization, wherein the intramolecular and intermolecular propagation are repeated alternately under dilute conditions. The addition of an amine to the resulting cyclopolymers afforded two different acryl amide units, i.e., an amine&#8208;substituted acryl amide and a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ethyl&#8208;substituted acryl amide in alternating sequence. Using this method, we could furnish ten types of alternating copolymers; some of these exhibit unique properties in solution and in the bulk, which are different from those of the corresponding random copolymers, and we attributed the differences to the alternating sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amide Synthesis by Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Carbamoylation of (Hetero)Aryl Bromides</title>
      <dc:description>
Teaming up for amide synthesis: A catalytic method for amide synthesis is detailed that proceeds at ambient temperature and enables the direct carbamoylation of (hetero)aryl bromides. This method is based on the combination of nickel and photoredox catalysis and uses readily available dihydropyridines as precursors of carbamoyl radicals.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;electron strategy for catalytic amide synthesis that enables the direct carbamoylation of (hetero)aryl bromides. This radical cross&#8208;coupling approach, which is based on the combination of nickel and photoredox catalysis, proceeds at ambient temperature and uses readily available dihydropyridines as precursors of carbamoyl radicals. The method's mild reaction conditions make it tolerant of sensitive&#8208;functional&#8208;group&#8208;containing substrates and allow the installation of an amide scaffold within biologically relevant heterocycles. In addition, we installed amide functionalities bearing electron&#8208;poor and sterically hindered amine moieties, which would be difficult to prepare with classical dehydrative condensation methods.

      <title>Living Supramolecular Polymerization of an Aza&#8208;BODIPY Dye Controlled by a Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Accepting Triazole Unit Introduced by Click Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
aza&#8208;BODIPY comes alive! Living supramolecular polymerization was demonstrated by aza&#8208;BODIPY 1 bearing hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting triazole units that can be facilely constructed through click chemistry. The H&#8208;bonding unit of amide&#8208;linked triazole in dye 1 could be employed as a general motif for encoding conformational information and developing polymorphic supramolecular systems.







Abstract
An aza&#8208;BODIPY dye 1 bearing two hydrophobic fan&#8208;shaped tridodecyloxybenzamide pendants through 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linkages was synthesized by a click reaction and characterized. 1H&#8197;NMR studies indicated that dye 1 exhibited variable conformations through intramolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction, which is beneficial for the polymorphism of aggregation. The thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic aspect of the supramolecular polymerization of dye 1 was investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, AFM, TEM, and SEM. Biphasic aggregation pathways of dye 1, leads to the formation of off&#8208;pathway, metastable Agg.&#8197;I and thermodynamically stable Agg.&#8197;II with distinct H&#8208;aggregation spectra and nanoscale morphology. The living manner of the supramolecular polymerization of dye 1 was demonstrated in seeded polymerization experiments with temperature&#8208;modulated successive cooling&#8211;heating cycles.

      <title>Acid Exfoliation of Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Solution Processing into Crystalline Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Film star: Covalent organic frameworks are promising candidates for applications such as charge&#8208;storage devices, nanofiltration membranes, and optoelectronic devices.

Acid exfoliation enables the scalable conversion of imine&#8208;linked COF powders into the more desirable thin&#8208;film morphology.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly modular porous crystalline polymers that are of interest for applications such as charge&#8208;storage devices, nanofiltration membranes, and optoelectronic devices. COFs are typically synthesized as microcrystalline powders, which limits their performance in these applications, and their limited solubility precludes large&#8208;scale processing into more useful morphologies and devices. We report a general, scalable method to exfoliate two&#8208;dimensional imine&#8208;linked COF powders by temporarily protonating their linkages. The resulting suspensions were cast into continuous crystalline COF films up to 10&#8197;cm in diameter, with thicknesses ranging from 50&#8197;nm to 20&#8197;&#956;m depending on the suspension composition, concentration, and casting protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the film fabrication process proceeds through a partial depolymerization/repolymerization mechanism, providing mechanically robust films that can be easily separated from their substrates.

Abstract
X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an indispensable technique in modern materials science for the determination of chemical bonding as evidenced by more than 10&#8201;000 XPS papers published annually. A literature survey reveals that in the vast majority of cases an incorrect referencing of the binding energy scale is used, neglecting warnings that have been formulated from the early days of the technique. Consequences for the data reliability are disastrous and decades of XPS work require revisiting. The purpose of this Viewpoint is to highlight the existing problems, review the criticism and suggest ways forward.

      <dc:description>
The selective N&#8208;acylation of glucosamine with unprotected carboxylic acids enables the biosynthesis of unnatural glycosides and their subsequent enzymatic modification. In their Communication on page&#8197;5308, L. Liu, S.&#8197;L. Flitsch, J. Voglmeir et&#8197;al. report that the enzyme chitobiose deacetylase from Cyclobacterium marinum has promiscuous N&#8208;acylation activity without the need for activation of the acid. This selective N&#8208;acylation step provides the last missing link for the fully enzymatic multistep synthesis of C5&#8208;modified sialosides from chitin.

      <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between discrete co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide (NDI) units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI were modulated by changes in temperature and solvent polarity. As M. Takeuchi et&#8197;al. report in their Communication page&#8197;5254, the tuning of through&#8208;space electronic communication through the conformational transformation between monomer&#8208; and dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI resulted in a highly sensitive and reversible optical response over a wide range of temperatures.

      <dc:description>
Heterobifunctional rotaxanes serve as catalysts for the addition of malonates to Michael acceptors. In their Research Article on page&#8197;5102, J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al. report a series of heterobifunctional rotaxanes, featuring an amine&#8208;based thread and a chiral phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based macrocycle. Rational catalyst improvements aided by high&#8208;level DFT calculations led to interlocked catalysts that surpass their non&#8208;interlocked counterparts in terms of reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heterobifunctional rotaxanes&lt;/b&gt; serve as catalysts for the addition of malonates to Michael acceptors. In their Research Article on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201913781page&#8197;5102&lt;/a&gt;, J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al. report a series of heterobifunctional rotaxanes, featuring an amine&#8208;based thread and a chiral phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based macrocycle. Rational catalyst improvements aided by high&#8208;level DFT calculations led to interlocked catalysts that surpass their non&#8208;interlocked counterparts in terms of reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

      <title>Deracemization Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited deracemization: Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been utilized to convert racemates into single enantiomers in the presence of a chiral photosensitizer or a pair of chiral catalysts. Mechanistic studies revealed that energy transfer (EnT) or a sequence of electron transfer (ET), proton transfer (PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is operative.







Abstract
Deracemization is an ideal but challenging strategy for the conversion of a racemic mixture into a single enantiomer. Recent studies have demonstrated that visible&#8208;light photocatalysis could be utilized to promote selective deracemization of axially chiral allenes as well as cyclopropylquinolones and cyclic ureas with central chirality either through energy transfer or through a sequence of electron, proton, and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

      <title>Polymer Networks: From Plastics and Gels to Porous Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Polymer networks are materials composed of linear strands connected by multifunctional junctions. These strands and junctions can be flexible or rigid (macro)molecules, and the connections between strands and junctions can be covalent or non&#8208;covalent. Thus, polymer networks comprise a vast array of useful materials ranging from elastomers and gels to porous crystalline frameworks.







Abstract
Polymer networks, which are materials composed of many smaller components&#8212;referred to as &#8220;junctions&#8221; and &#8220;strands&#8221;&#8212;connected together via covalent or non&#8208;covalent/supramolecular interactions, are arguably the most versatile, widely studied, broadly used, and important materials known. From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that must be addressed to enable a complete understanding of these materials and facilitate their development for emerging applications ranging from sustainability and energy harvesting/storage to tissue engineering and additive manufacturing. Here, we provide a unifying overview of the fundamentals of polymer network synthesis, structure, and properties, tying together recent trends in the field that are not always associated with classical polymer networks, such as the advent of crystalline &#8220;framework&#8221; materials. We also highlight recent advances in using molecular design and control of topology to showcase how a deep understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships can lead to advanced networks with exceptional properties.

      <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Chemical Approaches to Designer Structures and Built&#8208;In Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
Up to the imagination: This Review shows the fundamentals for transforming covalent organic frameworks into designer structures in terms of both the skeletons and pores. The focus lies on functions based on interplays between photons, excitons, electrons, holes, ions, spins, and molecules, with structure&#8211;function correlations and framework&#8208;specific properties described.







Abstract
A new approach has been developed to design organic polymers using topology diagrams. This strategy enables covalent integration of organic units into ordered topologies and creates a new polymer form, that is, covalent organic frameworks. This is a breakthrough in chemistry because it sets a molecular platform for synthesizing polymers with predesignable primary and high&#8208;order structures, which has been a central aim for over a century but unattainable with traditional design principles. This new field has its own features that are distinct from conventional polymers. This Review summarizes the fundamentals as well as major progress by focusing on the chemistry used to design structures, including the principles, synthetic strategies, and control methods. We scrutinize built&#8208;in functions that are specific to the structures by revealing various interplays and mechanisms involved in the expression of function. We propose major fundamental issues to be addressed in chemistry as well as future directions from physics, materials, and application perspectives.

      <title>Rational Design of an Iron&#8208;Based Catalyst for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Couplings Involving Heteroaromatic Boronic Esters and Tertiary Alkyl Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
Nacnac! Who's there? A mechanistically driven approach to Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with a nacnac iron&#8208;based catalyst enables the facile construction of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds with heteroaromatic boronic esters. Additional advancements allow for the construction of all carbon quaternary centers with no observable isomerization.







Abstract
Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions between a variety of alkyl halides and unactivated aryl boronic esters using a rationally designed iron&#8208;based catalyst supported by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands are described. High catalyst activity resulted in a broad substrate scope that included tertiary alkyl halides and heteroaromatic boronic esters. Mechanistic experiments revealed that the iron&#8208;based catalyst benefited from the propensity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands to support low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing iron amide intermediates, which are very efficient for effecting the transmetalation step required for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Direct Aldol Addition of Aryl Ketones to &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated chiral tertiary alcohols from (hetero)aryl methyl ketones is described. A novel bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst facilitates direct aldol addition up to 1400 times faster than the previous state of the art.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated chiral tertiary alcohols from (hetero)aryl methyl ketones is described.

      <title>Modulation of Prins Cyclization by Vibrational Strong Coupling
</title>
      <dc:description>
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) of a series of aldehyde and ketone reactants in the Prins cyclization is investigated. The second&#8208;order rate constant is decreased by VSC of the carbonyl stretching band. The extension of VSC chemistry to common cycloadditions further establishes a link between quantum electrodynamics and synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
Light&#8208;molecule strong coupling has emerged within the last decade as a new method to control chemical reactions. A few years ago it was discovered that chemical reactivity could be altered by vibrational strong coupling (VSC). Only a limited number of reactions have been investigated under VSC to date, including solvolysis and deprotection reactions. Here the effect of VSC on a series of aldehydes and ketones undergoing Prins cyclization, an important synthetic step in pharmaceutical chemistry, is investigated. A decrease of the second&#8208;order rate constant with VSC of the reactant carbonyl stretching groups is observed. We also observe an increased activation energy due to VSC, but proportional changes in activation enthalpy and entropy, suggesting no substantive change in reaction pathway. The addition of common cycloaddition reactions to the stable of VSC&#8208;modified chemical reactions is another step towards establishing VSC as a genuine tool for synthetic chemistry.

      <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;PF&#8208;1018</title>

Abstract
The combination of electrocyclizations and cycloadditions accounts for the formation of a range of fascinating natural products. Cascades consisting of 8&#960; electrocyclizations followed by a 6&#960; electrocyclization and a cycloaddition are relatively common. We now report the synthesis of the tetramic acid PF&#8208;1018 through an 8&#960; electrocyclization, the product of which is immediately intercepted by a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition. The success of this pericyclic cascade was critically dependent on the substitution pattern of the starting polyene and could be rationalized through DFT calculations. The completion of the synthesis required the instalment of a trisubstituted double bond by radical deoxygenation. An unexpected side product formed through 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization could be recycled through an unprecedented triflation/fragmentation.

      <title>Specific Binding of a d&#8208;RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure with an l&#8208;RNA Aptamer</title>
      <dc:description>
Opposites attract: An l&#8208;RNA aptamer produced by in&#8197;vitro selection binds strongly and specifically to the TERRA d&#8208;RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4). Notably, it can distinguish TERRA rG4 from other rG4s and nucleic&#8208;acid structures, and is capable of inhibiting TERRA&#8208;rG4&#8211;peptide interactions.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures are of general importance in chemistry and biology, such as in biosensing, gene regulation, and cancers. Although a large repertoire of G4&#8208;binding tools has been developed, no aptamer has been developed to interact with G4. Moreover, the G4 selectivity of current toolkits is very limited. Herein, we report the first l&#8208;RNA aptamer that targets a d&#8208;RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4). Using TERRA rG4 as an example, our results reveal that this l&#8208;RNA aptamer, Ap3&#8208;7, folds into a unique secondary structure, exhibits high G4 selectivity and effectively interferes with TERRA&#8208;rG4&#8211;RHAU53 binding. Our approach and findings open a new door in further developing G4&#8208;specific tools for diverse applications.

      <title>Phosphonium Boranes for the Selective Transport of Fluoride Anions across Artificial Phospholipid Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Quick as a F&#8722;lash: The use of Lewis acidic, water&#8208;compatible phosphonium boranes is introduced for the quick and selective transport of F&#8722; across biological membrane mimics.







Abstract
With the view of developing selective transmembrane anion transporters, a series of phosphonium boranes of general formula [p&#8208;RPh2P(C6H4)BMes2]+ have been synthesized and evaluated. The results demonstrate that variation of the R group appended to the phosphorus atom informs the lipophilicity of these compounds, their Lewis acidity, as well as their transport activity. Anion transport experiments in POPC&#8208;based large unilamellar vesicles show that these main&#8208;group cations are highly selective for the fluoride anion, which is transported more than 20 times faster than the chloride anion. Finally, this work shows that the anion transport properties of these compounds are extremely sensitive to the steric crowding about the boron atom, pointing to the crucial involvement of the Group&#8197;13 element as the anion binding site.

      <title>Toughening a Self&#8208;Healable Supramolecular Polymer by Ionic Cluster&#8208;Enhanced Iron&#8208;Carboxylate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;density iron&#8208;carboxylate ionic clusters can remarkably toughen a dry supramolecular network by forming high&#8208;affinity secondary ionic clusters. The toughened network exhibits high mechanical strength, high stretchability, efficient self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers that can heal themselves automatically usually exhibit weakness in mechanical toughness and stretchability. Here we exploit a toughening strategy for a dynamic dry supramolecular network by introducing ionic cluster&#8208;enhanced iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes. The resulting dry supramolecular network simultaneous exhibits tough mechanical strength, high stretchability, self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature. The excellent performance of these distinct supramolecular polymers is attributed to the hierarchical existence of four types of dynamic combinations in the high&#8208;density dry network, including dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, noncovalent H&#8208;bonds, iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes and ionic clustering interactions. The extremely facile preparation method of this self&#8208;healing polymer offers prospects for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost material among others for coatings and wearable devices.

Here we exploit a toughening strategy for a dynamic dry supramolecular network by introducing ionic cluster&#8208;enhanced iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes. The resulting dry supramolecular network simultaneous exhibits tough mechanical strength, high stretchability, self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature. The excellent performance of these distinct supramolecular polymers is attributed to the hierarchical existence of four types of dynamic combinations in the high&#8208;density dry network, including dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, noncovalent H&#8208;bonds, iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes and ionic clustering interactions. The extremely facile preparation method of this self&#8208;healing polymer offers prospects for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost material among others for coatings and wearable devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Probing Long&#8208;Range Anisotropic Interactions: a General and Sign&#8208;Sensitive Strategy to Measure 1H&#8211;1H Residual Dipolar Couplings as a Key Advance for Organic Structure Determination</title>
      <dc:description>
Access granted: NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) between nuclei are powerful reporters of the molecular structure, and RDCs between protons would be a key addition to many structure&#8208;elucidation problems. However, the overload of 1H&#8211;1H RDC interactions make both their magnitudes and signs unresolvable. Here, new experiments are introduced that make access to 1H&#8211;1H RDCs straightforward.







Abstract
Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are amongst the most powerful NMR parameters for organic structure elucidation. In order to maximize their effectiveness in increasingly complex cases such as flexible compounds, a maximum of RDCs between nuclei sampling a large distribution of orientations is needed, including sign information. For this, the easily accessible one&#8208;bond 1H&#8211;13C RDCs alone often fall short. Long&#8208;range 1H&#8211;1H RDCs are both abundant and typically sample highly complementary orientations, but accessing them in a sign&#8208;sensitive way has been severely obstructed due to the overflow of 1H&#8211;1H couplings. Here, we present a generally applicable strategy that allows the measurement of a large number of 1H&#8211;1H RDCs, including their signs, which is based on a combination of an improved PSYCHEDELIC method and a new selective constant&#8208;time &#946;&#8208;COSY experiment. The potential of 1H&#8211;1H RDCs to better determine molecular alignment and to discriminate between enantiomers and diastereomers is demonstrated.

      <title>NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Defluorinative Olefin Cross&#8208;Coupling: Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Alkenes as Acceptor Olefins to Form gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Walk the line: gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes are obtained through defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling between a donor olefin and trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted acceptor olefin. This migratory coupling is air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant, has a broad substrate scope, and proceeds with both site&#8208; and chemoselectivity under mild conditions. Chain&#8208;walking occurs only along the hydrocarbon chain of the donor olefin with no dissociation of NiH.







Abstract
We report a NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory defluorinative coupling between two electronically differentiated olefins. A broad range of unactivated donor olefins can be joined directly to acceptor olefins containing an electron&#8208;deficient trifluoromethyl substituent in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion to form gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This migratory coupling shows both site&#8208; and chemoselectivity under mild conditions, with the formation of a tertiary or quaternary carbon center.

      <title>Photoresponsive Propeller&#8208;like Chiral AIE Copper(I) Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
All in a spin: A pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear CuI clusters with typical aggregation induced emission (AIE) features were developed. They exhibit exceptional photoinduced fluorescence enhancement.







Abstract
A pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear CuI clusters (R/S&#8208;Cu3) with unique photoinduced fluorescence enhancement were prepared. R/S&#8208;Cu3 showed intense variable luminescence after UV light irradiation, which was attributed to the stepwise oxidation of ligand in the clusters. It exhibited typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) (&#945;AIE=17.3). Mechanism studies showed that metal cluster&#8208;centered (MCC) and triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) processes are the origin of the luminescence; the processes are regulated by a restriction of intramolecular motions mechanism in a different state. The chiral structure and AIE feature endow R/S&#8208;Cu3 with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence (glum=2&#215;10&#8722;2) in the aggregated state. It shows good capability for producing reactive oxygen species. This work enriches the kinds of atomically precise AIE clusters, gains insight into their luminescence mechanism, and offers the prospect of application in multifunctional materials.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for the Exploitation of Distance between Active Sites in Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
MOF Jenga: A series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) were used to overcome the limit of distance between active sites in bio&#8208;systems and to unveil the critical role of this distance for efficient catalysis. A linear correlation was established between photocatalytic activity and the reciprocal of inter active&#8208;site distance; a smaller distance led to higher activity.







Abstract
Discoveries of the accurate spatial arrangement of active sites in biological systems and cooperation between them for high catalytic efficiency are two major events in biology. However, precise tuning of these aspects is largely missing in the design of artificial catalysts. Here, a series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) were used, not only to overcome the limit of distance between active sites in bio&#8208;systems, but also to unveil the critical role of this distance for efficient catalysis. A linear correlation was established between photocatalytic activity and the reciprocal of inter active&#8208;site distance; a smaller distance led to higher activity. Vacancies created at selected crystallographic positions of MOFs promoted their photocatalytic efficiency. MOF&#8208;525&#8208;J33 with 15.6&#8197;&#197; inter active&#8208;site distance and 33&#8201;% vacancies exhibited unprecedented high turnover frequency of 29.5&#8197;h&#8722;1 in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acceptorless dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinoline at room temperature.

      <title>NHC/Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Unactivated Olefins and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;dimerization reactivity dominates over hydroalkenylation of methylenecyclopropanes (1) and alkenes (2) when using a new [NHC&#8208;NiII(allyl)]BArF catalyst under mild reaction conditions. Functionalized methylene cyclopentanes (3) were obtained as products in high yields and chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. The reaction scope and reactivity were complementary to the traditional Ni0/Pd0 systems. This discovery presents a new strategy for mild C&#8722;C activation of 1 and 1&#8242;. NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;dimerization of a methylenecyclopropane (1) and an unactivated alkene (2) with typical hydroalkenylation reactivity was observed for the first time by using a [NHC&#8208;Ni(allyl)]BArF catalyst (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Results show that the C&#8722;C cleavage of 1 did not involve a Ni0 oxidative addition, which was crucial in former systems. Thus the method reported here emerges as a complementary method for attaining highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of methylenecyclopentanes (3) with broad scope. An efficient NHC/NiII&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of 1 leads to the convergent synthesis of 3 in the presence of 2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cross&#8208;dimerization&lt;/b&gt; reactivity dominates over hydroalkenylation of methylenecyclopropanes (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and alkenes (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) when using a new [NHC&#8208;Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(allyl)]BAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst under mild reaction conditions. Functionalized methylene cyclopentanes (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) were obtained as products in high yields and chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. The reaction scope and reactivity were complementary to the traditional Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; systems. This discovery presents a new strategy for mild C&#8722;C activation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;. NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross&#8208;dimerization of a methylenecyclopropane (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and an unactivated alkene (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) with typical hydroalkenylation reactivity was observed for the first time by using a [NHC&#8208;Ni(allyl)]BAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Results show that the C&#8722;C cleavage of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; did not involve a Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; oxidative addition, which was crucial in former systems. Thus the method reported here emerges as a complementary method for attaining highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of methylenecyclopentanes (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) with broad scope. An efficient NHC/Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; leads to the convergent synthesis of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highly Selective Separation of Minimum&#8208;Boiling Azeotrope Toluene/Pyridine by Nonporous Adaptive Crystals of Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep &#8217;em separated: A simple and energy&#8208;efficient separation method, using nonporous adaptive crystals of cucurbit[6]uril, for toluene/pyridine mixtures is reported. The method has a high selectivity for pyridine and can remove even a small quantity of pyridine in the crude toluene stream.







Abstract
The production of high purity toluene and pyridine is of significance in both industrial production and synthetic chemistry. The present protocols available to separate toluene/pyridine mixtures are several energy&#8208;intensive distillation methods, which are not environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective. Herein, we provide an energy&#8208;efficient and simple adsorptive separation protocol using nonporous adaptive crystals of cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6]). Q[6] crystals separate pyridine from toluene/pyridine mixtures with nearly 100&#8201;% purity. Furthermore, removal of the guest from guest&#8208;loaded Q[6] leads to the guest&#8208;free cucurbit[6]uril, which can be recycled without losing performance.

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis of Aromatic &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters for in Situ Production of Transient and Persistent Radicals for Organic Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;in&#8208;one: A photocatalyst mediates the generation of a transient &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical and a persistent ketyl radical from aromatic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters in&#8197;situ, which enables straightforward synthesis of pinacols and highly substituted 1&#8208;naphthols in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner under mild conditions.







Abstract
Radical formation is the initial step for conventional radical chemistry. Reported herein is a unified strategy to generate radicals in situ from aromatic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters by using a photocatalyst. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, a small amount of photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 generates a transient &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical and persistent ketyl radical in situ. In contrast to the well&#8208;established approaches, neither stoichiometric external oxidant nor reductant is required for this reaction. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by pinacol coupling of ketyl radicals and benzannulation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals with alkynes to give a series of highly substituted 1&#8208;naphthols in good to excellent yields. The readily available photocatalyst, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and high functional&#8208;group tolerance make this reaction a useful synthetic tool.

      <dc:description>
Deep pockets: Heck arylation of nonconjugated dienes under palladium catalysis produces &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes, which can be trapped by various amines to give substituted cyclohexenylamines with good enantioselectivity and exclusively trans configuration. The weakly donating diphosphate ligand Kelliphite forms a deep unsymmetrical pocket, which is essential for stereoselective anti attack of amines.







Abstract
Substituted cyclohexylamines are becoming increasingly important in drug discovery. Asymmetric Heck insertion/amination of nonconjugated cyclodienes proceeds to give 5&#8208;aryl cyclohexenylamines with good enantioselectivity and exclusive trans configurations. Primary and secondary anilines, indoline, and benzylamines are suitable amines. The weakly donating diphosphite Kelliphite forms a deep unsymmetrical pocket, which is essential for stereoselective anti attack of amines.

      <title>Anchored Mediator Enabling Shuttle&#8208;Free Redox Mediation in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The shuttling phenomenon is the most severe drawback of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries, caused by the freely mobile nature of RMs. The shuttle effect was eliminated by anchoring RMs on the air electrode in form of a polymer. Successful prevention of the shuttle effect results in a remarkable improvement of the lithium&#8208;oxygen cell&#8208;performance.







Abstract
Redox mediators (RMs) are considered an effective countermeasure to reduce the large polarization in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient enhancement of the cyclability is limited by the trade&#8208;offs of freely mobile RMs, which are beneficial for charge transport but also trigger the shuttling phenomenon. Here, we successfully decoupled the charge&#8208;carrying redox property of RMs and shuttling phenomenon by anchoring the RMs in polymer form, where physical RM migration was replaced by charge transfer along polymer chains. Using PTMA (poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;yl methacrylate)) as a polymer model system based on the well&#8208;known RM tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), it is demonstrated that PTMA can function as stationary RM, preserving the redox activity of TEMPO. The efficiency of RM&#8208;mediated Li2O2 decomposition remains remarkably stable without the consumption of oxidized RMs or degradation of the lithium anode, resulting in an improved performance of the lithium&#8208;oxygen cell.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shuttling phenomenon&lt;/b&gt; is the most severe drawback of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries, caused by the freely mobile nature of RMs. The shuttle effect was eliminated by anchoring RMs on the air electrode in form of a polymer. Successful prevention of the shuttle effect results in a remarkable improvement of the lithium&#8208;oxygen cell&#8208;performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox mediators (RMs) are considered an effective countermeasure to reduce the large polarization in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient enhancement of the cyclability is limited by the trade&#8208;offs of freely mobile RMs, which are beneficial for charge transport but also trigger the shuttling phenomenon. Here, we successfully decoupled the charge&#8208;carrying redox property of RMs and shuttling phenomenon by anchoring the RMs in polymer form, where physical RM migration was replaced by charge transfer along polymer chains. Using PTMA (poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;yl methacrylate)) as a polymer model system based on the well&#8208;known RM tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), it is demonstrated that PTMA can function as stationary RM, preserving the redox activity of TEMPO. The efficiency of RM&#8208;mediated Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition remains remarkably stable without the consumption of oxidized RMs or degradation of the lithium anode, resulting in an improved performance of the lithium&#8208;oxygen cell.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Three hole transport materials (HTMs) based on a substituted triphenylamine moiety have been synthesized and successfully employed in triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide PSCs, reaching efficiencies of 19.4&#8201;%. The efficiencies, comparable to those obtained using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, point them out as promising candidates for easily attainable and cost&#8208;effective alternatives for PSCs, given their facile synthesis from commercially available materials. Interestingly, although all these HTMs show similar chemical and physical properties, they provide different carrier recombination kinetics. Our results demonstrate that is feasible through the molecular design of the HTM to minimize carrier losses and, thus, increase the solar cell efficiencies.

      <title>Li/Garnet Interface Stabilization by Thermal&#8208;Decomposition Vapor Deposition of an Amorphous Carbon Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermal decomposition vapor deposition of a graphitized carbon modification layer provides air stability and a contaminant&#8208;free surface of a garnet electrolyte. It also leads to an improved Li/garnet interface with high current density endurance and polarization voltage stability.







Abstract
Applying interlayers is the main strategy to address the large area specific resistance (ASR) of Li/garnet interface. However, studies on eliminating the Li2CO3 and LiOH interfacial lithiophobic contaminants are still insufficient. Here, thermal&#8208;decomposition vapor deposition (TVD) of a carbon modification layer on Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) provides a contaminant&#8208;free surface. Owing to the protection of the carbon layer, the air stability of LLZTO is also improved. Moreover, owing to the amorphous structure of the low graphitized carbon (LGC), instant lithiation is achieved, and the ASR of the Li/LLZTO interface is reduced to 9&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2. Lithium volatilization and Zr4+ reduction are also controllable during TVD. Compared with its high graphitized carbon counterpart (HGC), the LGC&#8208;modified Li/LLZTO interface displays a higher critical current density of 1.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as moderate Li plating and stripping, which provides enhanced polarization voltage stability.

Abstract
The first alkali&#8208;metal vanadium iodate fluoride, CsVO2F(IO3), with a novel 3D anionic framework, has been rationally designed and hydrothermally synthesized. The 3D [VO2F(IO3)]&#8722; framework in CsVO2F(IO3) is built from 0D &#923;&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;[VO3F(IO3)2]4&#8722; polyanions via corner&#8208;sharing of oxo anions and bridging of the iodate groups. CsVO2F(IO3) displays both a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) 1.1 times as strong as KTiOPO4 (KTP) under 2.05&#8197;&#956;m laser radiation and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT) of 107.9&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new route to design SHG crystals with stable 3D anionic structures from low&#8208;dimensional structural building units.

Metal&#8211;organic framework cathodes usually exhibit low capacity and poor electrochemical performance for Li&#8208;ion storage owing to intrinsic low conductivity and inferior redox activity. Now a redox&#8208;active 2D copper&#8211;benzoquinoid (Cu&#8208;THQ) MOF has been synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. The abundant porosity and intrinsic redox character endow the 2D Cu&#8208;THQ MOF with promising electrochemical activity. Superior performance is achieved as a Li&#8208;ion battery cathode with a high reversible capacity (387&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), large specific energy density (775&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1), and good cycling stability. The reaction mechanism is unveiled by comprehensive spectroscopic techniques: a three&#8208;electron redox reaction per coordination unit and one&#8208;electron redox reaction per copper ion mechanism is demonstrated. This elucidatory understanding sheds new light on future rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based cathode materials for efficient energy storage and conversion.

      <title>Conformational Dynamics of Monomer&#8208; versus Dimer&#8208;like Features in a Naphthalenediimide&#8208;Based Conjugated Cyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
A shining duo: A pair of conjugated cyclophane enantiomers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Cyclo&#8208;NDIs, is reported. The spatial electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI is modulated by external stimuli such as the temperature and solvent polarity, resulting in large optical changes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based cyclophanes (Cyclo&#8208;NDIs) are reported. Each enantiomer of Cyclo&#8208;NDI exhibits a circularly polarized luminescence signal with a relatively large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3). We have further investigated the modulation of through&#8208;space electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented NDIs in a discrete Cyclo&#8208;NDI with changes in the temperature. Tuning of the electronic communication results from the conformational transformation of monomer&#8208; versus dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI, as confirmed by UV/Vis, fluorescence, circular dichroic, and NMR spectroscopic analysis. The temperature&#8208;dependent optical response in the Cyclo&#8208;NDI through the conformational transformation could be utilized as a highly sensitive and reversible optical thermometer in a wide temperature range (100 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C).

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 2&#8208;Amidoacrylates</title>
      <dc:description>
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;amidoacrylates using a catalyst based on earth&#8208;abundant nickel has been developed. The hydrogenated products are obtained with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee) and high catalytic efficiency (S/C up to 2000) and can be simply converted into chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant nickel, coordinated with a suitable chiral bisphosphine ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;amidoacrylates, affording the chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). The active catalyst component was studied by NMR and HRMS, which helped us to realize high catalytic efficiency on a gram scale with a low catalyst loading (S/C=2000). The hydrogenated products could be simply converted into chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, and their bioactive derivatives. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was investigated using deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and computational calculations.

      <title>(NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5: An Unusual Ammonium&#8208;Containing Metal Iodate Fluoride Showing Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Thermochromic Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
Multitalented: The introduction of ammonium into a bismuth iodate fluoride to give (NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5 led to a crystal showing a subtle balance of a strong second harmonic generation effect, large birefringence, and a high laser damage threshold. In particular, the crystal exhibited unusual thermochromism. Such multifunctional behavior expands the potential of nonlinear optical materials (see picture).







Abstract
An ammonium&#8208;containing metal iodate fluoride compound, (NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5, featuring a two&#8208;dimensional double&#8208;layered framework constructed by [BiO2F5]6&#8722; and [BiO4F4]9&#8722; polyhedra, as well as [IO3]&#8722; groups, was successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;ordered alignment of these SHG&#8208;active units leads to an extraordinary strong SHG response of 9.2 times that of KDP. Moreover, this compound possesses a large birefringence (&#916;n=0.0690 at 589.3&#8197;nm), a wide energy band gap (Eg=3.88&#8197;eV), and a high laser damage threshold (LDT; 40.2&#215;AgGaS2). In particular, thermochromic behavior was observed for the first time in this type of compound. Such multifunctional crystals will expand the application of nonlinear optical materials.

      <title>Synthesis of Anisotropic ZnSe Nanorods with Zinc Blende Crystal Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
ZnSe nanorods with the cubic zinc blende crystal structure are synthesized from anisotropic nuclei by an anisotropic growth mechanism.







Abstract
Compared with the well&#8208;explored cadmium&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional nanorods (NRs), it is still a challenge to produce heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free II&#8211;VI semiconductor analogues with a controlled size, shape, and crystal structure. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards ZnSe NRs with a zinc blende crystal structure is presented, where use of the anisotropic nuclei produced via a high&#8208;temperature selenium injection favors anisotropic growth. Elongated ZnSe NRs were produced from anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, while spherical ZnSe nanocrystals were obtained starting from isotropic nuclei. The different free energy at (111) and (220) planes in anisotropic ZnSe nuclei induces the anisotropic growth of (111) plane for ZnSe NRs. Proper choice of the capping ligand (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) has an important implication for the formation of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei and also allows the control of the diameter of the final ZnSe NRs by limiting the growth of the (220) crystal plane of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei.

      <title>Preferential Formation of Mono&#8208;Metallofullerenes Governed by the Encapsulation Energy of the Metal Elements: A Case Study on Eu@C2n (2n=74&#8211;84) Revealing a General Rule</title>
      <dc:description>
Energy trumps size: The encapsulation energy of endohedral metal elements is shown to be a key factor which governs the preferential formation of mono&#8208;metallofullerenes during the arc&#8208;discharge when europium is used. This concept also rationalizes similar observations for metallofullerenes containing other metals for example, Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb.







Abstract
Encapsulating one to three metal atoms or a metallic cluster inside fullerene cages affords endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) classified as mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and cluster&#8208;EMFs, respectively. Although the coexistence of various EMF species in soot is common for rare&#8208;earth metals, we herein report that europium tends to prefer the formation of mono&#8208;EMFs. Mass spectroscopy reveals that mono&#8208;EMFs (Eu@C2n) prevail in the Eu&#8208;containing soot. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the encapsulation energy of the endohedral metal accounts for the selective formation of mono&#8208;EMFs and rationalize similar observations for EMFs containing other metals like Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb. Consistently, all isolated Eu&#8208;EMFs are mono&#8208;EMFs, including Eu@D3h(1)&#8208;C74, Eu@C2v(19138)&#8208;C76, Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C78, Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C80, and Eu@D3d(19)&#8208;C84, which are identified by crystallography. Remarkably, Eu@C2v(19138)&#8208;C76 represents the first Eu&#8208;containing EMF with a cage that violates the isolated&#8208;pentagon&#8208;rule, and Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C78 is the first C78&#8208;based EMF stabilized by merely one metal atom.

      <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Round round get around: An FeII&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic aerobic oxidation of alcohols was developed based on the biological oxidation of alcohols in the respiratory chain. Electron transfer from the alcohol to molecular oxygen occurs via three coupled catalytic redox cycles, leading to a low&#8208;energy pathway. An Fe complex was utilized as a substrate&#8208;selective catalyst, along with a quinone and an oxygen&#8208;activating Co complex as electron&#8208;transfer mediators.







Abstract
We report the first FeII&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The principle of this oxidation, which involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is reminiscent of biological oxidation in the respiratory chain. The electron transfer from the alcohol to molecular oxygen occurs with the aid of three coupled catalytic redox systems, leading to a low&#8208;energy pathway. An iron transfer&#8208;hydrogenation complex was utilized as a substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation catalyst, along with an electron&#8208;rich quinone and an oxygen&#8208;activating Co(salen)&#8208;type complex as electron&#8208;transfer mediators. Various primary and secondary alcohols were oxidized in air to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones with this method in good to excellent yields.

      <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of a Copper&#8208;based Electrocatalyst for Selective Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>
Ammonia boost: CuO NWAs are efficient nitrate electroreduction catalysts for the selective synthesis of ammonia. In&#8197;situ experiments revealed that CuO was electrochemically converted into Cu/Cu2O, which serves as an active phase. The electron transfer at the interface of Cu/Cu2O could facilitate the formation of *NOH intermediate and suppress the competitive H2 production.







Abstract
Unveiling the active phase of catalytic materials under reaction conditions is important for the construction of efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction to ammonia. The origin of the prominent activity enhancement for CuO (Faradaic efficiency: 95.8&#8201;%, Selectivity: 81.2&#8201;%) toward selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia was probed. 15N isotope labeling experiments showed that ammonia originated from nitrate reduction. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and colorimetric methods were performed to quantify ammonia. In&#8197;situ Raman and ex&#8197;situ experiments revealed that CuO was electrochemically converted into Cu/Cu2O, which serves as an active phase. The combined results of online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and DFT calculations demonstrated that the electron transfer from Cu2O to Cu at the interface could facilitate the formation of *NOH intermediate and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency.

      <title>Formation of an Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Ag112 Silver Nanocluster as Promoted by Chloride Released In Situ from CH2Cl2</title>
      <dc:description>
Clever Cl: A large silver nanocluster, [Ag112Cl6(C&#8801;CAr)51]3&#8722;, composed of four concentric core&#8211;shell structures (Ag13@Ag42@Ag48@Ag9) was obtained by reducing alkynyl&#8211;silver precursors with the weak reducing agent diphenylsilane. The in situ release of chloride ions from the CH2Cl2 solvent was critical for formation of the nanocluster, in which four different alkynyl&#8211;silver binding modes are observed (see picture).







Abstract
By directly reducing alkynyl&#8211;silver precursors, we successfully obtained a large alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanocluster, (C7H17ClN)3[Ag112Cl6(C&#8801;CAr)51], which is hitherto the largest structurally characterized silver nanocluster in the alkynyl family. The cluster exhibits four concentric core&#8211;shell structures (Ag13@Ag42@Ag48@Ag9), and four types of alkynyl&#8211;silver binding modes are observed. Chloride was found to be critical for the stabilization and formation of the silver nanocluster. The release of chloride ions in situ from CH2Cl2 solvent has been confirmed by mass spectrometry. This study suggests that the combination of alkynyl and halide ligands will pave a new way for the synthesis of large silver nanoclusters.

      <title>Guest Exchangeable Length&#8208;Controlled Discrete Tubes via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry in confined space constructed from macrocyclic molecules has attracted much attention, because it can utilize the specific binding properties of macrocyclic cavities. Here we report preparation of length&#8208;controlled discrete tubular structures by homo&#8208;/co&#8208;assembly of rim&#8208;differentiated and peralkylamino pillar[5]arenes via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. By dimerization and trimerization, the expanded tubes showed five&#8208;fold helices and staged binding, respectively. We found that the exchange speed of guest molecules in the tubes could be controlled by varying the tube length.</dc:description>

      <title>Charge&#8208;Tagged DNA Radicals in the Gas Phase Characterized by UV/Vis Photodissociation Action Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;tagged adenosine radicals: An N&#8208;7&#8208;H adduct to adenosine was synthesized in the gas phase and characterized through the UV/Vis action spectrum, matching the theoretical vibronic spectrum.







Abstract
Adenosine radicals tagged with a fixed&#8208;charge group were generated in the gas phase and structurally characterized by tandem mass spectrometry, deuterium labeling, and UV/Vis action spectroscopy. Experimental results in combination with Born&#8211;Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, ab&#8197;initio, and excited&#8208;state calculations led to unambiguous assignment of adenosine radicals as N&#8208;7 hydrogen atom adducts. The charge&#8208;tagged radicals were found to be electronically equivalent to natural DNA nucleoside radicals.

      <title>Stereospecific Asymmetric Synthesis of Tertiary Allylic Alcohol Derivatives by Catalytic [2,3]&#8208;Meisenheimer Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral acyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are very important synthetic building blocks, but their enantioselective synthesis is often challenging. A major limitation in catalytic asymmetric 1,2&#8208;addition approaches to ketones is the enantioface differentiation by steric distinction of both ketone residues. In this communication we report the development of a catalytic asymmetric Meisenheimer rearrangement to overcome this problem, as it proceeds in a stereospecific manner. This allows for high enantioselectivity also for the formation of products in which the residues at the generated tetrasubstituted stereocenter display a similar steric demand. Low catalyst loadings were found to be sufficient and the reaction conditions were mild enough to tolerate even highly reactive functional groups such as an enolizable aldehyde, a primary tosylate or an epoxide. Our investigations suggest an intramolecular rearrangement pathway.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The controlled synthesis of multicomponent MOFs allows for the precise placement of multiple corporative functional groups within a framework, leading to emergent synergistic effects. Herein, we demonstrate that &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent sensors can be assembled by combining a fluorophore and a recognition moiety within a complex cavity of a multicomponent MOF. An anthracene&#8208;based fluorescent linker and a hemicyanine&#8208;containing CN&#8722; responsive linker were sequentially installed into the lattice of PCN&#8208;700. The selective binding of CN&#8208; to hemicyanine inhibited the energy transfer between the two moieties, resulting in a fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; effect. Taking advantage of the high tunability of the MOF platform, the ratio between anthracene and the hemicyanine moiety could be fine&#8208;tuned in order to maximize the sensitivity of the overall framework.

      <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Self&#8208;Assembly for Scalable Preparation of Highly Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>Mesoporous metal oxides (MMOs) have been demonstrated great potential in various applications. Up to now, the direct synthesis of MMOs is still limited to the solvent induced inorganic&#8208;organic self&#8208;assembly process. Here, we develop a facile, general, and high throughput solvent&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a series of MMOs including single&#8208;component MMOs and multi&#8208;component MMOs (e.g., doped MMOs, composite MMOs, and polymetallic oxide) with high crystallinity and remarkable porous properties by grinding and heating raw materials. Compared with the traditional solution self&#8208;assembly process, the avoidance of solvents in this method not only greatly increases the yield of target products and synthesis efficiency, but also reduces the environmental pollution and the consumption of cost and energy. We believe the presented approach will pave a new avenue for scalable production of advanced mesoporous materials for various applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Silica bilayer supported on Ru(0001): Following the crystalline to vitreous transformation in real time with spectro&#8208;microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The crystalline to vitreous phase transformation of a SiO  2  bilayer supported on Ru(0001) was studied by means of time&#8208;dependent LEED, local XPS and DFT calculations. The silica bilayer system constitutes a model system that has interesting parallels to 3D silica glass and can be used to understand the mechanism of the disorder transition. An Arrhenius analysis of the time constant for the phase transformation in the 2D hexagonal network of crystalline silica at variable temperature gives apparent activation energy values ( Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText ) of (4.2 &#177; 0.6) and (4.1 &#177; 0.2) eV for the transformation in UHV and O  2  atmosphere, respectively. The differences observed in the Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText values lie within the experimental accuracy of the determination. DFT simulations show that the formation of a Stone&#8208;Wales type of defect follows a complex mechanism, where the two layers show decoupled behavior in terms of chemical bond rearrangements. The calculated activation energy of the rate determining step for the formation of a Stone&#8208;Wales type of defect of 4.3 eV is in a very good agreement with the experimental value. Charge transfer between SiO  2  bilayer and Ru(0001) support is shown to lower the activation energy for breaking the Si&#8208;O bond compared to the unsupported film. The pre&#8208;exponential factors obtained under both atmospheres differ significantly, thus suggesting that the interfacial O  Ru  underneath the SiO  2  bilayer plays a role on how the disordering propagates within the film.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of d3 Molybdenum&#8208;Oxo Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Reduction of d  2  metal&#8211;oxo ions of the form [MO(PP)  2  Cl]  +  (M = Mo, W; PP = chelating diphosphine) produces d  3  MO(PP)  2  Cl complexes, which include the first isolated examples in group 6. The stability and reactivity of the MO(PP)  2  Cl compounds are found to depend upon the steric bulk of the phosphine ligands: derivatives with bulky phosphines that shield the oxo ligand are stable enough to be isolated, whereas those with phosphines that leave the oxo ligand exposed are more reactive and observed transiently. Magnetic measurements and DFT calculations on MoO(dppe)  2  Cl indicate the d  3  compounds are low spin with a  2  [(d  xy  )  2  (&#960;*(MoO)  1  ] configuration. X&#8208;ray crystallographic and vibrational&#8208;spectroscopic studies on d  2  and d  3  [MoO(dppe)  2  Cl]  0/+  establish that the d  3  compound possesses a reduced M&#8211;O bond order and significantly longer Mo&#8211;O bond, accounting for its greater reactivity.

      <dc:description>The necessity for precision labeling of proteins emerged during the efforts to understand and regulate their structure and function.

Here, we report a method that enables single&#8208;site labeling of a high&#8208;frequency Lys residue in the native proteins.

These linchpins create the opportunity to regulate the position of second Lys&#8208;selective electrophile connected by a spacer. Consequently, it enables the irreversible single&#8208;site labeling of a Lys residue independent of its place in the reactivity order. The user&#8208;friendly protocol involves a series of steps to deconvolute and address chemoselectivity, site&#8208;selectivity, and modularity. Also, it delivers ordered immobilization and analytically pure probe&#8208;tagged proteins.

      <title>Nanoarchitectonics beyond Self&#8208;Assembly: Challenges to Create Bio&#8208;Like Hierarchic Organization</title>
      <dc:description>Incorporation of non&#8208;equilibrium actions in the sequence of self&#8208;assembly processes would be an effective means to establish bio&#8208;like high functionality hierarchic assemblies. As a novel methodology beyond self&#8208;assembly, nanoarchitectonics, which has as its aim the fabrication of functional materials systems from nanoscopic units through the methodological fusion of nanotechnology with other scientific disciplines including organic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, microfabrication, and bio&#8208;process, has been applied to this strategy.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of non&#8208;equilibrium actions in the sequence of self&#8208;assembly processes would be an effective means to establish bio&#8208;like high functionality hierarchic assemblies. As a novel methodology beyond self&#8208;assembly, nanoarchitectonics, which has as its aim the fabrication of functional materials systems from nanoscopic units through the methodological fusion of nanotechnology with other scientific disciplines including organic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, microfabrication, and bio&#8208;process, has been applied to this strategy. The application of non&#8208;equilibrium factors to conventional self&#8208;assembly processes is discussed on the basis of examples of directed assembly, Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett assembly, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly.

      <title>Nickel(II) Mediated Reversible Thiolate/Disulfide Conversion as a Mimic for a Key Step of The Catalytic Cycle of Methyl Coenzyme M Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>According to the well&#8208;accepted mechanism, methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase (MCR) involves Ni mediated thiolate to disulfide conversion that sustains its catalytic cycle of methane formation in the energy saving pathways of methanotrophic microbes. Model complexes that illustrate Ni ion mediated reversible thiolate/disulfide transformation are unknown. In this paper we report the synthesis, crystal structure, spectroscopic properties and redox interconversions of a set of NiII complexes comprising a tridentate N2S donor thiol and its analogous N4S2 donor disulfide ligands. These complexes demonstrate reversible NiII&#8208;thiolate/NiII&#8208;disulfide (both bound and unbound disulfide&#8208;S to NiII) transformations via thiyl and disulfide mono radical anions that resemble a primary step of MCR&#8217;s catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable meso&#8208;meso Linked 2NH&#8208;Corrole Radical Dimers as a Key Intermediate to Corrole Tape</title>

The stability of this peculiar product has been ascribed largely to strong antiferromagnetic interaction of the two spins. Further oxidation of this diradical produced the corrole tape, suggesting its involvement as a reaction intermediate to the corrole tape. As another example, oxidation of 10&#8208;10&#8217;&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridine&#8208;coordinated CoIII corrole dimer with DDQ produced a cobalt corrole radical dimer and a doubly&#8208;linked corrole dimer both as stable compounds bearing pyridine and cyanide axial ligands. Bis&#8208;pyridine&#8208;coordinated CoIII corrole monomer was also converted to the corresponding corrole radical upon treatment with cyanide anion. Further oxidation of the cobalt corrole radical dimer with p&#8208;chloranil gave the doubly&#8208;linked cobalt corrole dimer exclusively. This type of oxidative transformation involving neutral diradical intermediates is a unique reaction mechanism specific for corrole dimers.</dc:description>

      <title>Extending the Sensitivity of CEST to Micro&#8208;to&#8208;Millisecond Dynamics in Nucleic Acids Using High Power Radio&#8208;Frequency Fields</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Biomolecules undergo motions on the micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale to adopt low&#8208;populated transient states that play important roles in folding, recognition, and catalysis. NMR techniques such as CPMG, CEST and&#160;  R  1&#961;  are the most commonly used methods for characterizing such transitions at atomic resolution under solution conditions.

While some implementations of the&#160;  R  1&#961;  experiment are more broadly sensitive to motions on the micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale, they entail the use of selective irradiation schemes and inefficient 1D data acquisition methods. Here, we show that high power radio&#8208;frequency fields can be used in&#160; CEST experiments to extend sensitivity to faster motions on the micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale.&#160; Given the ease of implementing high power fields in CEST, the work described here should make it easier to characterize micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond dynamics in biomolecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Bi3+&#8208;Ln3+ (Ln = Er and Yb) codoped Cs2AgInCl6 Double Perovskite Near Infrared Emitter</title>
      <dc:description>Bi  3+  and lanthanide ions were previously codoped in metal oxides as optical sensitizers and emitters. But such codoping is not known in typical semiconductors like Si, GaAs, CdSe, since the coordination number (CN) for metal ions is 4, which is insufficient to accommodate large sized Bi  3+  and lanthanide ions. Metal halide perovskite with coordination number 6 provides an opportunity to codope Bi  3+  and lanthanide ions. Here we report codoping of Bi  3+  and Ln  3+  (Ln = Er and Yb) in Cs  2  AgInCl  6  double perovskite. Bi  3+  &#8208;Er  3+  codoped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  shows Er  3+  f  &#8208;electron emission at 1540 nm (suitable for low&#8208;loss optical communication). Bi  3+  codoping decreases the excitation (absorption) energy, such that the samples can be excited with ~370 nm light using a commercial UV light emitting diodes. At that excitation, Bi  3+  &#8208;Er  3+  codoped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  shows ~45 times higher emission intensity compared to the Er  3+  doped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  . Similar results are also observed in Bi  3+  &#8208;Yb  3+  codoped sample emitting at 994 nm. A combination of temperature dependent (5.7 K to 423 K) photoluminescence and first&#8208;principles calculation study is used to understand the optical sensitization and emission processes in Bi  3+  &#8208;Ln  3+  codoped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  .</dc:description>

The success of this method relies on the immiscibility between poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) in 2, 2, 2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) for the generation of PVP/TFE pockets on the surface of a PCL jet. The pockets are stretched and elongated along with the jet, eventually resulting in the formation of nanoscale grooves upon the removal of PVP. The presence of nanoscale grooves greatly enhances&#160;the outgrowth of neurites from both PC12 cells and chick embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) bodies, as well as the migration of Schwann cells.

      <title>Silk&#8208;inspired &#946;&#8208;peptide Materials Resist Fouling and the Foreign&#8208;body Response</title>
      <dc:description>The functions of implants like medical devices are often compromised by the host&#8217;s foreign&#8208;body response (FBR). Here, we developed low FBR materials inspired by serine&#8208;rich sericin from silk; our poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;homoserine (&#946;&#8208;HS) materials comprise the hydrophilic unnatural amino acid &#946;&#8208;homoserine.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The functions of implants like medical devices are often compromised by the host&#8217;s foreign&#8208;body response (FBR). Here, we developed low FBR materials inspired by serine&#8208;rich sericin from silk; our poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;homoserine (&#946;&#8208;HS) materials comprise the hydrophilic unnatural amino acid &#946;&#8208;homoserine.

      <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxides for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;sequins: A facile and spontaneous strategy for synthesizing silver&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated transition&#8208;metal hydroxide nanohybrids on carbon cloth is presented. The nanohybrids exhibit substantially enhanced OER activity and durability owing to the strong metal&#8211;support interaction and decreased reaction energetic barrier on the heterostructure nanocatalysts.







Abstract
The fabrication of metal&#8208;supported hybrid structures with enhanced properties typically requires external energy input, such as pyrolysis, photolysis, and electrodeposition. In this study, silver&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated transition&#8208;metal hydroxide (TMH) composites were synthesized by an approach based on a spontaneous redox reaction (SRR) at room temperature. The SRR between silver ions and TMH provides a simple and facile route to establish effective and stable heterostructures that can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Ag@Co(OH)x grown on carbon cloth exhibits outstanding OER activity and durability, even superior to IrO2 and many previously reported OER electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrates that the strong electronic interaction between Ag and Co(OH)2 activates the silver clusters as catalytically OER active sites, effectively optimizing the binding energies with reacted intermediates and facilitating the OER kinetics.

      <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Allenes by Direct Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Organolithium Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective formation of allenic product is achieved in the direct cross&#8208;coupling of allenyl&#8208; and propargyllithium species with aryl bromides. The synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenes is achieved in good to excellent yields without any previous formation of transition metal species. The fundamental role of ligand in the selectivity of the transformation is described and studied by experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between in&#8197;situ generated allenyl/propargyl&#8208;lithium species and aryl bromides to yield highly functionalized allenes is reported. The direct and selective formation of allenic products preventing the corresponding isomeric propargylic product is accomplished by the choice of SPhos or XPhos based Pd catalysts. The methodology avoids the prior transmetalation to other transition metals or reverse approaches that required prefunctionalization of substrates with leaving groups, resulting in a fast and efficient approach for the synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenes. Experimental and theoretical studies on the mechanism show catalyst control of selectivity in this allene formation.

      <title>Magnetothermal Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted Hierarchical Microfibers for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
A magnetothermal microfluidic method was used to design hierarchical carbon polyhedrons/holey graphene core&#8211;shell microfibers for a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor. The supercapacitor displayed ultrahigh energy density, large areal capacitance, and endurance for self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
Chemical architectures with an ordered porous backbone and high charge transfer are significant for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). However, owing to the sluggish ion kinetic diffusion and storage in compacted fibers, achieving high energy density remains a challenge. An innovative magnetothermal microfluidic method is now proposed to design hierarchical carbon polyhedrons/holey graphene (CP/HG) core&#8211;shell microfibers. Owing to highly magnetothermal etching and microfluidic reactions, the CP/HG fibers maintain an open inner&#8208;linked ionic pathway, large specific surface area, and moderate nitrogen active site, facilitating more rapid ionic dynamic transportation and accommodation. The CP/HG FSCs show an ultrahigh energy density (335.8&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and large areal capacitance (2760&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A self&#8208;powered endurance application with the integration of chip&#8208;based FSCs is designed to profoundly drive the durable motions of an electric car and walking robot.

      <title>Oriented (Local) Electric Fields Drive the Millionfold Enhancement of the H&#8208;Abstraction Catalysis Observed for Synthetic Metalloenzyme Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
Field study: The catalysis of hydrogen abstraction by two synthetic metalloenzymes which contain positively charged substituents on their respective macrocyclic ligands is investigated. The observed enhancement of reactivity is purely of electrostatic origin and associated with differential destabilizations of the reactants and the transition state.







Abstract
This contribution follows the recent remarkable catalysis observed by Groves et&#8197;al. in hydrogen&#8208;abstraction reactions by a)&#8197;an oxoferryl porphyrin radical&#8208;cation complex [Por&#8901;+FeIV(O)Lax] and b)&#8197;a hydroxoiron porphyrazine ferric complex [PyPzFeIII(OH)Lax], both of which involve positively charged substituents on the outer circumference of the respective macrocyclic ligands. These charge&#8208;coronated complexes are analogues of the biologically important Compound I (Cpd&#8197;I) and synthetic hydroxoferric species, respectively. We demonstrate that the observed enhancement of the H&#8208;abstraction catalysis for these systems is a purely electrostatic effect, elicited by the local charges embedded on the peripheries of the respective macrocyclic ligands. Our findings provide new insights into how electrostatics can be employed to tune the catalytic activity of metalloenzymes and can thus contribute to the future design of new and highly efficient hydrogen&#8208;abstraction catalysts.

Monoamine oxidases have two functionally distinct but structurally similar isoforms (MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B).

Hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and anthracene photodimerization results in an actuator with high mechanical strength, fast self&#8208;healing, and recyclability.







Abstract
The most pressing challenges for light&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators include reliance on UV light, slow response, poor mechanical properties, and limited functionalities. Now, a supramolecular design strategy is used to address these issues. Key is the use of a benzylimine&#8208;functionalized anthracene group, which red&#8208;shifts the absorption into the visible region and also stabilizes the supramolecular network through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Acid&#8211;ether hydrogen bonds are incorporated for energy dissipation under mechanical deformation and maintaining hydrophilicity of the network. This double&#8208;crosslinked supramolecular hydrogel developed via a simple synthesis exhibits a unique combination of high strength, rapid self&#8208;healing, and fast visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven shape morphing both in the wet and dry state. As all of the interactions are dynamic, the design enables the structures to be recycled and reprogrammed into different 3D objects.

      <title>A Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Hybrid Membrane with High On/Off Photoswitchable Proton Conductivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;regulated proton conduction in MOF membranes was realized by in&#8197;situ encapsulation of light&#8208;active molecules into 3D frameworks. The hybrid membrane has high proton conductivity and outstanding switchable properties, making it feasible to control the lightening of a LED lamp assembled into an optically controlled circuit.







Abstract
Mimicking biological proton pumps to achieve stimuli&#8208;responsive protonic solids has long been of great interest for their diverse applications in fuel cells, chemical sensors, and bio&#8208;electronic devices. Now, dynamic light&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework hybrid membranes can be obtained by in&#8197;situ encapsulation of photoactive molecules (sulfonated spiropyran, SSP), as the molecular valve, into the cavities of the host ZIF&#8208;8. The configuration of SSP can be changed and switched reversibly in response to light, generating different mobile acidic protons and thus high on/off photoswitchable proton conductivity in the hybrid membranes and device. This device exhibits a high proton conductivity, fast response time, and extremely large on/off ratio upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. This approach might provide a platform for creating emerging smart protonic solids with potential applications in the remote&#8208;controllable chemical sensors or proton&#8208;conducting field&#8208;effect transistors.

      <title>Luminescent Metallacycle&#8208;Cored Liquid Crystals Induced by Metal Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>
Two luminescent rhomboidal metallacycles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties were prepared by metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. One of the metallacycles also was liquid&#8208;crystalline owing to the intermolecular packing of the metallacycles, indicating that the liquid&#8208;crystal properties could be induced by metal&#8208;coordination interactions.







Abstract
Two rhomboidal metallacycles based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly are presented. Because metal&#8208;coordination interactions restrict the rotation of phenyl groups on tetraphenylethene units, these metallacycles were emissive both in solution and in solid state, and their aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties were well&#8208;retained. Moreover, the rhomboidal metallacyclic structures offer a platform for intermolecular packing beneficial for the formation of liquid crystalline phases. Therefore, although neither of building blocks shows mesogenic properties, both thermotropic and lyotropic (in DMF) mesophases were observed in one of metallacycles, indicating that mesophases could be induced by metal&#8208;coordination interactions. This study not only reveals the mechanism for the formation of cavity&#8208;cored liquid crystals, but also provides a convenient approach to preparing supramolecular luminescent liquid crystals, which will serve as good candidates for chemo sensors and liquid crystal displays.

      <title>Metal Alkyls with Alkylidynic Metal&#8208;Carbon Bond Character: Key Electronic Structures in Alkane Metathesis Precatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Triple or nothing. Metal alkyls that display catalytic activity in alkane metathesis show particularly deshielded 13C chemical shifts and almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensors that indicate an alkylidynic character of the metal&#8208;carbon bonds. This electronic structure favors the formation of metal alkylidynes, which are key intermediates in alkane metathesis.







Abstract
The homologation of alkanes via alkane metathesis is catalyzed at low temperatures (150&#8201;&#176;C) by the silica&#8208;supported species (&#8801;SiO)WMe5 and (&#8801;SiO)TaMe4, while (&#8801;SiO)TaMe3Cp* is inactive. The contrasting reactivity is paralleled by differences in the 13C&#8197;NMR signature; the former display significantly more deshielded isotropic chemical shifts (&#948;iso) and almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensors, similar to what is observed in their molecular precursors TaMe5 and WMe6. Analysis of the chemical shift tensors reveals the presence of a triple&#8208;bond character in their metal&#8208;carbon (formally single) bond. This electronic structure is reflected in their propensity to generate alkylidynes and to participate in alkane metathesis, further supporting the role of alkylidynes as key reaction intermediates. This study establishes chemical shift as a descriptor to identify potential alkane metathesis catalysts.

      <title>Element&#8211;Element Bond Formation upon Oxidation and Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Unexpected E&#8722;E bond formation: The versatile redox chemistry of the polypnictogen cobalt complexes [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(E2)2] (E=P, As) was investigated. Both oxidation and reduction lead to the formation of two new E&#8722;E bonds and to the cyclization of the separated E2 ligands into E4 ligands in the coordination sphere of two {Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co} fragments.







Abstract
The redox chemistry of [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)2] (E=P (1), As (2); Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri(tert&#8208;butyl)cyclopentadienyl) was investigated. Both compounds can be oxidized and reduced twice. That way, the monocations [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;E4)][X] (E=P, X=BF4 (3&#8201;a), [FAl] (3&#8201;b); E=As, X=BF4 (4&#8201;a), [FAl] (4&#8201;b)), the dications [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;E4)][TEF]2 (E=P (5), As (6)), and the monoanions [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)(dme)2][(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;E4)] (E=P (7), As (8)) were isolated. Further reduction of 7 leads to the dianionic complex [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)(dme)2][K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)][(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P4)] (9), in which the cyclo&#8208;P4 ligand has rearranged to a chain&#8208;like P4 ligand. Further reduction of 8 can be achieved with an excess of potassium under the formation of [K(dme)4][(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;As3)] (10) and the elimination of an As1 unit. Compound 10 represents the first example of an allylic As3 ligand incorporated into a triple&#8208;decker complex.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Luminogens: A Material for Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging Independent of Probe Pretreatment and Probe Concentration</title>
      <dc:description>
Time will tell: Luminogens that efficiently emit thermally activated delayed fluorescence both in the monomeric and aggregated state are presented. Such a dual&#8208;phase strong and long&#8208;lived emission allows the material to be applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging, with an imaging efficiency that is independent of probe pretreatment and probe concentration.







Abstract
Developing luminescent probes with long lifetime and high emission efficiency is essential for time&#8208;resolved imaging. However, the practical applications usually suffer from emission quenching of traditional luminogens in aggregated states, or from weak emission of aggregation&#8208;induced emission type luminogens in monomeric states. Herein, we overcome this dilemma by a rigid&#8208;and&#8208;flexible alternation design in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor skeletons, to achieve a thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminogen with high emission efficiency both in the monomeric state (quantum yield up to 35.3&#8201;%) and in the aggregated state (quantum yield up to 30.8&#8201;%). Such a dual&#8208;phase strong and long&#8208;lived emission allows a time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging, with an efficiency independent of probe pretreatment and probe concentration. The findings open opportunities for developing luminescent probes with a usage in larger temporal and spatial scales.

      <title>EPR Distance Measurements on Long Non&#8208;coding RNAs Empowered by Genetic Alphabet Expansion Transcription</title>
      <dc:description>
UBPs meet EPR: Unnatural base pairs (UBPs) allow facile site&#8208;specific introduction of nitroxide spin labels into long RNAs by in&#8197;vitro transcription. Distances are determined in the glmS ribozyme and the 377&#8197;nt A&#8208;region of the long non&#8208;coding RNA Xist.







Abstract
We present herein a novel nitroxide spin label&#8208;containing RNA triphosphate TPT3NO and its application for site&#8208;specific spin&#8208;labeling of RNA through in&#8197;vitro transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Our strategy allows the facile preparation of spin&#8208;labeled RNAs with sizes ranging from short RNA oligonucleotides to large, complex RNA molecules with over 370 nucleotides by standard in&#8197;vitro transcription. As a proof of concept, inter&#8208;spin distance distributions are measured by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in short self&#8208;complementary RNA sequences and in a well&#8208;studied 185&#8197;nucleotide non&#8208;coding RNA, the B.&#8197;subtilis glmS ribozyme. The approach is then applied to probe for the first time the folding of the 377&#8197;nucleotide A&#8208;region of the long non&#8208;coding RNA Xist, by PELDOR.

      <title>Structural Diversification of Pillar[n]arene Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>
The next generation: Recent developments made in the field of pillar[n]arene&#8208;based macrocyclic molecules to go beyond single macrocyclic structures with two alkoxy&#8208;substituents on every benzene ring are highlighted. The recently introduced tiara[n]arenes, leaning pillar[n]arenes, and BowtieArenes with incomplete alkoxy substitution may be regarded as a next step in the structural diversification of pillar[n]arenes.







Abstract
Despite the fact that pillar[n]arenes receive major interest as building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and advanced materials, their functionalization is generally limited to the modification of the hydroxy or alkoxy units present on the rims. This limited structural freedom restricts further developments and has very recently been overcome. In this article, we highlight three very recent studies demonstrating further structural diversification of pillar[n]arenes by partial removal of the alkoxy substituents on the rims, which can be considered as the next generation of pillar[n]arenes.

      <title>Quantitative Prediction of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: A Full Quantum Mechanical Approach to the Optical Spectra</title>
      <dc:description>Full quantum mechanical (FQM) calculation of the excited state of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) materials is highly sought but still a challenging task. Herein, we employed the recently developed electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE&#8208;GMF) method, a method based on the systematic fragmentation approach, to predict, for the first time, the spectra of a prototype AIE fluorophore: di(  p  &#8208;methoxylphenyl) dibenzofulvene (FTPE). Compared to the single molecular or QM/MM calculations, the EE&#8208;GMF method can significantly improve the accuracy, nearly reproducing the experimental optical spectra of the FTPE in both condensed phases. Importantly, we show that the conventional restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) mechanism cannot fully account for AIE, whereas the two&#8208;body intermolecular quantum mechanical interaction plays a crucial role in AIE. The success in quantitative predicting optical properties of AIE systems not only validates the FQM fragmentation approach, but also enables more effective design of new AIE materials with novel optical properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Perdeuterated conjugated polymers for ultralow&#8208;frequency magnetic resonance of OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>Formation of excitons in OLEDs is spin dependent and can be controlled by electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance, affecting device resistance and electroluminescence yield.

      <title>Direct dynamic evidence of charge separation in a dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell under operando conditions by Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Interfaces play an important role in enhancing the energy conversion performance of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs).

      <title>Triplet Energy Transfer from Ruthenium Complexes to Chiral Eniminium Ions: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#173;carbaldehydes by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral eniminium salts were prepared from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and a chiral proline&#8208;derived secondary amine. Upon irradiation with visible light, the eniminium ions underwent a ruthenium catalyzed (2.5&#160;mol%) intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition to olefins which, after hydrolysis, led to chiral cyclobutanecarbaldehydes (17 examples, 49&#8208;74% yield). The simple diastereoselectivity (61/39 to 95/5  dr  ) and the enantioselectivity (83/17 to 96/4  er  ) of the reaction were high in most examples. Ru(bpz)  3  (PF  6  )  2  was utilized as the standard ruthenium catalyst and laser flash photolysis studies provided evidence that the catalyst operates exclusively by triplet energy transfer (sensitization). The triplet energy E  T  of the respective aldehydes from which the eniminium ions were prepared is significantly higher (E  T  &#160;&#8776;&#160;280&#8208;300&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8722;1  ) than the triplet energy of the eniminium ions (E  T  &#160;&#8776;&#160;200&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8722;1  ). Upon judicious selection of a suitable ruthenium complex a catalytic system was devised in which a chiral secondary amine acts as co&#8208;catalyst. Optimization of the [2+2] photocycloaddition between cinnamic aldehyde and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#173;butadiene resulted in conditions which operate with either 20 mol% (55% yield, 82/18  er  ) or 50 mol% (42% yield, 96/4  er  ) of a chiral amine and 2.5 mol% of the ruthenium complex. In the catalytic reactions, Ru(bpy)  3  (PF  6  )  2  was employed instead of Ru(bpz)  3  (PF  6  )  2  . In line with its photophysical and electrochemical data, Ru(bpy)  3  (PF  6  )  2  is sug&#173;gested by laser flash photolysis experiments to undergo both electron and energy transfer. However, evidence was collected to support the hypothesis that energy transfer is the only productive quenching mechanism. Control experiments using Ir(ppy)  3  showed that a strong photochemical reductant did not catalyze the intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of an eniminium ion.</dc:description>

      <title>Integrating Allyl Electrophiles into Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Conjunctive Cross&#8208;Coupling
</title>
      <dc:description>
Nickel catalysis enables regioselective 1,2&#8208;allylmethylation of unactivated alkenes in a variety of N&#8208;allyl heterocycles. The resulting alkene product remains untouched and can be easily diversified.







Abstract
Allylation and conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling represent two useful, yet largely distinct, reactivity paradigms in catalysis. The union of these two processes would offer exciting possibilities in organic synthesis but remains largely unknown. Herein, we report the use of allyl electrophiles in nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling with a non&#8208;conjugated alkene and dimethylzinc. The transformation is enabled by weakly coordinating, monodentate aza&#8208;heterocycle directing groups that are useful building blocks in synthesis, including saccharin, pyridones, pyrazoles, and triazoles. The reaction occurs under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of allyl electrophiles. High chemoselectivity through substrate directivity is demonstrated by the facile reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;&#947; alkene of the starting material, whereas the &#1013;&#8208;&#950; alkene of the product is preserved. The generality of this approach is further illustrated through the development of an analogous method with alkyne substrates. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of the dissociation of the weakly coordinating directing group to allow the allyl moiety to bind and facilitate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) reductive elimination.

Herein, we report the use of allyl electrophiles in nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling with a non&#8208;conjugated alkene and dimethylzinc. The transformation is enabled by weakly coordinating, monodentate aza&#8208;heterocycle directing groups that are useful building blocks in synthesis, including saccharin, pyridones, pyrazoles, and triazoles. The reaction occurs under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of allyl electrophiles. High chemoselectivity through substrate directivity is demonstrated by the facile reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;&#947; alkene of the starting material, whereas the &#1013;&#8208;&#950; alkene of the product is preserved. The generality of this approach is further illustrated through the development of an analogous method with alkyne substrates. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of the dissociation of the weakly coordinating directing group to allow the allyl moiety to bind and facilitate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) reductive elimination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Origins of Boosted Charge Storage on Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>
A complete landscape of boosted charge storage on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbons is uncovered mechanistically. Heteroatom doping effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, pushing the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes even beyond the thermodynamic limit of water (1.23&#8197;V). It also leads to a lower adsorption energy and consequently more stored cations on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon, yielding more charge storage.







Abstract
Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to understanding the origin of boosted charge storage on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbons, none of the present studies has shown a whole landscape. Herein, by both experimental evidence and theoretical simulation, it is demonstrated that heteroatom doping not only results in a broadened operating voltage, but also successfully promotes the specific capacitance in aqueous supercapacitors. In particular, the electrolyte cations adsorbed on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon can effectively inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction, a key step of water decomposition during the charging process, which broadens the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes even beyond the thermodynamic limit of water (1.23&#8197;V). Furthermore, the reduced adsorption energy of heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon consequently leads to more stored cations on the heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon surface, thus yielding a boosted charge storage performance.

      <title>Cupin Variants as a Macromolecular Ligand Library for Stereoselective Michael Addition of Nitroalkanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rational alteration of the first and second coordination sphere within cupin protein produced robust artificial metalloenzymes. These mutants can catalyze enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent Michael addition reactions of nitroalkanes.







Abstract
Cupin superfamily proteins (TM1459) work as a macromolecular ligand framework with a double&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;barrel structure ligating to a Cu ion through histidine side chains. Variegating the first coordination sphere of TM1459 revealed that H52A and H54A/H58A mutants effectively catalyzed the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Michael addition reaction of nitroalkanes to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone. Moreover, calculated substrate docking signified C106N and F104W single&#8208;point mutations, which inverted the diastereoselectivity of H52A and further improved the stereoselectivity of H54A/H58A, respectively.

Abstract
Helical carbazole&#8208;based BODIPY analogues were readily synthesized via aza[7]helicenes.

      <title>Landornamides, antiviral ornithine&#8208;containing ribosomal peptides discovered by proteusin mining</title>
      <dc:description>Proteusins are a family of bacterial ribosomal peptides that largely remain hypothetical, genome&#8208;predicted metabolites. The only known members are the polytheonamide&#8208;type cytotoxins with remarkably complex structures due to numerous unusual posttranslational modifications (PTMs).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proteusins are a family of bacterial ribosomal peptides that largely remain hypothetical, genome&#8208;predicted metabolites. The only known members are the polytheonamide&#8208;type cytotoxins with remarkably complex structures due to numerous unusual posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Cyanobacteria contain large numbers of putative proteusin loci with highly variable sets of PTM gene candidates.

      <title>A Benchtop Method for Appending Protic Functional Groups to N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Protected Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
A straightforward and robust method to functionalize SERS&#8208;active gold nanoparticles with bifunctional N&#8208;heterocsyclic carbenes is presented. The method gives access to amine&#8208;functionalized surfaces and enables the amide coupling to be monitored by SERS.







Abstract
The remarkable resilience of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) gold bonds has quickly made NHCs the ligand of choice when functionalizing gold surfaces. Despite rapid progress using deposition from free or CO2&#8208;protected NHCs, synthetic challenges hinder the functionalization of NHC surfaces with protic functional groups, such as alcohols and amines, particularly on larger nanoparticles. Here, we synthesize NHC&#8208;functionalized gold surfaces from gold(I) NHC complexes and aqueous nanoparticles without the need for additional reagents, enabling otherwise difficult functional groups to be appended to the carbene. The resilience of the NHC&#8722;Au bond allows for multi&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. Beginning with the nitro&#8208;NHC, we form an amine&#8208;NHC terminated surface, which further undergoes amide coupling with carboxylic acids. The simplicity of this approach, its compatibility with aqueous nanoparticle solutions, and its ability to yield protic functionality, greatly expands the potential of NHC&#8208;functionalized noble metal surfaces.

      <title>Controlling Gas Selectivity in Molecular Porous Liquids by Tuning the Cage Window Size</title>
      <dc:description>
Control of pore window size: Narrowing the windows of the organic cage used to form molecular porous liquids leads to tuning of the gas selectivity. Pulsed&#8208;field gradient NMR spectroscopy is used to understand the selectivity.







Abstract
Control of pore window size is the standard approach for tuning gas selectivity in porous solids. Here, we present the first example where this is translated into a molecular porous liquid formed from organic cage molecules. Reduction of the cage window size by chemical synthesis switches the selectivity from Xe&#8208;selective to CH4&#8208;selective, which is understood using 129Xe, 1H, and pulsed&#8208;field gradient NMR spectroscopy.

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Activation at Metal Centers: Evolution of Charge Transfer from Mg&#8201;.+ to CO2 in [MgCO2(H2O)n].+, n=0&#8211;8</title>
      <dc:description>
One, two, three: Three water molecules activate carbon dioxide when coordinated to Mg&#8201;.+ in the gas phase, pushing electron density from the magnesium center since they are keen on interacting with an Mg2+ ion. For the same reason, they squeeze in between CO2.&#8722; and the metal center if there are five or more. This sequence of electron transfer followed by formation of a solvent&#8208;separated ion pair is unraveled by infrared spectroscopy.







Abstract
We investigate activation of carbon dioxide by singly charged hydrated magnesium cations Mg&#8201;.+(H2O)n, through infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The spectra of [MgCO2(H2O)n].+ in the 1250&#8211;4000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region show a sharp transition from n=2 to n=3 for the position of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode. This is evidence for the activation of CO2 via charge transfer from Mg&#8201;.+ to CO2 for n&#8805;3, while smaller clusters feature linear CO2 coordinated end&#8208;on to the metal center. Starting with n=5, we see a further conformational change, with CO2.&#8722; coordination to Mg2+ gradually shifting from bidentate to monodentate, consistent with preferential hexa&#8208;coordination of Mg2+. Our results reveal in detail how hydration promotes CO2 activation by charge transfer at metal centers.

      <dc:description>
To show the synthetic utility of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H activation cascade of 3&#8208;arylcyclopentanones, described are the collective concise and asymmetric syntheses of the terpenoids (&#8722;)&#8208;microthecaline&#8197;A, (&#8722;)&#8208;leubehanol, (+)&#8208;pseudopteroxazole, (+)&#8208;seco&#8208;pseudopteroxazole, pseudopterosin&#8197;A&#8211;F and G&#8211;J aglycones, and (+)&#8208;heritonin in four to nine steps.







Abstract

      <title>A Glutathione Activatable Ion Channel Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells by Depleting Intracellular Glutathione Levels</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer cells use elevated glutathione (GSH) levels as an inner line of defense to evade apoptosis and develop drug resistance. A 2,4&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl&#8208;protected 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide is described that compromises intracellular glutathione defense by activation of ion channels leading to production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis.







Abstract
Cancer cells use elevated glutathione (GSH) levels as an inner line of defense to evade apoptosis and develop drug resistance. In this study, we describe a novel 2,4&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNS) protected 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide system that exploits GSH for its activation into free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide forming supramolecular M+/Cl&#8722; channels. Better permeation of the DNS protected compound into MCF&#8208;7 cells compared to the free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide and GSH&#8208;activatable ion transport resulted in higher cytotoxicity, which was associated with increased oxidative stress that further reduced the intracellular GSH levels and altered mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The GSH&#8208;activatable transport&#8208;mediated cell death was further validated in rat insulinoma cells (INS&#8208;1E); wherein the intracellular GSH levels showed a direct correlation to the resulting cytotoxicity. Lastly, the active compound was found to restrict the growth and proliferation of 3D spheroids of MCF&#8208;7 cells with efficiency similar to that of the anticancer drug doxorubicin.

      <title>Catalytic Regioselective Isomerization of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes to Homoallylic Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Ring strain: 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted oxetanes, easily prepared by a double Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reaction, readily isomerize into homoallylic alcohols using B(C6F5)3 as a catalyst. DFT calculations show a key intramolecular proton migration. The synthetic potential was proven by the synthesis of several chiral disubstituted alcohols, with high enantiomeric excesses, by asymmetric hydrogenation of the homoallylic alcohols.







Abstract
The selective isomerization of strained heterocyclic compounds is an important tool in organic synthesis. An unprecedented regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes into homoallylic alcohols is described. The use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3), a commercially available Lewis acid was key to obtaining good yields and selectivities since other Lewis acids afforded mixtures of isomers and substantial polymerization. The reaction took place under exceptionally mild reaction conditions and very low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%). DFT calculations disclose the mechanistic features of the isomerization and account for the high selectivity displayed by the B(C6F5)3 catalyst. The synthetic applicability of the new reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of &#947;&#8208;chiral alcohols using iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.

      <title>Distal Allylic/Benzylic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Silyl Ethers Using Donor/Acceptor Rhodium(II) Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;H functionalization: Distal selective allylic/benzylic C&#8722;H functionalization of silyl ethers were developed by means of donor/acceptor carbene intermediates. The reactions proceed with high levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The potential of this methodology was illustrated by accessing a synthetically important heterocyclic scaffold.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective distal allylic/benzylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl and benzyl silyl ethers was achieved using rhodium(II) carbenes derived from N&#8208;sulfonyltriazoles and aryldiazoacetates as carbene precursors. The bulky rhodium carbenes led to highly site&#8208;selective functionalization of less activated allylic and benzylic C&#8722;H bonds even in the presence of electronically preferred C&#8722;H bonds located &#945; to oxygen. The dirhodium catalyst Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4 is the most effective chiral catalyst for triazole&#8208;derived carbene transformations, whereas Rh2(S&#8208;TPPTTL)4 works best for carbenes derived from aryldiazoacetates. The reactions afford a variety of &#948;&#8208;functionalized allyl silyl ethers with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The utility of the present method was demonstrated by its application to the synthesis of a 3,4&#8208;disubstituted l&#8208;proline scaffold.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Sulfonamides With (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
      <dc:description>The development of Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings of sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides is reported. These transformations, which were previously achievable only with Pd catalysis, are enabled by use of air&#8208;stable (  L  )NiCl(o&#8208;tol) pre&#8208;catalysts (L =  PhPAd&#8208;DalPhos  and  PAd2&#8208;DalPhos  ), without photocatalysis. The collective scope of (pseudo)halide electrophiles (X = Cl, Br, I, OTs, and OC(O)NEt  2  ) demonstrated herein is unprecedented for any reported catalyst system for sulfonamide C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling (Pd, Cu, Ni, or other).

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Chemotherapy by Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Differential Stress Sensitization</title>
      <dc:description>Most of current nanomedicines are administrated intravenously to favour tumor accumulation via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which, however, suffers from a number of drawbacks such as low drug bioavailability and severe side effect. Inspired from the advances in nutriology, in this work, we have constructed a doxorubicin(Dox)&#8208;based liposomal nanosystem, whose component is analogous to that of FDA&#8208;approved cancer nanomedicine Doxil  &#174;  , for tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy by enabling differential stress sensitization between cancer and normal cells for restricting the chemodrug toxicity exclusively in tumor regions. In detail, 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (2DG) was loaded in the nanoliposome to inhibit glycolysis of cancer cells, which works in synergy with the co&#8208;loaded chemodrug Dox to promote mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent apoptosis. In the meantime, the starvation effect of 2DG is able to counteract the toxicity of Dox in normal cells and thus mitigates the harmful side effect of chemotherapy. In vivo results also evidence that this engineered nanosystem features largely elevated therapeutic efficacy, mitigated side effects, as well as distinct anti&#8208;metastasis function. It is expected that such a differential stress sensitization strategy may greatly benefit future nanomedicine design.</dc:description>

      <title>Achieving Morphological Control over Lamellar Manganese Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Modulated Bi&#8208;phase Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials offer wealth of applications depending on if they are crystallized in bulk or layered nature. However, the control over this morphology is difficult especially for those involving metal cations with low electronegativity and uncontrollable kinetic reaction. Here, we report modulated bi&#8208;phase synthesis route towards large&#8208;scale manganese 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (MnBDC) with a precise control over their morphology i.e., bulk vs layered. In this bi&#8208;phase method, metal precursors and organic ligands are separated to reduce the kinetic reaction rates for better control over the crystallization process. Based on scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy studies, we find that the continuous ligand supply along with the presence of pyridine capping agent are highly effective in promoting the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth and achieving large crystal sizes. Once layered MnBDC is stabilized, we further used topotactic intercalation chemistry to demonstrate the feasibility of bromine intercalation on these layered materials. Comprehensive studies show that bromine intercalation is possible between the MOFs layers for the first time. Interestingly, bromine intercalation causes colossal reduction in layered MnBDC band gap while it has no observable effect on bulk MOFs. Overall results introduce novel manufacturing concepts to realize lamellar MOFs containing challenging metal cations and offer fundamental insights into their material properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused&#8208;Quinoxaline as Key Building Block for Highly Efficient and Stable Sensitizers in Copper Electrolyte Based Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on Cu(II/I) bipyridyl or phenanthroline complexes as redox shuttles have achieved very high open&#8208;circuit voltages (  V  OC  , &gt; 1 V). However, their short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (  J  SC  ) has remained modest. The challenge for increasing the  J  SC  is expected to extend the spectral response of sensitizers to the red or NIR region while maintaining efficient electron injection in the mesoscopic TiO  2  film and fast regeneration by the Cu(I) complex. Here, we report two new D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A featured sensitizers coded  HY63  and  HY64  , which employ either benzothiadiazole (BT) or phenanthrene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (PFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;withdrawing acceptor moiety. In spite of very similar energy levels and absorption onsets,  HY64  &#8208;based DSSCs outperform largely their  HY63  counterpart, achieving an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5% with superior stability. In depth studies of interfacial charge carrier dynamics show that PFQ is superior to BT in retarding charge recombination resulting in near quantitative collection of photogenerated charge carriers.</dc:description>

      <title>Beyond Mechanical Recycling: Giving New Life to Plastic Waste</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing the stream of recycled plastic from currently 12 wt.% necessitates an approach beyond traditional low value recycling via melting and re&#8208;extrusion. Various chemical recycling processes have great potential to enhance recycling rates, because a higher variety of plastic waste streams can be recycled leading to a higher purity and quality product than melting and re&#8208;extrusion. But despite long&#8208;standing efforts, commercial processes are still not operated at the volumes to address the recycling necessity. In this review, a summary of the various chemical recycling routes and assessment via life cycle analysis is complemented by a&#160;list of processes developed by companies active in chemical recycling. We show that each of the currently available processes is applicable for specific plastic waste streams. Thus, only a combination of different technologies can address the plastic waste problem. While pyrolysis can handle relatively mixed waste streams, it works best with polyolefins, PS and PMMA. Contaminations including PVC, PET and PU and non&#8208;plastic additives like glass fiber cause operational problems. Multilayer plastics containing these materials are best separated into mono&#8208;streams by dissolution/precipitation. Pure polyester or polyamide waste streams can be recycled by solvolysis techniques with high monomer recovery. Research should focus on more realistic, more contaminated and mixed waste streams, while collection and sorting infrastructure will need to be improved, i.e. by stricter regulation. This review aims to inspire both science and innovation for the production of higher value and quality products from plastic recycling suitable for reuse or valorization to create the necessary economic and environmental push for a circular economy.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of galactosyl&#8208;queuosine and distribution of hypermodified Q&#8208;nucleosides in mouse tissues</title>
      <dc:description>Queuosine (Q) is a hypermodified RNA nucleoside that is found in tRNA  His  , tRNA  Asn  , tRNA  Tyr  , and tRNA  Asp  . It is located at the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon loop, where it can interact both with U or C bases located at the respective position of the corresponding mRNA codons. In higher eukaryotes, including humans, the Q base is for yet unknown reasons further modified in tRNA  Tyr  and tRNA  Asp  by the addition of a galactose or mannose sugar, respectively. The reason for this additional modification, and how the sugar modification is orchestrated with Q&#8208;formation and insertion, is unknown. Here, we report a total synthesis of the hypermodified nucleoside galactosyl&#8208;queuosine (galQ). The availability of the compound enabled us to study the absolute levels of the Q&#8208;family nucleosides in six different organs of new&#8208;born and adult mice, and also in human cytosolic tRNA. Our synthesis now paves the way to a more detailed analysis of the biological function of the Q&#8208;nucleoside family.</dc:description>

      <title>An iron(II)&#8208; and  &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenase acts on nucleotide substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: While halogenated nucleosides are used as common anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;viral drugs, naturally occurring halogenated nucleosides are rare. Adechlorin (ade) is a 2&#8217;&#8208;chloro nucleoside natural product first identified from Actinomadura sp. ATCC 39365.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: While halogenated nucleosides are used as common anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;viral drugs, naturally occurring halogenated nucleosides are rare. Adechlorin (ade) is a 2&#8217;&#8208;chloro nucleoside natural product first identified from Actinomadura sp. ATCC 39365. However, the installation of chlorine in ade biosynthetic pathway still remains elusive.

      <title>Observation of Ion Electrosorption in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Micropores with in operando Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>

Here  in operando  small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to directly detect ion movements into the nanopores of a conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) electrode under operating conditions. Neutron scattering data reveals that most of the void space within the MOF is accessible to the solvent. Upon the addition of the electrolyte NaOTF, the ions are adsorbed on the outer surface of the protrusions to form a 30 &#197; layer instead of entering the ionophobic pores in the absence of an applied charging potential. The changes in scattering intensity when potentials are applied suggests the ion rearrangement in the micropores following different mechanisms depending on the electrode polarization.

      <title>Approaching the Integer&#8208;Charge Transfer Regime in Molecularly Doped Oligothiophenes by Efficient Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Symmetrical linear oligothiophenes are important model organic semiconductors. A library of such oligothiophenes was synthesized by an efficient decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling route. These compounds enable the critical oligomer length for integer&#8208;charge transfer upon molecular doping to be explored, thereby connecting the fundamentally different doping phenomenologies of oligo&#8208; and polythiophenes.







Abstract
A library of symmetrical linear oligothiophene was prepared employing decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key transformation. Thiophene potassium carboxylate salts were used as cross&#8208;coupling partners without the need of co&#8208;catalyst, base, or additives. This method demonstrates complete chemoselectivity and is a comprehensive greener approach compared to the existing methods. The modularity of this approach is demonstrated with the preparation of discreet oligothiophenes with up to 10 thiophene repeat units. Symmetrical oligothiophenes are prototypical organic semiconductors where their molecular electrical doping as a function of the chain length can be assessed spectroscopically. An oligothiophene critical length for integer charge transfer was observed to be 10 thiophene units, highlighting the potential use of discrete oligothiophenes as doped conduction or injection layers in organic electronics applications.

      <title>A Multi&#8208;action and Multi&#8208;target RuII&#8211;PtIV Conjugate Combining Cancer&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy to Overcome Drug Resistant Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>
Medicinal metal match: The treatment of cancer remains a major challenge in modern medicine. Herein, a novel approach combining a PtIV complex as chemotherapeutic drug and a RuII complex as an agent for photodynamic therapy is presented. The conjugate demonstrated to act on various cellular compartments with different mechanism on 2D monolayer cells as well as 3D multicellular tumor spheroids.







Abstract
PtII complexes are commonly used to treat cancer. To reduce their side effects and improve their pharmacological properties, PtIV complexes are being developed as prodrug candidates that are activated by reduction in cancer cells. Concomitantly, RuII polypyridine complexes have gained much attention as photosensitizers for use in photodynamic therapy due to their attractive characteristics. In this article, a novel PtIV&#8211;RuII conjugate, which combines cancer activated chemotherapy with PDT, is presented. Upon entering the cancer cell, the PtIV centre is reduced to PtII and the axial ligands including the RuII complex and phenylbutyrate are released. As each component has its individual targets, the conjugate exerts a multi&#8208;target and multi&#8208;action effect with (photo&#8208;)cytotoxicity values upon irradiation up to 595&#8197;nm in the low nanomolar range in various (drug resistant) 2D monolayer cancer cells and 3D multicellular tumour spheroids.

      <title>Polarity Umpolung Strategy for the Radical Alkylation of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Polarity switch: A novel, mild, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute protocol for radical alkylation of alkenes was developed using a polarity umpolung strategy. Both activated and challenging unactivated alkenes are suitable substrates. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.







Abstract
Free radical mediated alkylation of alkenes is a challenging and largely unmet goal. Disclosed here is a conceptually novel &#8220;polarity umpolung&#8221; strategy for radical alkylation of alkenes using a portfolio of easily accessed, difunctional alkylating reagents. This strategy is achieved by substituting inherently nucleophilic alkyl radicals with electrophilic sulfone&#8208;bearing surrogates, thus inverting the usual mode of reactivity. Along with alkylation, either an heteroaryl or oximino group is concurrently incorporated into the alkenes by a consecutive docking and migration process, leading to valuable products. The reaction displays a broad functional&#8208;group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.

      <title>Strong and Confined Acids Control Five Stereogenic Centers in Catalytic Asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclohexadienones with Cyclopentadiene</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cross&#8208;conjugated dienones containing electronically unbiased quaternary centers with cyclopentadiene has been developed. The chiral microenvironment and greater acidity of the imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) Br&#248;nsted acid motif control the desired outcome. The resulting cycloaddition adducts contain up to five stereogenic centers.







Abstract
We describe a highly enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cross&#8208;conjugated cyclohexadienones with cyclopentadiene, in which five stereocenters are effectively controlled by a strongly acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidate catalyst. Our approach provides tricyclic products in excellent stereoselectivity. We also report methods to convert the obtained products into useful intermediates and a computational study that aids in gaining deeper insight into the reaction mechanism and origin of stereoselectivity.

Abstract
The combination of supramolecular chemistry and soft colloids as microgels represents an ambitious way to develop multi&#8208;versatile colloidal assemblies. Hereafter, terpyridine&#8208;functionalized poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgel building blocks are shown to undergo an assemble&#8211;freeze&#8211;disassemble process. The microgel assemblies, which are controlled by monitoring the attractive and repulsive potentials between the soft colloidal particles, are then frozen by forming inter&#8208;particle metal&#8211;terpyridine bis&#8208;complexes upon addition of the metallic cation (such as FeII, CoII). By oxidation of the metal&#8211;terpyridine bis&#8208;complex links, the aggregates open up, which is due to the complex dissociation releasing the connected particles in the form of single microgels. We extended our work to the development of 1D filaments and 2D membranes materials made of soft particles connected via supramolecular chemistry.

      <title>An AIE&#8208;Active Conjugated Polymer with High ROS&#8208;Generation Ability and Biocompatibility for Efficient Photodynamic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Sunlight is the best disinfectant: A benzothiadiazole and tetraphenylethene&#8208;containing conjugated polymer (PTB&#8208;APFB) with high ROS&#8208;generation ability and selectivity for pathogenic microorganisms over mammalian cells was developed. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results show that PTB&#8208;APFB inhibits growth of bacteria efficiently, leading to recovery from infection 3&#8197;days faster than cefalotin.







Abstract
New, biocompatible materials with favorable antibacterial activity are highly desirable. In this work, we develop a unique conjugated polymer featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) for reliable bacterial eradication. Thanks to the AIE and donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure, this polymer shows a high reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generation ability compared to a low&#8208;mass model compound and the common photosensitizer Chlorin E6. Moreover, the selective binding of pathogenic microorganisms over mammalian cells was found, demonstrating its biocompatibility. The effective growth inhibition of bacteria upon polymer treatment under light irradiation was validated in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Notably, the recovery from infection after treatment with our polymer is faster than that with cefalotin. Thus, this polymer holds great promise in fighting against bacteria&#8208;related infections in practical applications.

      <title>Selective Acceptorless Dehydrogenation of Primary Amines to Imines by Core&#8211;Shell Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
The self&#8208;dehydrogenation and hetero&#8208;dehydrogenation of primary amines to their corresponding imines was achieved employing carbon supported cobalt nanoparticles coated with nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene shell. The catalyst is obtained via pyrolysis of a polymer ionic liquid with a CoCl42&#8722; counter&#8208;anion on a carbon support and shows unprecedented activity in these reactions.







Abstract
Core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts are attractive due to their versatility and stability. Here, we describe cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated within graphitic shells prepared via the pyrolysis of a cationic poly&#8208;ionic liquid (PIL) with a cobalt(II) chloride anion. The resulting material has a core&#8211;shell structure that displays excellent activity and selectivity in the self&#8208;dehydrogenation and hetero&#8208;dehydrogenation of primary amines to their corresponding imines. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the synthesis of secondary imines from substrates with various reducible functional groups (C=C, C&#8801;C and C&#8801;N) and amino acid derivatives.

      <title>Rapid Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bisphosphine Derivatives through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Hydrophosphination</title>
      <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric conjugate hydrophosphination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfides with diarylphosphines allows rapid construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine derivatives with diversified electronic nature and steric hindrance. This reaction is facilitated by the &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; interaction between copper(I) catalysts and phosphine sulfides.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Bisphosphines have been identified as one class of important and powerful chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis with transition metals. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfides was developed with the assistance of &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; interaction between copper(I)&#8208;catalyst and the phosphine sulfide moiety, which afforded 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine derivatives with diversified electronic nature and steric hindrance in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, the challenging catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphination/protonation reaction was achieved with excellent enantioselectivity. Strikingly, the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic diarylphosphines was also successfully carried out with high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Interestingly, the nucleophilic copper(I)&#8208;diphenylphosphide species was characterized by 31P&#8197;NMR spectrum and mass spectrum. At last, three products were transformed to chiral 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines, which were employed as ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester. The &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative was produced in high enantioselectivity, which demonstrated the utility of the present methodology.

      <title>Creation of Al&#8208;Enriched Mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 Nanoboxes with High Catalytic Activity: Converting Tetrahedral Extra&#8208;Framework Al into Framework Sites via Post Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanoboxes with accessible meso&#8208;micro&#8208;pore architecture and strong acid sites are important to heterogeneous catalysis suffering from mass transfer limitations and weak acidities. Rational design of parent zeolites with concentrated and non&#8208;protective coordination of Al species can facilitate the post&#8208;synthetic treatments to produce mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes. In this work, a simple and effective method was developed to prepare and convert parent MFI zeolites with tetrahedral extra&#8208;framework aluminium (EFAL) into Al&#8208;enriched mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes with low silicon&#8208;to&#8208;aluminium ratios (SARs) of ~16. The parent MFI zeolite was prepared by a strategy of rapid ageing of the zeolite sol gel synthesis mixture. The accessibility to the well&#8208;developed meso&#8208;micro&#8208;porous intra&#8208;crystalline network was probed systematically by comparative pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8208;NMR) diffusion measurements, which, in synergy with the high concentration of strong acidity of nanoboxes, provided superb catalytic activity and catalyst longevity in hydrocarbon cracking for producing propylene.</dc:description>

      <title>Organic Spherical Nucleic Acids Facilitate NIR&#8208;II Emitting Dye to Cross Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier</title>
      <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology plays an increasingly important role in the biomedical field; however, its application in the design of organic nanomaterials has still been underexplored. Herein, we innovatively exploit the DNA nanotechnology to aid a NIR&#8208;II emitting nanofluorophore to break through the limit of the brain&#8208;blood barrier (BBB) in non&#8208;invasive imaging of the brain tumor. Specifically, the DNA block copolymer, PS&#8208;  b  &#8208;DNA, is synthesized through a solid&#8208;phase &#8220;click&#8221; reaction. We demonstrate that its self&#8208;assembled structure shows exceptional cluster&#8208;effects, among which BBB&#8208;crossing is the most notable one. Therefore, for the first time, PS&#8208;  b  &#8208;DNA is utilized as an amphiphilic matrix to fabricate the NIR&#8208;II nanofluorephore and applied in  in vivo  bio&#8208;imaging. Accordingly, the DNA&#8208;based nanofluorophore shows a 3.8&#8208;fold enhancement in the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence signal of the glioblastoma imaging in comparison with the PEG&#8208;based counterpart. Undoubtedly, the notably increased imaging resolution will significantly benefit the further diagnosis and therapy of brain tumors.</dc:description>

Undoubtedly, the notably increased imaging resolution will significantly benefit the further diagnosis and therapy of brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Lead Mixed Oxyhalides Satisfying All Fundamental Requirements for High&#8208;Performance Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <dc:description>To design high&#8208;performance mid&#8208;infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, we have focused on the combination of a heavy metal lone pair cation, Pb 2+  and mixed oxyhalides. A systematic investigation in PbO&#8208;PbCl 2  &#8208;PbBr 2  system led us to discover the first examples of NLO lead mixed oxyhalides, namely, Pb 13  O 6  Cl 4  Br 10  , Pb 13  O 6  Cl 7  Br 7  , and Pb 13  O 6  Cl 9  Br 5  . All the reported materials have remarkably comprehensive properties including broad IR transparency (up to 14.0 &#956;  m), qualified second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (0.6&#8722;0.9 &#215; AgGaS 2  ), wide bandgaps (3.05&#8722;3.21 eV), and ease of crystal growth. Interestingly, a centimeter&#8208;sized single crystal (2.9 &#215; 1.3 &#215; 0.5 cm 3  ) of Pb 13  O 6  Cl 9  Br 5  revealing a wide transparent range (0.384&#8722;14.0 &#956;  m) and high laser damage threshold (LDT) (14.6 &#215; AgGaS 2  ) has been successfully grown in an open system. The study suggests that all the reported mixed oxyhalides are outstanding candidates for mid&#8208;IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Acids and Hydroxy Acids by Tandem Oxidation, Epoxidation, and Hydrolysis/Hydrogenation of Bioethanol Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible chemical platform is described for the conversion of bioethanol into three distinct specialty chemical building blocks at high yields: crotonic acid (i, 62&#8201;%), 3&#8208;hydroxy butanoic acid (ii, 29&#8201;%), and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyacid (iii, 21&#8201;%). The products can serve as basis for the production of numerous high&#8208;value chemicals.







Abstract
We report a reaction platform for the synthesis of three different high&#8208;value specialty chemical building blocks starting from bio&#8208;ethanol, which might have an important impact in the implementation of biorefineries. First, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde generates an aldehyde&#8208;containing stream active for the production of C4 aldehydes via base&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;condensation. Then, the resulting C4 adduct is selectively converted into crotonic acid via catalytic aerobic oxidation (62&#8201;% yield). Using a sequential epoxidation and hydrogenation of crotonic acid leads to 29&#8201;% yield of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acid (3&#8208;hydroxybutanoic acid). By controlling the pH of the reaction media, it is possible to hydrolyze the oxirane moiety leading to 21&#8201;% yield of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy acid (2,3&#8208;dihydroxybutanoic acid). Crotonic acid, 3&#8208;hydroxybutanoic acid, and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybutanoic acid are archetypal specialty chemicals used in the synthesis of polyvinyl&#8208;co&#8208;unsaturated acids resins, pharmaceutics, and bio&#8208;degradable/ &#8208;compatible polymers, respectively.

      <dc:description>
An enantioselective C2&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;substituted indoles is reported, providing C2&#8208;allylated products with excellent regiocontrol. Experimental studies and DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via direct C2&#8208;allylation with steric congestion at the indole&#8208;C3 position and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions identified as major contributors to the selectivity observed.







Abstract
The enantioselective intermolecular C2&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;substituted indoles is reported for the first time. This directing group&#8208;free approach relies on a chiral Ir&#8208;(P, olefin) complex and Mg(ClO4)2 Lewis acid catalyst system to promote allylic substitution, providing the C2&#8208;allylated products in typically high yields (40&#8211;99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (83&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) with excellent regiocontrol. Experimental studies and DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via direct C2&#8208;allylation, rather than C3&#8208;allylation followed by in situ migration. Steric congestion at the indole&#8208;C3 position and improved &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions have been identified as major contributors to the C2&#8208;selectivity.

Abstract
DNA encoded libraries (DEL) have shown promise as a valuable technology for democratizing the hit discovery process. Although DEL provides relatively inexpensive access to libraries of unprecedented size, their production has been hampered by the idiosyncratic needs of the encoding DNA tag relegating DEL compatible chemistry to dilute aqueous environments. Recently reversible adsorption to solid support (RASS) has been demonstrated as a promising method to expand DEL reactivity using standard organic synthesis protocols. Here we demonstrate a suite of on&#8208;DNA chemistries to incorporate medicinally relevant and C&#8722;S, C&#8722;P and N&#8722;S linkages into DELs, which are underrepresented in the canonical methods.

      <title>A Molecular Strategy to Lock&#8208;in the Conformation of a Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular polymers delivers a new class of robust, &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanoscale objects. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements elucidate the unique optoelectronic properties of this semiconducting superstructures.







Abstract
Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular assemblies provides a new avenue to regulate the (opto)electronic properties of robust nanoscale objects. In the present contribution, we show that the covalent tethering of a perylene bisimide (PBI)&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer with a molecular locker enables the formation of a locked superstructure equipped with emergent structure&#8211;function relationships. Experiments that exploit variable&#8208;temperature ground&#8208;state electronic absorption spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrate that the excitonic coupling between nearest neighboring units in the tethered superstructure is preserved at a temperature (371&#8197;K) where the pristine, non&#8208;covalent assembly exists exclusively in a molecularly dissolved state. A close examination of the solid&#8208;state morphologies reveals that the locked superstructure engenders the formation of hierarchical 1D materials which are not achievable by unlocked assemblies. To complement these structural attributes, we further demonstrate that covalently tethering a supramolecular polymer built from PBI subunits enables the emergence of electronic properties not evidenced in non&#8208;covalent assemblies. Using cyclic voltammetry experiments, the elucidation of the potentiometric properties of the locked superstructure reveals a 100&#8208;mV stabilization of the conduction band energy when compared to that recorded for the non&#8208;covalent assembly.

      <title>Molecular, Macromolecular, and Supramolecular Glucuronide Prodrugs: Lead Identified for Anticancer Prodrug Monotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Targeting tumors: Safe, tumor&#8208;accumulating prodrugs that are specific to the enzymatic repertoire of the tumor comprise an effective anticancer therapy. The lead structure could not be predicted by in vitro/ex vivo screens but was identified through in vivo monitoring.







Abstract
In this work, a tumor growth intervention by localized drug synthesis within the tumor volume, using the enzymatic repertoire of the tumor itself, is presented. Towards the overall success, molecular, macromolecular, and supramolecular glucuronide prodrugs were designed for a highly potent toxin, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The lead candidate exhibited a fold difference in toxicity between the prodrug and the drug of 175, had an engineered mechanism to enhance the deliverable payload to tumours, and contained a highly potent toxin such that bioconversion of only a few prodrug molecules created a concentration of MMAE sufficient enough for efficient suppression of tumor growth. Each of these points is highly significant and together afford a safe, selective anticancer measure, making tumor&#8208;targeted glucuronides attractive for translational medicine.

      <title>Chemo&#8208; and Magnetotaxis of Self&#8208;Propelled Light&#8208;Emitting Chemo&#8208;electronic Swimmers</title>
      <dc:description>
LED down the gradient path: Miniaturized autonomous swimmers follow chemical and magnetic field gradients with simultaneous light emission based on the integration of two redox reactions into a light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Miniaturized autonomous chemo&#8208;electronic swimmers, based on the coupling of spontaneous oxidation and reduction reactions at the two poles of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), are presented as chemotactic and magnetotactic devices. In homogeneous aqueous media, random motion caused by a bubble&#8208;induced propulsion mechanism is observed. However, in an inhomogeneous environment, the self&#8208;propelled devices exhibit positive chemotactic behavior, propelling themselves along a pH or ionic strength gradient (&#8711;pH and &#8711;I, respectively) in order to reach a thermodynamically higher active state. In addition, the intrinsic permanent magnetic moment of the LED allows self&#8208;orientation in the terrestrial magnetic field or following other external magnetic perturbations, which enables a directional motion control coupled with light emission. The interplay between chemotaxis and magnetotaxis allows fine&#8208;tuning of the dynamic behavior of these swimmers.

      <title>Crystals in Minutes: Instant On&#8208;Site Microcrystallisation of Various Flavours of the CYP102A1 (P450BM3) Haem Domain</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal Rain: Using microcrystals of CYP102A1 (P450BM3) bound to the crystallisation accelerator N&#8208;abietoyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan (AbiATrp) as nuclei in batch microseeding, a range of novel structures of the P450BM3 haem domain could be determined. These structures could be useful in the structure&#8208;based design of P450BM3 as a potent biocatalyst.







Abstract
Despite CYP102A1 (P450BM3) representing one of the most extensively researched metalloenzymes, crystallisation of its haem domain upon modification can be a challenge. Crystal structures are indispensable for the efficient structure&#8208;based design of P450BM3 as a biocatalyst. The abietane diterpenoid derivative N&#8208;abietoyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan (AbiATrp) is an outstanding crystallisation accelerator for the wild&#8208;type P450BM3 haem domain, with visible crystals forming within 2&#8197;hours and diffracting to a near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;. Using these crystals as seeds in a cross&#8208;microseeding approach, an assortment of P450BM3 haem domain crystal structures, containing previously uncrystallisable decoy molecules and diverse artificial metalloporphyrins binding various ligand molecules, as well as heavily tagged haem&#8208;domain variants, could be determined. Some of the structures reported herein could be used as models of different stages of the P450BM3 catalytic cycle.

Abstract
SuFEx reactions, in which an S&#8722;F moiety reacts with a silyl&#8208;protected phenol, have been developed as powerful click reactions. In the current paper we open up the potential of SuFEx reactions as enantioselective reactions, analyze the role of Si and outline the mechanism of this reaction. As a result, fast, high&#8208;yielding, &#8220;Si&#8208;free&#8221; and enantiospecific SuFEx reactions of sulfonimidoyl fluorides have been developed, and their mechanism shown, by both experimental and theoretical methods, to yield chiral products.

      <title>Deciphering Iron&#8208;Dependent Activity in Oxygen Evolution Catalyzed by Nickel&#8211;Iron Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron versus nickel: Turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyzed by a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been determined. Effects of structural disorder of NiOOH lattice are revealed.







Abstract
Nickel iron oxyhydroxide is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Whereas the presence of Fe ions is essential to the high activity, the functions of Fe are currently under debate. Using oxygen isotope labeling and operando Raman spectroscopic experiments, we obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites for a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are structurally defined samples of the corresponding oxyhydroxides. The Fe sites have TOFs 20&#8211;200 times higher than the Ni sites such that at an Fe content of 4.7&#8201;% and above the Fe sites dominate the catalysis. Higher Fe contents lead to larger structural disorder of the NiOOH host. A volcano&#8208;type correlation was found between the TOFs of Fe sites and the structural disorder of NiOOH. Our work elucidates the origin of the Fe&#8208;dependent activity of NiFe LDH, and suggests structural ordering as a strategy to improve OER catalysts.

      <title>Assembly of the Thiolated [Au1Ag22(S&#8208;Adm)12]3+ Superatom Complex into a Framework Material through Direct Linkage by SbF6&#8722; Anions</title>
      <dc:description>
A fresh framework: A new type of porous material, termed a SCIF (superatom complex inorganic framework), was constructed by linking Au1Ag22 superatom clusters with inorganic SbF6&#8722; (see picture). The obtained SCIF&#8208;1 and SCIF&#8208;2 materials exhibited unique fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence properties.







Abstract
Building framework materials with desirable properties and enhanced functionalities with nanocluster/superatom complexes as building blocks remains a challenge in the field of nanomaterials. In this study, the chiral [Au1Ag22(S&#8208;Adm)12]3+ nanocluster/superatom complex (SC, in which S&#8208;Adm=1&#8208;adamantanethiol) was employed as a building block to construct the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) superatom complex inorganic framework (SCIF) materials SCIF&#8208;1 and SCIF&#8208;2 through inorganic SbF6&#8722; linkers. SCIF&#8208;1 is racemic due to the assembly of two SC enantiomers in a single crystal. In SCIF&#8208;2, the SC enantiomers are packed in separate crystals, thus producing larger channels and a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. These two 3D SCIF materials exhibit unique sensitive photoluminescence (PL) in protic solvents. Our study provides a new pathway for creating novel open&#8208;framework materials with superatom complexes and a foundation for the further development of 3D framework materials for sensing and other applications.

Run and turn! With alternation between darkness and illumination, transition between nearly linear (&#8220;run&#8221;) and steering (&#8220;turn&#8221;) locomotion can be realized. Such composite locomotion is often found in biological activities like larval taxis.







Abstract
Active media that host spiral waves can display complex modes of locomotion driven by the dynamics of those waves. We use a model of a photosensitive stimulus&#8208;responsive gel that supports the propagation of spiral chemical waves to study locomotive transition and programmed locomotion. The mode transition between circular and toroidal locomotion results from the onset of spiral tip meandering that arises via a secondary Hopf bifurcation as the level of illumination is increased. This dynamic instability of the system introduces a second circular locomotion with a small diameter caused by tip meandering. The original circular locomotion with large diameter is driven by the push&#8208;pull asymmetry of the wavefront and waveback of the simple spiral waves initiated at one corner of gel. By harnessing this mode transition of the gel locomotion via coded illumination, we design programmable pathways of nature&#8208;inspired angular locomotion of the gel.

      <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective Acylation of Biaryl Phenols via Sequential Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Atropselective acylation of symmetric biaryl diols using isothiourea catalysis leads to chiral biaryls with high enantioselectivity. This process consists of two successive enantioselective reactions with an initial desymmetrization coupled with a chiroablative kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Axially chiral phenols are attractive targets in organic synthesis. This motif is central to many natural products and widely used as precursors to, or directly, as chiral ligands and catalysts. Despite their utility few simple catalytic methods are available for their synthesis in high enantiopurity. Herein the atropselective acylation of a range of symmetric biaryl diols is investigated using isothiourea catalysis. Studies on a model biaryl diol substrate shows that the high product er observed in the process is a result of two successive enantioselective reactions consisting of an initial enantioselective desymmetrization coupled with a second chiroablative kinetic resolution. Extension of this process to a range of substrates, including a challenging tetraorthosubstituted biaryl diol, led to highly enantioenriched products (14 examples, up to 98:2 er), with either HyperBTM or BTM identified as the optimal catalyst depending upon the substitution pattern within the substrate. Computation has been used to understand the factors that lead to high enantiocontrol in this process, with maintenance of planarity to maximize a 1,5&#8208;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction within the key acyl ammonium intermediate identified as the major feature that determines atropselective acylation and thus product enantioselectivity.

      <title>An Activatable AIEgen Probe for High&#8208;Fidelity Monitoring of Overexpressed Tumor Enzyme Activity and Its Application to Surgical Tumor Excision</title>
      <dc:description>
The cutting edge: An enzyme&#8208;activated two&#8208;photon AIEgen, DQM&#8208;ALP, for imaging the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in tumor cells and 3D tumor spheroids with high spatial resolution was synthesized. DQM&#8208;ALP enabled accurate differentiation between tumor and normal tissue ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo, suggesting that the probe may serve as a powerful tool to assist surgeons during tumor resection.







Abstract
Monitoring fluctuations in enzyme overexpression facilitates early tumor detection and excision. An AIEgen probe (DQM&#8208;ALP) for the imaging of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was synthesized. The probe consists of a quinoline&#8208;malononitrile (QM) core decorated with hydrophilic phosphate groups as ALP&#8208;recognition units. The rapid liberation of DQM&#8208;OH aggregates in the presence of ALP resulted in aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence. The up&#8208;regulation of ALP expression in tumor cells was imaged using DQM&#8208;ALP. The probe permeated into 3D cervical and liver tumor spheroids for imaging spatially heterogeneous ALP activity with high spatial resolution on a two&#8208;photon microscopy platform, providing the fluorescence&#8208;guided recognition of sub&#8208;millimeter tumorigenesis. DQM&#8208;ALP enabled differentiation between tumor and normal tissue ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo, suggesting that the probe may serve as a powerful tool to assist surgeons during tumor resection.

      <title>Capturing the Monomeric (L)CuH in NHC&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrin: Cavity&#8208;Controlled Chemoselective Hydrosilylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>
The law of cavity: Cavity&#8208;controlled chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones was observed inside NHC&#8208;capped cyclodextrins (ICyDs). The cavity features an elusive intermediate monomeric (L)CuH moiety.







Abstract
The encapsulation of copper inside a cyclodextrin capped with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (ICyD) allowed both to catch the elusive monomeric (L)CuH and a cavity&#8208;controlled chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Remarkably, (&#945;&#8208;ICyD)CuCl promoted the 1,2&#8208;addition exclusively, while (&#946;&#8208;ICyD)CuCl produced the fully reduced product. The chemoselectivity is controlled by the size of the cavity and weak interactions between the substrate and internal C&#8722;H bonds of the cyclodextrin.

      <title>Light&#8208;Induced Chiral Iron Copper Selenide Nanoparticles Prevent &#946;&#8208;Amyloidopathy In&#8197;Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
The right handedness: Chiral FexCuySe nanoparticles (NPs) that absorb in the range of 400&#8211;1000&#8197;nm have been prepared. The findings reveal that d&#8208;FexCuySe NPs have a high efficiency for protection against the neuronal damage induced by the deposition of A&#946;42 and alleviated the symptoms in mice with Alzheimer's disease to recover their cognitive competence.







Abstract
The accumulation and deposition of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) plaques in the brain is considered a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chiral l/d&#8208;FexCuySe nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated that interfer with the self&#8208;assembly of A&#946;42 monomers and trigger the A&#946;42 fibrils in dense structures to become looser monomers under 808&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. d&#8208;FexCuySe NPs have a much higher affinity for A&#946;42 fibrils than l&#8208;FexCuySe NPs and chiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs. The chiral FexCuySe NPs also generate more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than chiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs under NIR&#8208;light irradiation. In living MN9D cells, d&#8208;NPs attenuate the adhesion of A&#946;42 to membranes and neuron loss after NIR treatment within 10&#8197;min without the photothermal effect. In&#8208;vivo experiments showed that d&#8208;FexCuySe NPs provide an efficient protection against neuronal damage induced by the deposition of A&#946;42 and alleviate symptoms in a mouse model of AD, leading to the recovery of cognitive competence.
