      <title>The human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 is a nanomolar inhibitor of amyloid self&#8208;assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)</title>
      <dc:description>Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is linked to pancreatic inflammation, &#946;&#8208;cell degeneration, and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The multifunctional host defence peptides (HDPs) cathelicidins play crucial roles in inflammation. Here we show that the antimicrobial and immunomodu&#173;latory polypeptide human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 binds IAPP with nano&#173;molar affinity and effectively suppresses its amyloid self&#8208;assembly and related pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell damage in vitro. In addition, we identify key LL&#8208;37 segments mediating its interaction with IAPP. Our results suggest a possible protective role for LL&#8208;37 in T2D pathogenesis and offer a molecular basis for the design of LL&#8208;37&#8208;derived peptides combining antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and T2D&#8208;related anti&#8208;amyloid functions as promising candidates for multifunc&#173;tional drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Thioguanosine conversion enables mRNA life&#8208;time evaluation by RNA sequencing via double metabolic labeling</title>
      <dc:description>Temporal information about cellular RNA populations is essential to understand the functional roles of RNA. We have developed hydrazine/NH  4  Cl/OsO  4  &#8211;based conversion of 6&#8208;thioguanosine (6sG)&#8208; into A'&#8208;containing RNA, where A' constitutes a 6&#8208;hydrazino purine derivative. The A' nucleoside retains the Watson&#8208;Crick base pair mode as shown by crystal structure analysis of a short palindromic duplex and thermodynamic analysis of UV&#8208;melting profiles. We further demonstrate that A' is efficiently decoded as adenosine in primer extension assays and in RNA sequencing experiments. Because 6sG is applicable to metabolic labeling of freshly synthesized RNA and because the novel conversion chemistry is fully compatible with the conversion of the frequently applied metabolic label 4&#8208;thiouridine (4sU) into C, the combination of both modified nucleosides in dual labeling set&#8208;ups enables high accuracy measurements of RNA decay. Our novel approach that we name TUC&#8208;seq DUAL uses the two modified nucleotides in subsequent pulses and their simultaneous detection. Thus, synthesis and decay of mRNA can be clearly distinguished based on the differential presence of G&#8208;to&#8208;A and U&#8208;to&#8208;C mutations. This enables mRNA life&#8208;time evaluation with unprecedented precision.</dc:description>

      <title>Analysis of an active deformylation mechanism of 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) in stem cells</title>
      <dc:description>5&#8208;Methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC) is considered the fifth base of the genetic system. Its presence in promoter elements takes part in silencing the corresponding gene. Its removal, associated with the reactivation of silenced genes, is possible via an enigmatic active demethylation process that requires the oxidation of mdC to 5&#8209;hydroxymethyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (hmdC) and further on to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;deoxycytidine (cadC) with the help of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent Tet&#8208;oxygenases. The removal of mdC occurs at the level of the fdC and cadC oxidation state. One pathway involves the action of a dedicated glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome, allowing its replacement by dC. A second is proposed to involve C&#8208;C bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. While the TDG&#8208;induced repair&#8208;based pathway is well characterized, information about the C&#8208;C bond cleaving process is very limited. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel 6&#8208;aza&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (a&#8208;fdC) probe molecule, which was fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mESCs, together with a 2&#8217;&#8208;fluorinated fdC analog (F&#8208;fdC). While deformylation of F&#8208;fdC was clearly observed in vivo, it did not occur with a&#8208;fdC, suggesting that the C&#8208;C bond cleaving deformylation reaction must be initiated by a nucleophilic activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling gas selectivity in molecular porous liquids by tuning the cage window size</title>
      <dc:description>Control of pore window size is the standard approach for tuning gas selectivity in porous solids. Here, we present the first example where this is translated into a molecular porous liquid formed from organic cage molecules. Reduction of the cage window size by chemical synthesis switches the selectivity from Xe&#8208;selective to CH4&#8208;selective, which is understood using 129Xe, 1H, and pulsed&#8208;field gradient NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Despite the growing importance of volatile functionalized diazoalkanes in organic synthesis, their safe generation and utilization remain a formidable challenge due to their difficult handling along with storage and security issues. In this study, we developed a bench&#8208;stable difluoroacetaldehyde  N  &#8208;triftosylhydrazone (DFHZ&#8208;Tfs) as an operationally safe diazo surrogate that can in situ release two low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight diazoalkanes, diazoacetaldehyde (CHOCHN  2  ) or difluorodiazoethane (CF  2  HCHN  2  ), in a controlled fashion under specific conditions.

      <title>Synthesis of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Cyclic Peptides via Catalytic Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
An activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted oxidative cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the assembly of biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids was developed for the synthesis of arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.







Abstract
Biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides comprise an intriguing class of structurally diverse natural products with significant biological activity. Especially noteworthy are the antibiotics arylomycin and its synthetic analogue G0775, which exhibits potent activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Herein, we present a simple, flexible, and reliable strategy based on activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted catalytic oxidative coupling for assembling biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids. The synthetic approach was utilized for preparing a number of natural and unnatural biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides, including arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.

      <title>Self&#8208;Amplified Photodynamic Therapy through the 1O2&#8208;Mediated Internalization of Photosensitizers from a Ppa&#8208;Bearing Block Copolymer</title>
      <dc:description>
A self&#8208;amplifying photodynamic therapy (PDT) system, consisting of a 1O2&#8208;responsive block copolymer, enables the controlled release of photosensitizers in tumor cells. Under NIR&#8208;light irradiation, the photosensitizer, Ppa, is released from the nanoparticles by the 1O2&#8208;triggered cleavage of a vinyldithioether linkage. The free photosensitizer increases 1O2 generation, releasing more photosensitizer from the nanoparticle, enhancing the phototoxicity of PDT.







Abstract
Nanocarriers are employed to deliver photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) through the enhanced penetration and retention effect, but disadvantages including the premature leakage and non&#8208;selective release of photosensitizers still exist. Herein, we report a 1O2&#8208;responsive block copolymer (POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;P(MAA&#8208;co&#8208;VSPpaMA) to enhance PDT via the controllable release of photosensitizers. Once nanoparticles formed by the block copolymer have accumulated in a tumor and have been taken up by cancer cells, pyropheophorbide&#8197;a (Ppa) could be controllably released by singlet oxygen (1O2) generated by light irradiation, enhancing the photosensitization. This was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging. The 1O2&#8208;responsiveness of POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;P(MAA&#8208;co&#8208;VSPpaMA) block copolymer enabled the realization of self&#8208;amplified photodynamic therapy by the regulation of Ppa release using NIR illumination. This may provide a new insight into the design of precise PDT.

Herein, we report a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;responsive block copolymer (POEGMA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P(MAA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;VSPpaMA) to enhance PDT via the controllable release of photosensitizers. Once nanoparticles formed by the block copolymer have accumulated in a tumor and have been taken up by cancer cells, pyropheophorbide&#8197;a (Ppa) could be controllably released by singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generated by light irradiation, enhancing the photosensitization. This was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging. The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;responsiveness of POEGMA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P(MAA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;VSPpaMA) block copolymer enabled the realization of self&#8208;amplified photodynamic therapy by the regulation of Ppa release using NIR illumination. This may provide a new insight into the design of precise PDT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting the Small GTPase Superfamily through Their Regulatory Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
What a PAIN: Small GTPases have been notoriously difficult targets for small molecule and biologic therapeutics. This review explores the molecules targeting the GEF, GAP, and GDI GTPase regulatory proteins. It identifies issues in the chemical strategies, including PAINs motifs, insufficient potency, and lack of selectivity, whilst also providing thoughts on how this field will develop in the future.







Abstract
The Ras superfamily of small GTPases are guanine&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;dependent switches essential for numerous cellular processes. Mutations or dysregulation of these proteins are associated with many diseases, but unsuccessful attempts to target the small GTPases directly have resulted in them being classed as &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. The GTP&#8208;dependent signaling of these proteins is controlled by their regulators; guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), and in the Rho and Rab subfamilies, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). This review covers the recent small molecule and biologics strategies to target the small GTPases through their regulators. It seeks to critically re&#8208;evaluate recent chemical biology practice, such as the presence of PAINs motifs and the cell&#8208;based readout using compounds that are weakly potent or of unknown specificity. It highlights the vast scope of potential approaches for targeting the small GTPases in the future through their regulatory proteins.

      <title>Supramolecular Tuning Enables Selective Oxygen Reduction Catalyzed by Cobalt Porphyrins for Direct Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide
</title>
      <dc:description>
ORR inspiring: Incorporating cobalt porphyrins into a porous supramolecular cage structure isolates molecular active sites for selective electrochemical oxygen reduction, leading to direct electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide in neutral pH water.







Abstract
We report a supramolecular strategy for promoting the selective reduction of O2 for direct electrosynthesis of H2O2. We utilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (Co&#8208;TPP), an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst with highly variable product selectivity, as a building block to assemble the permanently porous supramolecular cage Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) bearing six Co&#8208;TPP subunits connected through twenty&#8208;four imine bonds. Reduction of these imine linkers to amines yields the more flexible cage Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6). Both Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) and Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6) cages produce 90&#8211;100&#8201;% H2O2 from electrochemical ORR catalysis in neutral pH water, whereas the Co&#8208;TPP monomer gives a 50&#8201;% mixture of H2O2 and H2O. Bimolecular pathways have been implicated in facilitating H2O formation, therefore, we attribute this high H2O2 selectivity to site isolation of the discrete molecular units in each supramolecule. The ability to control reaction selectivity in supramolecular structures beyond traditional host&#8211;guest interactions offers new opportunities for designing such architectures for a broader range of catalytic applications.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reaction of the secondary alkynyl(Mes*)PH phosphane 2 with the (Fmes)BH2&#8226;SMe2 reagent gives the geminal PH/BH frustrated Lewis pair 3. The P&#8208;H and the B&#8208;H functions are jointly used in the reduction of carbon monoxide under mild conditions to give the [P]&#8208;CH2&#8208;O&#8208;[B] product 11. A subsequent cycloaddition sequence results in the liberation of formaldehyde. The FLP 3 reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine, and it couples two isonitriles at the FLP framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Hierarchical Nanosized Single&#8208;Crystal Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves from Highly Homogeneous and Concentrated Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical nanosized single&#8208;crystal zeotypes: AEL&#8208;, AFI&#8208;, LTA&#8208;, and &#8208;CLO&#8208;type aluminophosphate molecular sieve nanocrystals with intracrystalline mesopores have been synthesized from highly homogeneous and concentrated precursors without growth modifiers and mesoporogens.







Abstract
The synthesis of hierarchical nanosized zeolite materials without growth modifiers and mesoporogens remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a general synthetic approach to produce hierarchical nanosized single&#8208;crystal aluminophosphate molecular sieves by preparing highly homogeneous and concentrated precursors and heating at elevated temperatures. Accordingly, aluminophosphate zeotypes of LTA (8&#8208;rings), AEL (10&#8208;rings), AFI (12&#8208;rings), and &#8208;CLO (20&#8208;rings) topologies, ranging from small to extra&#8208;large pores, were synthesized. These materials show exceptional properties, including small crystallites (30&#8211;150&#8197;nm), good monodispersity, abundant mesopores, and excellent thermal stability. A time&#8208;dependent study revealed a non&#8208;classical crystallization pathway by particle attachment. This work opens a new avenue for the development of hierarchical nanosized zeolite materials and understanding their crystallization mechanism.

      <title>Accurate Control of VS2 Nanosheets for Coexisting High Photoluminescence and Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional amorphous VS2 and partial crystallized 2D VO2(D) nanosheets are successfully fabricated using supercritical CO2. Full band absorption, strong photoluminescence, and outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency co&#8208;exist owing to the unique 2D amorphous structure.







Abstract
In two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous nanosheets, the electron&#8211;phonon coupling triggered by localization of the electronic state as well as multiple&#8208;scattering feature make it exhibit excellent performance in optical science. VS2 nanosheets, especially single&#8208;layer nanosheets with controllable electronic structure and intrinsic optical properties, have rarely been reported owing to the limited preparation methods. Now, a controllable and feasible switching method is used to fabricate 2D amorphous VS2 and partial crystallized 2D VO2(D) nanosheets by altering the pressure and temperature of supercritical CO2 precisely. Thanks to the strong carrier localization and the quantum confinement, the unique 2D amorphous structures exhibit full band absorption, strong photoluminescence, and outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency.

      <title>Reducing Detrimental Defects for High&#8208;Performance Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Watching the defects: Defects play a pivotal role in the overall performance of perovskite solar cells. In this review, we focus on central questions of &#8220;what defects exist in metal halide perovskites&#8221; and &#8220;how can one reduce detrimental defects aiming high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells&#8221;.







Abstract
In several photovoltaic (PV) technologies, the presence of electronic defects within the semiconductor band gap limit the efficiency, reproducibility, as well as lifetime. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have drawn great attention because of their excellent photovoltaic properties that can be achieved even without a very strict film&#8208;growth control processing. Much has been done theoretically in describing the different point defects in MHPs. Herein, we discuss the experimental challenges in thoroughly characterizing the defects in MHPs such as, experimental assignment of the type of defects, defects densities, and the energy positions within the band gap induced by these defects. The second topic of this Review is passivation strategies. Based on a literature survey, the different types of defects that are important to consider and need to be minimized are examined. A complete fundamental understanding of defect nature in MHPs is needed to further improve their optoelectronic functionalities.

Metathesis and condensation of P&#8722;N and P&#8722;P or P&#8722;H bonds are powerful strategies to access polyphosphanes. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201911483), J.&#8197;J.

Complexation studies with coinage metal salts hint at a rich coordination chemistry for such phosphorus&#8208;rich species.

Abstract
The preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized iridium nanoparticles and their application in hydrogen isotope exchange reactions is reported.

      <title>NMR Characterization of Surface Receptor Protein Interactions in Live Cells Using Methylcellulose Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
NMR gels with methylcellulose: NMR studies on proteins with living cells require careful control of cell integrity and viability. Methylcellulose hydrogels can be used to characterize the binding of extracellular proteins to cell&#8208;surface membrane receptors. The approach is easy to use, offers favorable properties to maintain 3D cell cultures, and will thus help to bridge the gap between in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo environments in drug discovery.







Abstract
Interactions of transmembrane receptors with their extracellular ligands are essential for cellular communication and signaling and are therefore a major focus in drug discovery programs. The transition from in&#8197;vitro to live cell interaction studies, however, is typically a bottleneck in many drug discovery projects due to the challenge of obtaining atomic&#8208;resolution information under near&#8208;physiological conditions. Although NMR spectroscopy is ideally suited to overcome this limitation, several experimental impairments are still present. Herein, we propose the use of methylcellulose hydrogels to study extracellular proteins and their interactions with plasma membrane receptors. This approach reduces cell sedimentation, prevents the internalization of membrane receptors, and increases cell survival, while retaining the free tumbling of extracellular proteins.

      <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide (V  2  C) MXene has shown great potential as a photothermal agent (PTA) for photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the use of V  2  C in PTT is limited by the harsh synthesis condition and low photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE). Herein, to address such an issue, we report a completely different green delamination method using algae extraction to intercalate and delaminate V  2  AlC to produce mass V  2  C nanosheets (NSs) with a high yield (90%). The resulting V  2  C NSs demonstrated good structural integrity and remarkably high absorption in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region with a PTCE as high as 48% under an 808&#8208;laser irradiation. It is superior to the previously reported MXene photothermal agents, including Mo  2  C (42.9%), Nb  2  C (36.4% at NIR&#8208;I and 45.65% at NIR&#8208;II), Ta  4  C  3  (44.7%), and even comparable to the cutting&#8208;edge photo absorption agents, such as gold&#8208;based materials, and carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. Systemic in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the V  2  C NSs severe as efficient PTA for photoacoustic (PA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided photothermal hyperthermia of cancer. This work provides a cost&#8208;effectively, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;yield disassembly approach of MAX, opening a new avenue to develop MXenes with desirable properties for a myriad of applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Surface atomic arrangement and coordination of photocatalysts highly exposed to different crystal facets significantly affect the photoreactivity. However, controversies on the true photoreactivity of a specific facet in heterogeneous photocatalysis still exits. Herein, we exemplified well&#8208;defined BiOBr nanosheets dominating with respective facets, (001) and (010), to track the reactivity of crystal facets for photocatalytic water splitting. The real photoreactivity of BiOBr&#8208;(001) were evidenced to be significantly higher than BiOBr&#8208;(010) for both hydrogen production and oxygen evolution reactions. Further in&#8208;situ photochemical probing studies verified the distinct reactivity is not only owing to the highly exposed facets, but dominantly determined by the co&#8208;exposing facets, making the spatial separation of photogenerated charges between top and lateral facets takes place efficiently. Such spatial charge separation renders the reduction and oxidation reactions separately to occur onto the dominate facet and the co&#8208;exposing facet with different reaction rates, which ordains the fate of the true photoreactivity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A novel Co(II)&#8208;catalyzed polyene cyclization was developed that is uniquely effective when performed in hexafluoroisopropanol as solvent.

Terpenoid scaffolds with different substitution patterns are obtained with excellent diastereoselectivities, and the bioactive C20&#8208;oxidized abietane diterpenoid carnosaldehyde was made to showcase the utility of the nitrile&#8208;bearing products.

      <title>Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates by Stereoselective Copolymerization of Racemic Diolides: Stereocontrol Mechanism and Polyolefin&#8208;Like Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of biodegradable polymers due to their biodegradability in ambient environments and structural diversity enabled by side&#8208;chain groups. However, the biosynthesis of PHAs is slow and expensive, limiting their broader applications as commodity plastics. To overcome such limitation, the catalyzed chemical synthesis of bacterial PHAs has been developed via the metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerization of racemic cyclic diolides (  rac&#8208;8DL  R  , R = alkyl group). In this combined experimental and computational study, polymerization kinetics, stereocontrol mechanism, copolymerization characteristics, and the resulting PHAs' properties have been examined. Most notably, stereoselective copolymerizations of&#160;    rac&#8208;8DL  Me   with&#160;     rac&#8208;8DL  R   (R = Et, Bu) have yielded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight, crystalline isotactic PHA copolymers that are hard, ductile, and tough plastics, and exhibit polyolefin&#8208;like thermal and mechanical properties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The rational construction of heterojunctions and design of photocatalyst structures are considered effective approaches to enhance photocatalytic activities. Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive hierarchical Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  tubular heterostructures are fabricated by growing two&#8208;dimensional ZnIn  2  S  4  nanosheets on one&#8208;dimensional hollow Co  9  S  8  nanotubes. This rational design combines two photoresponsive sulfide semiconductors in a stable heterojunction with a hierarchical hollow tubular structure, improving visible&#8208;light absorption, yielding a large surface area, exposing sufficient catalytically active sites, and effectively promoting the separation and migration of photogenerated charges. The as&#8208;prepared hierarchical Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  nanotubes thus exhibit excellent photocatalytic H  2  evolution and Cr(VI) reduction efficiency.

      <title>Controlling Metallophilic Interactions in Chiral Au(I) Double Salts towards Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (Ex&#8208;De PL) in the visible region have potential applications in bioimaging, optoelectronics and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, we report two multifunctional, chiral [Au(NHC)  2  ][Au(CN)  2  ] (NHC = (4R,5R)/(4S,5S)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) complex double salts that display Ex&#8208;De circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in doped polymer films and in ground powder state.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (Ex&#8208;De PL) in the visible region have potential applications in bioimaging, optoelectronics and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, we report two multifunctional, chiral [Au(NHC)  2  ][Au(CN)  2  ] (NHC = (4R,5R)/(4S,5S)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) complex double salts that display Ex&#8208;De circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in doped polymer films and in ground powder state. Their emission maxima can be dynamically tuned from 440 to 530 nm by changing the excitation wavelength. Through both experimental and theoretical studies, we propose that the continuously tunable photoluminescence originates from multiple emissive excited states as a result of the existence of varied Au(I)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(I) distances in ground state.

      <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives have been widely explored for various applications owing to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties. However, inherent shortcomings, such as the instability and self&#8208;quenching in physiological conditions, limit their biomedical applications. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a new type of hybrid porous coordination polymers assembled from metal ions/secondary building units (SBUs) and organic linkers, have gained increasing attention.

This review article summarizes important synthesis strategies for porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs including porphyrin@MOFs, porphyrinic MOFs and composite porphyrinic MOFs, and highlights recent achievements and progress in the field of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs for biomedical applications in tumor therapy and biosensing.

      <title>Dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes enabled by sodium benzenedithiolate&#8208;rich protection layer</title>
      <dc:description>Sodium metal is an ideal anode material for metal rechargeable batteries, owing to its high theoretical capacity (1166 mAh g&#8208;1), low cost, and earth&#8208;abundance. However, the dendritic growth upon Na plating, stemming from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, is a major and most notable problem. Here, we report that a sodium benzenedithiolate (PhS2Na2)&#8208;rich protection layer synthesized in situ on sodium by a facile methodology effectively prevents dendrite growth in the carbonate electrolyte, leading to a stabilized sodium metal electrodeposition for 400 cycles (800 h) of repeated plating/stripping at a current density of 1mA cm&#8208;2. The organic salt, PhS2Na2, is found to be a critical component in the protection layer, and is different from traditional inorganic salts.

      <title>In&#8208;Depth TEM Investigation on Structural Inhomogeneity within a Primary LixNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 Particle: Origin of Capacity Decay during High&#8208;Rate Discharge</title>
      <dc:description>
Origin of capacity decay: Structural evolutions within a primary LiNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 (NCA83) particle, as a cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries, were investigated during various electrochemical processes using TEM. Significant reduction in the electrochemical capacity of NCA83 in the second charge is correlated with the development of nano&#8208;scale and micro&#8208;scale structural inversions.







Abstract
The structural stability of cathode materials during electrochemical reactions, in particular, under high&#8208;rate discharge, is pertinent to the design and development of new electrode materials. This study investigates the structural inhomogeneity that develops within a single LiNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 (NCA83) particle during a fast discharging process under different cutoff voltages. Some of the NCA83 particles discharged from a high cutoff voltage (4.8&#8197;V) developed surface areas in which the layered structure was recovered, although the interiors retained the degraded spinel structure. These micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale structural inversions from high cutoff voltage seem highly correlated with structural evolutions in the initial charged state, and may ultimately degrade the cycling stability. This study advances understanding of the structural inhomogeneity within primary particles during various electrochemical processes and may facilitate the development of new Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Origin of capacity decay&lt;/b&gt;: Structural evolutions within a primary LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.835&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.015&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCA83) particle, as a cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries, were investigated during various electrochemical processes using TEM. Significant reduction in the electrochemical capacity of NCA83 in the second charge is correlated with the development of nano&#8208;scale and micro&#8208;scale structural inversions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural stability of cathode materials during electrochemical reactions, in particular, under high&#8208;rate discharge, is pertinent to the design and development of new electrode materials. This study investigates the structural inhomogeneity that develops within a single LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.835&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.015&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCA83) particle during a fast discharging process under different cutoff voltages. Some of the NCA83 particles discharged from a high cutoff voltage (4.8&#8197;V) developed surface areas in which the layered structure was recovered, although the interiors retained the degraded spinel structure. These micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale structural inversions from high cutoff voltage seem highly correlated with structural evolutions in the initial charged state, and may ultimately degrade the cycling stability. This study advances understanding of the structural inhomogeneity within primary particles during various electrochemical processes and may facilitate the development of new Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In&#8197;Vivo Solid&#8208;Phase Microextraction for Sampling of Oxylipins in Brain of Awake, Moving Rats</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible in&#8197;vivo solid&#8208;phase microextraction was used to measure 52 eicosanoids and other oxylipins directly in brains of awake moving rats with high temporal and spatial resolution. In&#8197;vivo profiles of extracellular brain fluid did not reflect oxylipin concentrations in post&#8208;mortem tissue and provide a novel tool to elucidate oxylipin pathways and function.







Abstract
Oxylipins are key lipid mediators of important brain processes, including pain, sleep, oxidative stress, and inflammation. For the first time, an in&#8208;depth profile of up to 52 oxylipins can be obtained from the brains of awake moving animals using in&#8197;vivo solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) chemical biopsy tool in combination with liquid chromatography&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry. Among these, 23 oxylipins are detectable in the majority of healthy wildtype samples. This new approach successfully eliminates the changes in oxylipin concentrations routinely observed during the analysis of post&#8208;mortem samples, allows time&#8208;course monitoring of their concentrations with high spatial resolution in specific brain regions of interest, and can be performed using the same experimental set&#8208;up as in&#8197;vivo microdialysis (MD) thus providing a new and exciting tool in neuroscience and drug discovery.

      <title>Inside Back Cover: Tracking Pathogen Infections by Time&#8208;Resolved Chemical Proteomics (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 6/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics strategy is used to implant a &#8220;GPS device&#8221; on bacteria to track their location and interacting proteins. This strategy, reported by W.&#8197;A. Tao, Y. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;2235, involves labeling the living bacteria with a photoreactive linker and a biotin group for the isolation and analysis of crosslinked proteins by mass spectrometry at designated time points during the bacterial infection.

      <title>The Chemistry, Biology, and Modulation of Ammonium Nitrification in Soil</title>
      <dc:description>
The low efficiency of ammonium fertilizers used in agriculture contributes to significant environmental issues and economic losses. This Review discusses the chemistry and enzymatic mechanisms of microbial nitrification in the soil and highlights phytochemicals which can act as nitrification inhibitors, thus providing opportunities to stabilize ammonium in farm soils to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use.







Abstract
Approximately two percent of the world's energy is consumed in the production of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gas. Ammonia is used as a fertilizer ingredient for agriculture and distributed in the environment on an enormous scale to promote crop growth in intensive farming. Only 30&#8211;50&#8201;% of the nitrogen applied is assimilated by crop plants; the remaining 50&#8211;70&#8201;% goes into biological processes such as nitrification by microbial metabolism in the soil. This leads to an imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle and higher nitrous oxide emissions (a potent and significant greenhouse gas) as well as contamination of ground and surface waters by nitrate from the nitrogen&#8208;fertilized farmland. This Review gives a critical overview of the current knowledge of soil microbes involved in the chemistry of ammonia nitrification, the structures and mechanisms of the enzymes involved, and phytochemicals capable of inhibiting ammonia nitrification.

Abstract
[2.2]Paracyclophane (PCP) is a prevalent scaffold that is widely utilized in asymmetric synthesis, &#960;&#8208;stacked polymers, energy materials, and functional parylene coatings that finds broad applications in bio&#8208; and materials science. In the last few years, [2.2]paracyclophane chemistry has progressed tremendously, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of its structural and functional properties. This Minireview highlights the most important recent synthetic developments in the selective functionalization of PCP that govern distinct features of planar chirality as well as chiroptical and optoelectronic properties. Special focus is given to the function&#8208;inspired design of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;stacked conjugated materials by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Current synthetic challenges, limitations, as well as future research directions and new avenues for advancing cyclophane chemistry are also summarized.

      <title>Reshaping of Metal Nanoparticles Under Reaction Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting into shape: This Minireview gives a summary of the latest progress in characterizing and modeling the equilibrium shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in reactive environments through the combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) experiments and the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model.







Abstract
The shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is one of the key factors determining their catalytic reactivity. Recent in&#8197;situ TEM observations show that dynamic reshaping of metal NPs occurs under the reaction conditions, which becomes a major hurdle for fully understanding catalytic mechanisms at the molecular level. This Minireview provides a summary of the latest progress in characterizing and modeling the equilibrium shape of metal NPs in various reactive environments through the joint effort of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy experiments and a newly developed multiscale structure reconstruction model. The quantitative agreement between the experimental observations and theoretical modeling demonstrate that the fundamental mechanism of the reshaping phenomenon is driven by anisotropically changed surface energies under gas adsorption. The predictable reshaping of metal NPs paves the way for the rational design of truly efficient nanocatalysts in real reactions.

Abstract
In chemistry and other sciences, hype has become commonplace, compounded by the hypocrisy of those who tolerate or encourage it while disapproving of the consequences. This reduces the credibility and trust upon which all science depends for support. Hype and hypocrisy are but first steps down a slippery slope towards falsification of results and dissemination of fake science. Systemic drivers in the contemporary structure of the science establishment encourage exaggeration and may lure the individual into further steps along the hype&#8208;hypocrisy&#8208;falsification&#8208;fakery continuum. Collective, concerted intervention is required to effectively discourage entry to this dangerous pathway and to restore and protect the probity and reputation of the science system. Chemists must play and active role in this effort.

      <title>Imparting Multifunctionality by Utilizing Biporosity in a Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
The biporous nature of UiO&#8208;66 is utilized to incorporate conducting polymer moieties into the voids of the metal&#8211;organic framework. In this way the resulting nanocomposites display significant porosity and simultaneous million&#8208;fold enhancement in electrical conductivity along with ultralow thermal conductivity.







Abstract
In this work, we have synthesized nanocomposites made up of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and conducting polymers by polymerization of specialty monomers such as pyrrole (Py) and 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the voids of a stable and biporous Zr&#8208;based MOF (UiO&#8208;66). FTIR and Raman data confirmed the presence of polypyrrole (PPy) and poly3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PPy and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PEDOT nanocomposites, respectively, and PXRD data revealed successful retention of the structure of the MOF. HRTEM images showed successful incorporation of polymer fibers inside the voids of the framework. Owing to the intrinsic biporosity of UiO&#8208;66, polymer chains were observed to selectively occupy only one of the voids. This resulted in a remarkable enhancement (million&#8208;fold) of the electrical conductivity while the nanocomposites retain 60&#8211;70&#8201;% of the porosity of the original MOF. These semiconducting yet significantly porous MOF nanocomposite systems exhibited ultralow thermal conductivity. Enhanced electrical conductivity with lowered thermal conductivity could qualify such MOF nanocomposites for thermoelectric applications.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we have synthesized nanocomposites made up of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and conducting polymers by polymerization of specialty monomers such as pyrrole (Py) and 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the voids of a stable and biporous Zr&#8208;based MOF (&lt;b&gt;UiO&#8208;66&lt;/b&gt;). FTIR and Raman data confirmed the presence of polypyrrole (&lt;b&gt;PPy&lt;/b&gt;) and poly3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (&lt;b&gt;PEDOT&lt;/b&gt;) in &lt;b&gt;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PPy&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PEDOT&lt;/b&gt; nanocomposites, respectively, and PXRD data revealed successful retention of the structure of the MOF. HRTEM images showed successful incorporation of polymer fibers inside the voids of the framework. Owing to the intrinsic biporosity of &lt;b&gt;UiO&#8208;66&lt;/b&gt;, polymer chains were observed to selectively occupy only one of the voids. This resulted in a remarkable enhancement (million&#8208;fold) of the electrical conductivity while the nanocomposites retain 60&#8211;70&#8201;% of the porosity of the original MOF. These semiconducting yet significantly porous MOF nanocomposite systems exhibited ultralow thermal conductivity. Enhanced electrical conductivity with lowered thermal conductivity could qualify such MOF nanocomposites for thermoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flexible Total Synthesis of 11&#8208;Deoxylandomycins and Their Non&#8208;Natural Analogues by Way of Asymmetric Metal Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A collective total synthesis of 11&#8208; deoxylandomycins is reported using Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of alkoxyallene as the key strategy. This de novo approach allowed for an access to various natural and non&#8208;natural congeners of 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins.







Abstract
A de novo first collective total synthesis of 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins is reported. A signature step is featured by the Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of alcohol to ene&#8208;alkoxyallenes that assembles oligomeric 2,3,6&#8208;trideoxyoligosaccharides. The unique feature of the protocol is illustrated by a flexible access to various natural 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.

      <dc:description>As a kind of photoluminescent materials, Cu(I) complexes have many advantages such as adjustable emission, variable structures and low cost, attracting attention in many fields. In this work, two novel two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I)&#8208;NHC complexes were synthesized, exhibiting unique dual&#8208;emissive property from fluorescence and phosphorescence.

Based on this emissive mechanism, ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with a lifetime of 140 ms is achieved by selective deuteration of the carbazole group. These results deepen the understanding of the luminescent mechanism and design strategy in two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes, and prove their potential application as ultralong RTP materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Rapid, High&#8208;Contrast Visualization of Folate&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Expressing Tumors in Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Folate receptors (FRs) are membrane proteins involved in folic acid uptake, and the alpha isoform (FR&#8208;a) is overexpressed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. For fluorescence imaging of FRs in vivo, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (650&#8211;900 nm), where tissue penetration is high and autofluorescence is low, is optimal, but existing NIR fluorescent probes targeting FR&#8208;a show high non&#8208;specific tissue adsorption, and require prolonged washout to visualize tumors. We have designed and synthesized a new NIR fluorescent probe, FolateSiR&#8208;1, utilizing a Si&#8208;rhodamine fluorophore having a carboxy group at the benzene moiety, coupled to a folate ligand moiety via a negatively charged tripeptide linker. This probe exhibits very low background fluorescence, and afforded a tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) of up to 83 in FR&#8208;expressing tumor&#8208;bearing mice within 30 min. Thus, FolateSiR&#8208;1 has the potential to contribute to the research in the field of biology and the clinical medicine.</dc:description>

      <title>A Molecular Strategy to Lock&#8208;in the Conformation of a Perylene bisimide&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular assemblies provides a new avenue to regulate the (opto)electronic properties of robust nanoscale objects. In the present contribution, we show that the covalent tethering of a perylene bisimide (PBI)&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer with a molecular locker enables the formation of a locked superstructure equipped with emergent structure&#8208;function relationships. Experiments that exploit variable&#8208;temperature ground&#8208;state electronic absorption spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrate that the excitonic coupling between nearest neighboring units in the tethered superstructure is preserved at a temperature (371 K) where the pristine, non&#8208;covalent assembly exists exclusively in a molecularly dissolved state. A close examination of the solid&#8208;state morphologies reveals that the locked superstructure engenders the formation of hierarchical 1D materials which are not achievable by unlocked assemblies. To complement these structural attributes, we further demonstrate that covalently tethering a supramolecular polymer built from PBI subunits enables the emergence of electronic properties not evidenced in non&#8208;covalent assemblies. Using cyclic voltammetry experiments, the elucidation of the potentiometric properties of the locked superstructure reveals a 100&#8208;mV stabilization of the conduction band energy when compared to that recorded for a non&#8208;covalent assembly.</dc:description>

Experiments that exploit variable&#8208;temperature ground&#8208;state electronic absorption spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrate that the excitonic coupling between nearest neighboring units in the tethered superstructure is preserved at a temperature (371 K) where the pristine, non&#8208;covalent assembly exists exclusively in a molecularly dissolved state. A close examination of the solid&#8208;state morphologies reveals that the locked superstructure engenders the formation of hierarchical 1D materials which are not achievable by unlocked assemblies. To complement these structural attributes, we further demonstrate that covalently tethering a supramolecular polymer built from PBI subunits enables the emergence of electronic properties not evidenced in non&#8208;covalent assemblies. Using cyclic voltammetry experiments, the elucidation of the potentiometric properties of the locked superstructure reveals a 100&#8208;mV stabilization of the conduction band energy when compared to that recorded for a non&#8208;covalent assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;C Single Bond Cleavage: Making the Cut in Total Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C single bond cleavage can enable entirely new retrosynthetic disconnections in natural product total synthesis. Given that C&#8211;C bond cleavage inherently alters the carbon framework of a compound, and that, under transition metal catalysis, the generated organometallic or radical intermediate is primed for further complexity&#8208;building reactivity, C&#8211;C bond cleavage events have the potential to drastically and rapidly remodel skeletal frameworks. The recent acceleration in the use of transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C single bond cleavage in total synthesis can be ascribed to a communal recognition of this fact. In this Review, we highlight ten selected total syntheses from 2014&#8211;2019 that illustrate how transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C single bond cleavage on either the core or the periphery of synthetic intermediates can streamline synthetic efforts</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low Pressure Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Separations</title>
      <dc:description>The resurgence of interest in the hydrogen economy could hinge on the distribution of hydrogen in a safe and efficient manner. Whilst great progress has been made with cryogenic hydrogen storage or liquefied ammonia, Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) remain attractive due to their lack of need for cryogenic temperatures or high pressures, most commonly a cycle between methylcyclohexane and toluene. Oxidation of methylcyclohexane to release hydrogen will be more efficient if the equilibrium limitations can be removed by separating the mixture. This report describes a family of six ternary and quaternary multicomponent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that contain the three&#8208;dimensional cubane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (cdc) ligand. Of these MOFs, the most promising is a quaternary MOF (CUB&#8208;30), comprising cdc, 4,4'&#8208;biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdc) and tritopic truxene linkers. Contrary to conventional wisdom that adsorptive interactions with larger, hydrocarbon guests are dominated by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, here we report that contoured aliphatic pore environments can exhibit high selectivity and capacity for LOHC separations at low pressures. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, where selective adsorption for cyclohexane over benzene is witnessed, underlining the unique adsorptive behavior afforded by the unconventional cubane moiety.</dc:description>

      <title>A Sequential Dual&#8208;Lock Strategy for Photoactivatable Chemiluminescent Probes Enabling Bright Duplex Optical Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;based technologies have revolutionized in&#8208;vivo monitoring of biomolecules. However, significant technical hurdles in probe chemistry have limited the achievement of trigger&#8208;controlled, bright and enriched CL signal. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;lock strategy by sequence&#8208;dependent triggers for bright optical imaging with the integration of real&#8208;time fluorescent signal and ultra&#8208;sensitive CL signal. These probes can obtain an analyte&#8208;triggered accumulation of stable pre&#8208;chemiluminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and then the pre&#8208;chemiluminophore exhibits a rapid photooxidation process (1,2&#8208;dioxetane generation) by TICT&#8208;based free&#8208;radical addition, thereby achieving an enrichment and bright CL signal. The dual&#8208;lock strategy expands the in vivo toolbox for highly accurate analysis, and has for the first time allowed access to accurately sense and trace biomolecules with high&#8208;resolution, dual&#8208;mode of chemo&#8208;fluoro&#8208;luminescence, and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging in living animals.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable pyrrole&#8208;linked bioconjugates through tetrazine&#8208;triggered azanorbornadiene fragmentation</title>
      <dc:description>We have developed an azanorbornadiene bromovinyl sulfone reagent that allows cysteine&#8208;selective bioconjugation. Subsequent reaction with&#160; dipyridyl tetrazine&#160;led to bond&#8208;cleavage and formation of a pyrrole&#8208;linked conjugate. The latter involves ligation of the tetrazine to the azanorbornadiene&#8208;tagged protein through&#160; inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition &#160;with subsequent double&#160;  retro  &#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to form a stable pyrrole linkage. The sequence of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation followed by bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage was efficiently employed for the labelling of three different proteins. This method benefits from easy preparation of these reagents, selectivity for cysteine, and stability after reaction with a commercial tetrazine, which lends it to the routine preparation of protein conjugates for chemical biology studies.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have developed an azanorbornadiene bromovinyl sulfone reagent that allows cysteine&#8208;selective bioconjugation. Subsequent reaction with&#160; dipyridyl tetrazine&#160;led to bond&#8208;cleavage and formation of a pyrrole&#8208;linked conjugate. The latter involves ligation of the tetrazine to the azanorbornadiene&#8208;tagged protein through&#160; inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition &#160;with subsequent double&#160;  retro  &#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to form a stable pyrrole linkage. The sequence of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation followed by bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage was efficiently employed for the labelling of three different proteins. This method benefits from easy preparation of these reagents, selectivity for cysteine, and stability after reaction with a commercial tetrazine, which lends it to the routine preparation of protein conjugates for chemical biology studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Environment&#8208;Recognizing DNA Computation Circuit&#8208;Controlled Intracellular Transport of Molecular Payloads for mRNA Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Programming intelligent DNA nanocarriers for targeted transport of molecular payloads (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides) in living cells has attracted extensive attentions. In vivo  activation of these nanocarriers usually relies on external light irradiation. An emerging interest is to enable them to automatically recognize the intracellular surroundings and thereby be activated in situ  under the logic control of programmed DNA computation circuits. Towards this goal, here we integrate DNA computation circuits with framework nucleic acid (FNA) nanocarriers that consist of a truncated square pyramid (TSP) cage and a built&#8208;in duplex cargo containing an antisense strand of the target mRNA. An i&#8208;motif and ATP aptamer embedded in TSP are employed as logic controlling units to respond to endogenous proton and ATP inside subcellular compartments, triggering the release of the sensing element for fluorescent mRNA imaging. Given the abnormal levels of extra&#8208;/intracellular pH and ATP in tumor tissues, our logic&#8208;controlled FNA devices are of benefit to target drug delivery and precise disease treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>High ethylene selectivity in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction over MOR nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Precisely controlled crystal growth endows zeolites with special textural and catalytic properties. A nanosheet mordenite zeolite with a thickness of ~11 nm, named as MOR&#8208;NS, has been prepared using a well&#8208;designed gemini&#8208;type amphiphilic surfactant as bifunctional structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA).

The thin MOR nanosheets, with highly exposed (010) planes and 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) windows therein, exhibited an extremely higher ethylene selectivity (42.1%) for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin reactions when compared with conventional bulk MOR crystals (3.3%).

      <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective Acylation of Biaryl Phenols via Sequential Desymmetrization / Kinetic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral phenols are attractive targets in organic synthesis. This motif is central to many natural products and widely used as precursors to, or directly, as chiral ligands and catalysts. Despite their utility few simple catalytic methods are available for their synthesis in high enantiopurity. Herein the atropselective acylation of a range of symmetric biaryl diols is investigated using isothiourea catalysis. Studies on a model biaryl diol substrate shows that the high product er observed in the process is a result of two successive enantioselective reactions consisting of an initial enantioselective desymmetrization coupled with a second chiroablative kinetic resolution. Extension of this process to a range of substrates, including a challenging tetraorthosubstituted biaryl diol, led to highly enantioenriched products (14 examples, up to 98:2 er), with either HyperBTM or BTM identified as the optimal catalyst depending upon the substitution pattern within the substrate. Computation has been used to understand the factors that lead to high enantiocontrol in this process, with maintenance of planarity to maximize a 1,5&#8208;S&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O interaction within the key acyl ammonium intermediate identified as the major feature that determines atropselective acylation and thus product enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Specific Binding of a D&#8208;RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure with an L&#8208;RNA Aptamer</title>
      <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures are of general importance in chemistry and biology, such as biosensing, gene regulation, and cancers. Although a large repertoire of G4&#8208;binding tools has been developed, there is so far no aptamer being developed to interact with G4. Moreover, the G4 selectivity of current toolkits is very limited. Herein, we report the first L&#8208;RNA aptamer that targets D&#8208;RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4). Using  TERRA  rG4 as an example, our results reveal that this new L&#8208;RNA aptamer, Ap3&#8208;7, folds into a unique secondary structure, exhibits high G4 selectivity and interferes with  TERRA  rG4&#8208;RHAU53 binding effectively. Our novel approach and findings open up a new door in further developing G4&#8208;specific tools for diverse applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures are of general importance in chemistry and biology, such as biosensing, gene regulation, and cancers. Although a large repertoire of G4&#8208;binding tools has been developed, there is so far no aptamer being developed to interact with G4. Moreover, the G4 selectivity of current toolkits is very limited. Herein, we report the first L&#8208;RNA aptamer that targets D&#8208;RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4). Using  TERRA  rG4 as an example, our results reveal that this new L&#8208;RNA aptamer, Ap3&#8208;7, folds into a unique secondary structure, exhibits high G4 selectivity and interferes with  TERRA  rG4&#8208;RHAU53 binding effectively. Our novel approach and findings open up a new door in further developing G4&#8208;specific tools for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A nano&#8208;shield design for separators to resist dendrites of lithium metal battery</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium metal anodes are among the most promising candidates for high energy density batteries. However, the long&#8208;standing issue of lithium dendrites growth during repeated charge and discharge cycles, which often leads to short circuit by puncturing the porous separator, impedes its practical application. Here, inspired by the defensive armor shield, we provide a morphological design &#8220;nano&#8208;shield&#8221; for separators to resist dendrites. Through both mechanical analysis and experiment, it is revealed that the separator protected by this nano&#8208;shield can effectively inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrites by reducing stress intensity and providing high tortuosity , a nd therefore mitigate the short circuit of Li metal batteries. More than 110 h of lithium plating life is achieved in Li/Li cell tests, which is among the longest cycle life of lithium metal anode and five times longer than that of blank separators. This new aspect of morphological and mechanical design combining both theoretical understanding and experimental results not only provides an alternative pathway for extending lifetime of lithium metal anodes, but also sheds a light on the role of separator engineering for various electrochemical energy storage devices .</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of oxocarbenium ions: a case of ionic hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to the classic &#8220;inner&#8208;sphere&#8221; transition metal catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation reactions, ionic hydrogenation has been a far less explored area.

Kinetic studies suggested 1st&#8208;order kinetics in the substrate and half&#8208;order kinetics in the catalyst. A positive nonlinear effect, together with the half kinetic order, revealed a dimerization off the catalytic cycle.

      <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;induced Hyperpolarization of Gases</title>
      <dc:description>Imaging of gases is a major challenge for any modality including MRI. NMR and MRI signals are directly proportional to the nuclear spin density and the degree of alignment of nuclear spins with applied static magnetic field, which is called nuclear spin polarization. The level of nuclear spin polarization is typically very low,  i.e  ., one hundred thousandth of the potential maximum at 1.5 T and a physiologically relevant temperature. As a result, MRI typically focusses on imaging highly concentrated tissue water. Hyperpolarization methods transiently increases nuclear spin polarizations up to unity, yielding corresponding gains in MRI signal level of several orders of magnitude that enable the 3D imaging of dilute biomolecules including gases. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a fast, highly scalable, and low&#8208;cost hyperpolarization technique. The focus of this Minireview is to highlight selected advances in the field of parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization for the production of hyperpolarized compounds, which can be potentially employed as inhalable contrast agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid, label&#8208;free optical spectroscopy platform for diagnosis of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we propose the use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to determine spectral markers that can aid in the recognition of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;diagnose immune&#8208;related complication that often leads to limb ischemia and thromboembolism . The ability to produce distinct molecular signatures without requiring addition of exogenous labels enables unbiased inquiry and makes SERS an attractive complementary diagnostic tool for various complex pathologies. Specifically, we have designed a new plasmonic capillary flow platform that offers ultrasensitive , label&#8208;free measurement capability as well as efficient handling of blood serum samples. The optimized capillary channel shows excellent reproducibility and long&#8208;term stability and, crucially, provides an alternative diagnostic rubric for determination of HIT by leveraging machine&#8208;learning based classification of the spectroscopic data. With further refinement, we envision that a portable Raman instrument could be combined with the capillary&#8208;based SERS analytical tool for rapid, non&#8208;destructive determination of HIT in the clinical laboratory, without perturbing the existing diagnostic workflow.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Iron&#8208;Nickel Nanoparticles for Magnetically&#8208;Induced CO2 Methanation in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>Induction heating of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) has been recently explored as a new methodology to activate heterogeneous catalytic reactions. This approach requires the design and the synthesis of nano&#8208;objects displaying both a high heating power and an excellent catalytic activity. Here, using a surface engineering approach, we report for the first time the use of bimetallic NPs for magnetically&#8208;induced CO2 methanation which acts both as heating agent and as catalyst. Thus, we describe the organometallic synthesis of Fe30Ni70 NPs, displaying high heating powers at low magnetic field amplitudes. These NPs are active but only slightly selective for CH4 after deposition on SirAlOx due to the presence of an iron rich shell (25 mL&#183;min&#8208;1, 25 mT, 300 kHz, conversion 71%, methane selectivity 65%). Remarkably, a proper surface engineering consisting in depositing a thin Ni layer leads to Fe30Ni70@Ni NPs displaying a very high activity for CO2 hydrogenation and a full selectivity. For the first time, a quantitative yield in methane is obtained at low magnetic field and mild conditions (25 mL&#183;min&#8208;1, 19 mT, 300 kHz, conversion 100%, methane selectivity 100%).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Controlling reaction selectivity is a permanent pursuit for chemists. In particular, regio&#8208;selective catalysis, which exploits and/or overcomes innate steric and electronic bias to deliver diverse regio&#8208;enriched products from the same starting materials, represents a powerful tool for divergent synthesis. Recently,  our group reported the 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with simple hydrazones to generate branched allylic compounds when a nickel catalyst was used. As part of the effort, herein we show that a complete switch of Markovnikov to anti&#8208;Markovnikov directionality is obtained by slightly changing to a ruthenium catalyst, thus providing a direct and efficient access to the homoallylic products exclusively.  Isotopic substitution experiments indicate that no reversible hydro&#8208;metallation across the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl system occurred under ruthenium catalysis.
