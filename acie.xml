      <title>Facile and Versatile Synthesis of End&#8208;Functionalized Poly(phenylacetylene)s: A Multicomponent Catalytic System for Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes</title>
      <dc:description>
All's well that ends well: Various end&#8208;functionalized poly(phenylacetylene)s have been synthesized by polymerization using a multicomponent catalytic system composed of readily available and bench&#8208;stable reagents (see picture). Owing to the high reactivity and living nature of the polymerization, which has a high initiation efficiency (IE), the molecular weight of the obtained poly(phenylacetylene)s could be readily controlled with a very narrow polydispersity index (PDI).







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system for well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of phenylacetylenes has been developed. The catalytic system is composed of readily available and bench&#8208;stable [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, aryl boronic acid derivatives, diphenylacetylene, 50&#8201;% aqueous KOH, and PPh3. This system offers a method for the facile and versatile synthesis of various end&#8208;functionalized cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s because components from aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylene were introduced to the initiating end of the polymers. The polymerization reaction shows a typical living nature with a high initiation efficiency, and the molecular weight of the resulting poly(phenylacetylene)s can be readily controlled with very narrow molecular&#8208;weight distributions (Mw/Mn=1.02&#8211;1.09). The experimental results suggest that the present catalytic system has a higher polymerization activity than the polymerization activities of other rhodium&#8208;based catalytic systems previously reported.

      <title>Imino&#8208; and azasugar protonation inside human acid &#946;&#8208;glucosidase, the enzyme defective in Gaucher disease</title>
      <dc:description>Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in human acid &#946;&#8208;glucosidase, the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of glucosyl ceramide in the lysosomes. Imino&#8208; and azasugars such as 1&#8208;deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine are strong inhibitors of the enzyme and of interest in pharmacological chaperone therapy of the disease. Despite several crystal structures of the enzyme with the imino&#8208; and azasugars bound in the active site having been resolved, the actual acid&#8208;base chemistry of the binding is not known. In this study we show, using photoinduced electron transfer (PET), that 1&#8208;deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine derivatives are protonated by human acid &#946;&#8208;glucosidase when bound even if completely unprotonated outside the enzyme. While isofagomine derivative protonation to some degree was foreshadowed by earlier crystal structures, 1&#8208;deoxynojirimycin derivatives were not believed to act as basic amines in the enzyme.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8722;B Bond Nucleophilicity in a Tetraaryl &#956;&#8208;Hydridodiborane(4) Anion</title>
      <dc:description>
Happy divorce: The hydride adduct of a tetraaryl diborane(4) has been shown to possess a nucleophilic B&#8722;B bond. Upon heterolysis, a diaryl boryl anion is released, which can act as a boron&#8208;centered nucleophile or undergo [4+1] cycloaddition reactions to furnish spiroborates.







Abstract
The tetraaryl &#956;&#8208;hydridodiborane(4) anion [2H]&#8722; possesses nucleophilic B&#8722;B and B&#8722;H bonds. Treatment of K[2H] with the electrophilic 9&#8208;H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene (HBFlu) furnishes the B3 cluster K[3], with a triangular boron core linked through two BHB two&#8208;electron, three&#8208;center bonds and one electron&#8208;precise B&#8722;B bond, reminiscent of the prominent [B3H8]&#8722; anion. Upon heating or prolonged stirring at room temperature, K[3] rearranges to a slightly more stable isomer K[3&#8201;a]. The reaction of M[2H] (M+=Li+, K+) with MeI or Me3SiCl leads to equimolar amounts of 9&#8208;R&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene and HBFlu (R=Me or Me3Si). Thus, [2H]&#8722; behaves as a masked [:BFlu]&#8722; nucleophile. The HBFlu by&#8208;product was used in&#8197;situ to establish a tandem substitution&#8208;hydroboration reaction: a 1:1 mixture of M[2H] and allyl bromide gave the 1,3&#8208;propylene&#8208;linked ditopic 9&#8208;borafluorene 5 as sole product. M[2H] also participates in unprecedented [4+1] cycloadditions with dienes to furnish dialkyl diaryl spiroborates, M[R2BFlu].

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Boronate Ester Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Large Single Crystalline Domains for a Neuromorphic Memory Device</title>
      <dc:description>
Mimicking synaptic plasticity: A free&#8208;standing boronate ester&#8208;linked 2D COF thin film has been achieved with record crystalline domain size as large as &#8776;60&#8197;&#956;m2 via an interfacial synthesis method. This film was integrated into an organic thin film/Si nanowire&#8208;based field effect transistor to mimic neuronal synapses capable of learning&#8211;erasing&#8211;forgetting memory process.







Abstract
Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of crystalline boronate ester covalent organic frameworks (BECOFs) in powder and thin&#8208;film through solvothermal method and on&#8208;solid&#8208;surface synthesis, respectively, their applications in electronics, remain less explored due to the challenges in thin&#8208;film processability and device integration associated with the control of film thickness, layer orientation, stability and crystallinity. Moreover, although the crystalline domain sizes of the powder samples can reach micrometer scale (up to &#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;m), the reported thin&#8208;film samples have so far rather small crystalline domains up to 100&#8197;nm. Here we demonstrate a general and efficient synthesis of crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BECOF films composed of porphyrin macrocycles and phenyl or naphthyl linkers (named as 2D BECOF&#8208;PP or 2D BECOF&#8208;PN) by employing a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) on the water surface. The achieved 2D BECOF&#8208;PP is featured as free&#8208;standing thin film with large single&#8208;crystalline domains up to &#8776;60&#8197;&#956;m2 and tunable thickness from 6 to 16&#8197;nm. A hybrid memory device composed of 2D BECOF&#8208;PP film on silicon nanowire&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor is demonstrated as a bio&#8208;inspired system to mimic neuronal synapses, displaying a learning&#8211;erasing&#8211;forgetting memory process.

The achieved 2D BECOF&#8208;PP is featured as free&#8208;standing thin film with large single&#8208;crystalline domains up to &#8776;60&#8197;&#956;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and tunable thickness from 6 to 16&#8197;nm. A hybrid memory device composed of 2D BECOF&#8208;PP film on silicon nanowire&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor is demonstrated as a bio&#8208;inspired system to mimic neuronal synapses, displaying a learning&#8211;erasing&#8211;forgetting memory process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zeise, Liebig, Jensen, H&#252;ckel, Dewar, and the Olefin &#960;&#8208;Complex Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
The first organometallic compounds, now known to be platinum &#960;&#8208;complexes, were discovered in 1825&#8211;1830 by Zeise. This discovery sparked a controversy between Liebig, Dumas, Berzelius, and W&#246;hler. In discussions with Jensen in the 1930s, H&#252;ckel still believed that the compounds arose from simple addition to the ethylene double bond. It was not until 1951 that Dewar formulated the MO description of the bonding in transition&#8208;metal &#960;&#8208;complexes.







Abstract
Zeise's salt, KPt(C2H4)Cl3, was the first characterized organometallic compound; it was also the first olefin &#960;&#8208;complex. It was published in 1825&#8211;1830 in the middle of a fight between Dumas on the one hand and Berzelius and Liebig on the other, who defended the etherin (ethylene) and radical theories, respectively. Although Zeise's formulation as a compound containing ethylene was vindicated, the fight went on for many years. This was a time when the theories of organic chemistry were being developed, before any clear understanding of the nature of molecules, bonding, and structure. Zeise thought of the structure of his salt as a product of the addition of PtCl2 to ethylene. Jensen assumed a central bonding to ethylene but needed theoretical assistance to explain it. His attempt to obtain such an explanation from H&#252;ckel failed, and it was Dewar who explained the nature of &#960;&#8208;complexes in molecular orbital terms in 1951.

      <title>Preparative Mass Spectrometry Using a Rotating&#8208;Wall Mass Analyzer</title>
      <dc:description>
You spin me round: Preparative mass spectrometry using a rotating&#8208;wall mass analyzer enables the deposition of well&#8208;defined polyatomic ions from small molecules to nanoclusters and protein complexes as well as the high&#8208;throughput separation and deposition of molecules from multicomponent mixtures. The approach is of interest to the design and preparation of functional interfaces and uses an inexpensive and compact instrumentation.







Abstract
The design of functional interfaces is central to both fundamental and applied research in materials science and energy technology. We introduce a new, broadly applicable technique for the precisely controlled high&#8208;throughput preparation of well&#8208;defined interfaces containing polyatomic species ranging from small ions to nanocrystals and large protein complexes. The mass&#8208;dispersive deposition of ions onto surfaces is achieved using a rotating&#8208;wall mass analyzer, a compact device which enables the separation of ions using low voltages and has a theoretically unlimited mass range. We demonstrate an efficient deposition of singly charged Au144(SC4H9)60 ions (33.7&#8197;kDa), which opens up exciting opportunities for the structural characterization of nanocrystals and their assemblies using transmission electron microscopy. Our approach also enables the high&#8208;throughput deposition of mass&#8208;selected ions from multicomponent mixtures, which is of interest to the controlled preparation of surface gradients and rapid screening of molecules in mixtures for a specific property.

      <dc:description>
A matter of form: Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is based on the use of controlled/living polymerization (CLP) and consists of extending solvophilic living chains with a solvophobic segment to generate block copolymers that self&#8208;assemble to achieve various morphologies in&#8197;situ. This Review covers PISA mediated by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), one of the most popular radical CLP methods.







Abstract
After a brief history that positions polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in the field of polymer chemistry, this Review will cover the fundamentals of the PISA mechanism. Furthermore, this Review will also give an overview of some of the features and limitations of RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in terms of the choice of the components involved, the nature of the nanoobjects that can be obtained and how the syntheses can be controlled, as well as some potential applications.

      <title>Genome Mining of Oxidation Modules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Synthases Reveals a Culturable Source for Lobatamides</title>
      <dc:description>
O where art thou: In the classic model for modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), a small set of reactions generate combinatorially substituted carbon chains. Architecturally diverse PKS modules were identified that diversify polyketides by oxygenation. An orphan PKS with two oxygenase modules from a plant symbiont was found to produce lobatamides, which are in&#8208;chain&#8208;oxygenated oxime&#8208;bearing cytotoxins that were previously only known from a tunicate.







Abstract
Bacterial trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are multimodular megaenzymes that biosynthesize many bioactive natural products. They contain a remarkable range of domains and module types that introduce different substituents into growing polyketide chains. As one such modification, we recently reported Baeyer&#8211;Villiger&#8208;type oxygen insertion into nascent polyketide backbones, thereby generating malonyl thioester intermediates. In this work, genome mining focusing on architecturally diverse oxidation modules in trans&#8208;AT PKSs led us to the culturable plant symbiont Gynuella sunshinyii, which harbors two distinct modules in one orphan PKS. The PKS product was revealed to be lobatamide A, a potent cytotoxin previously only known from a marine tunicate. Biochemical studies show that one module generates glycolyl thioester intermediates, while the other is proposed to be involved in oxime formation. The data suggest varied roles of oxygenation modules in the biosynthesis of polyketide scaffolds and support the importance of trans&#8208;AT PKSs in the specialized metabolism of symbiotic bacteria.

      <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantification of multiple neurochemicals, together with recording of electrical signals in a live brain has long been a prominent challenge. Here, we created an electrochemophysiological microarray (ECPM) for real&#8208;time mapping and simultaneous quantification of chemical signals for multiple ions in the deep brain of freely moving rat, in which selective and accurate microelectrode arrays were developed for direct determination of K  +  , Ca  2+  , Na  +  and pH using open&#8208;circuit potentiometry. Specific recognition ionophores were synthesized and optimized for determination of K  +  , Ca  2+  , Na  +  and pH. An inner&#8208;reference electrode was also developed to provide a built&#8208;in correction for avoiding interferences in the complicated brain. The developed microarrays demonstrating high accuracy and selectivity were successfully applied in real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantification of multi&#8208;ions in a live brain. The extra current&#8208;free potentiometry allowed mapping and biosensing of chemical signals, together with recording of electrical signals in the whole brain without cross&#8208;talk, for the first time.

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkynylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Picobello: A picolinamide directing group enables a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of unactivated olefins. The transformation can proceed through both 6&#8208;endo&#8208; and 6&#8208;exo&#8208;alkenyl palladacycles to afford 1,3&#8208;enynes in good yield and high E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective C&#8722;H functionalization with bromoalkynes and electronically unbiased olefins is reported. The picolinamide directing group enables the formation of putative 5 and 6&#8208;exo&#8208;metallacycles as intermediates to afford monoalkynylated products in up to 91&#8201;% yield in a stereospecific fashion. The systematic study reveals that substrates with a wide range of substituents on the olefin and bromoalkyne coupling partners are tolerated. Chemoselective transformations were demonstrated for the obtained amides, olefins, and alkynes.

      <title>From C1 to C3: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed gem&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)olefination of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Esters with TMSCF3</title>
      <dc:description>
Chain growth: A copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot C1&#8208;to&#8208;C3 process enables the conversion of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters into 1,1&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)alkenes using TMSCF3 as the sole fluorocarbon source. The reaction proceeds at room temperature and is scalable.







Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)olefination of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters, using TMSCF3 as the only fluorocarbon source, has been developed and provides an exquisite method to access gem&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)alkenes. This unprecedented olefination process involves a carbene migratory insertion into &#8220;CuCF3&#8221; to generate the &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted organocopper species, which then undergoes &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination and two consecutive addition&#8208;elimination processes to give the desired products. The key to this efficient one&#8208;pot C1&#8208;to&#8208;C3 synthetic protocol lies in the controllable double (over single and triple) trifluoromethylations of the gem&#8208;difluoroalkene intermediates.

Abstract
Chiral 1,2&#8208;bimetallic reagents are useful motifs in synthetic chemistry. Although syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;bimetallic compounds can be prepared by alkene dimetallation, anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;bimetallics are still rare. The stereospecific 1,2&#8208;metallate shift that occurs during conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling is shown to enable a practical and modular approach to the catalytic synthesis of enantioenriched anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;borosilanes.

Pyroelectrics are borane: Plasticity and mechanical flexibility in trimethylamine borane are harnessed to generate a piezoelectric and pyroelectric flexible film for sensing and energy harvesting applications.







Abstract
We demonstrate that trimethylamine borane can exhibit desirable piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties. The material was shown to be able operate as a flexible film for both thermal sensing, thermal energy conversion and mechanical sensing with high open circuit voltages (&gt;10&#8197;V). A piezoelectric coefficient of d33&#8776;10&#8211;16&#8197;pC&#8201;N&#8722;1, and pyroelectric coefficient of p&#8776;25.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1 were achieved after poling, with high pyroelectric figure of merits for sensing and harvesting, along with a relative permittivity of

      <title>Active Electron Density Modulation of Co3O4&#8208;Based Catalysts Enhances their Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface enhancement: The surface electronic structure of Co3O4 can be effectively regulated, thereby leading to substantial enhancement of its oxygen evolution reaction performance.







Abstract
Despite the fact that many strategies have been developed to improve the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the precise modulation of the surface electronic properties of catalysts to improve their catalytic activity is still challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface active electron density of Co3O4 can be effectively regulated by an argon&#8208;ion irradiation method. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and synchrotron x&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, UV photoelectron spectrometry, and DFT calculations show that the surface active electron density band center of Co3O4 has been upshifted, leading to a significantly enhanced absorption capability of the oxo group. The optimized Co3O4&#8208;based catalysts exhibit an excellent overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 54&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, superior to the capability of the benchmark RuO2, representing one of the best Co&#8208;based OER catalysts. This approach could guide the future rational design and discovery of ideal electrocatalysts.

      <title>Direct Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from Nitric Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>NO removal from exhausted gas is necessary due to its damage to environment. Meanwhile, the electrochemical ammonia synthesis (EAS) from N  2  is suffering from a low reaction rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we propose an alternative route for ammonia synthesis from exhausted NO via electrocatalysis. Density functional theory calculations indicate electrochemical NO reduction (NORR) is more active than N  2  reduction (NRR). Via a descriptor&#8208;based approach, Cu was screened out to be the most active metal catalyst for NORR to NH  3  due to its moderate reactivity. Moreover, kinetic calculations reveal NH  3  is the most preferred product relative to H  2  , N  2  O and N  2  on Cu. Experimentally, a record&#8208;high EAS rate of 517.1 &#956;mol&#183;cm  &#8208;2  &#183;h  &#8208;1  and FE of 93.5% were achieved at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE using a Cu foam electrode, exhibiting stable electrocatalytic performances with 100 hours run.

Electrochemical intramolecular C&#8722;S bond formation leading to derivatives is achieved. Bromide catalytically promoted the reaction as a halogen mediator.







Abstract
The first electrochemical dehydrogenative C&#8722;S bond formation leading to thienoacene derivatives is described. Several thienoacene derivatives were synthesized by dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/S&#8722;H coupling. The addition of nBu4NBr, which catalytically promoted the reaction as a halogen mediator, was essential.

We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208;carbonylalkylarylation of vinylarenes with &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyl compounds and arylzinc reagents.

      <title>Vancomycin Resistance is Overcome by Conjugation of Polycationic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>Multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria represent one of the biggest challenges facing modern medicine.

The increasing prevalence of glycopeptide resistance compromises the efficacy of vancomycin, for a long time considered as the last resort for the treatment of resistant bacteria. In order to reestablish its activity, polycationic peptides were conjugated to vancomycin. By site&#8208;specific conjugation, derivatives that bear the peptide moiety at four different sites of the antibiotic were synthesized. The most potent compounds exhibited an approximately 1,000&#8208;fold increased antimicrobial activity and were able to overcome the most important types of vancomycin resistance. Additional blocking experiments using D&#8208;Ala&#8208;D&#8208;Ala revealed the prevalence of a mode of action beyond cell wall inhibition. As further highlight, the antimicrobial potential of the lead candidate FU002 for bacterial infection treatments could be demonstrated in an in vivo  efficacy study.

      <title>Light&#8208;driven Crawling of Molecular Crystals via Phase&#8208;dependent Transient Elastic Lattice Deformation</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we report the light&#8208;driven crawling of a molecular crystal that can form three phases, i.e., the &#945;, &#946;, and &#947; phases. We demonstrate that laser irradiation of the molecular crystal can generate phase&#8208;dependent  transient elastic lattice deformation  . The resulting elastic lattice deformation that follows scanning irradiation of a laser can actuate the different phases of molecular crystal to move with different velocity and direction. Because the &#947; phase has a large Young&#8217;s modulus (ca. 26 GPa), a force of 0.1 &#956;N can be generated under one laser spot. The generated force is sufficient to actuate the &#947;&#8208;formed molecular crystals in a wide dimensional range to move longitudinally at a velocity of ca. 60 &#956;m min  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude faster than the &#945; and &#946; phases.</dc:description>

      <title>CO2&#8208;induced spin state switching at room temperature in a monomeric cobalt(II) complex with the porous nature</title>
      <dc:description>The first example of CO 2  &#8208;responsive spin state conversion between high&#8208;spin (HS) and low&#8208;spin (LS) states at room temperature was achieved in a monomeric cobalt(II) complex. A neutral cobalt(II) complex, [Co II  (COO&#8208;terpy) 2  ]&#183;4H 2  O ( 1&#183;4H 2  O  ), stably formed cavities generated via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking motifs and hydrogen bond networks, resulted in the accommodation of four water molecules. A crystalline 1&#183;4H 2  O  transformed to the solvent&#8208;free 1  without loss of the porosity by heating up to 420 K. Compound 1  exhibited a selective carbon dioxide (CO 2  ) adsorption via a gate&#8208;open type of the structural modification. Furthermore, the HS/LS transition temperature ( T  1/2  ) was able to be tuned by the CO 2  &#8208;pressure over a wide temperature range. Unlike 1  exhibits the HS state at 290 K, the CO 2  &#8208;accomodated form 1&#8835;CO 2  ( P  CO2  = 110 kPa) was stabilized in the LS state at 290 K probably caused by &#8220;chemical pressure&#8221; effect by CO 2  accommodation, which provides reversible spin&#8208;state conversion by introducing/evacuating CO 2  gas into/from 1  .

      <title>Hidden isolated OH at the charged hydrophobic interface revealed by two&#8208;dimensional heterodyne&#8208;detected VSFG spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Water around the hydrophobic groups mediates hydrophobic interaction that plays key roles in many chemical and biological processes. Thus, molecular&#8208;level elucidation of the properties of the water in the vicinity of the hydrophobic group is important. We report on the structure and dynamics of water at two oppositely charged hydrophobic ion/water interfaces, i.e. the tetraphenylborate ion (TPB  &#8208;  )/water and tetraphenylarsonium ion (TPA  +  )/water interfaces, which are clarified by two&#8208;dimensional heterodyne&#8208;detected vibrational sum frequency generation (2D HD&#8208;VSFG) spectroscopy. The obtained 2D HD&#8208;VSFG spectra of anionic TPB  &#8208;  interface reveal the existence of distinct &#960;&#8208;hydrogen bonded OH groups in addition to the usual hydrogen bonded OH groups, which is hidden in the steady&#8208;state spectrum. In contrast, 2D HD&#8208;VSFG spectra of cationic TPA  +  interface only show the presence of usual hydrogen bonded OH groups. The present study demonstrates that the sign of the interfacial charge governs the structure and dynamics of water molecules that face the hydrophobic region.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here we propose an innovative strategy to synthesize single&#8208;crystal nanowires (NWs) of the Al  3+  dicarboxylate MIL&#8208;69(Al) MOF by using graphene oxide nanoscrolls as structure directing agents. MIL&#8208;69(Al) NWs with an average diameter of 70 &#177; 20 nm and lengths up to 2 &#956;m were found to preferentially grow along the [001] crystallographic direction. Advanced characterization tools (electron diffraction, TEM, STEM&#8208;HAADF, SEM, XPS) and molecular modelling revealed the mechanism of formation of MIL&#8208;69(Al) NWs involving size&#8208;confinement and templating effects. The formation of MIL&#8208;69(Al) seeds and the self&#8208;scroll of GO sheets followed by the anisotropic growth of MIL&#8208;69(Al) crystals are mediated by specific GO sheets/MOF interactions.

      <title>Chromium Catalyzed Alkylation of Amines by Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>The alkylation of amines by alcohols is a broadly applicable, sustainable, and selective method for the synthesis of alkyl amines, which are important bulk and fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or agrochemicals. Here we report that Cr complexes can catalyze this C&#8208;N bond formation reaction. We synthesized and isolated 35 examples of alkylated amines. Thirteen previously undisclosed products could be obtained and the use of amino alcohols as alkylating agents could be demonstrated. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups, among them hydrogenation sensitive examples. In comparison to many other alcohol&#8208;based amine alkylation protocols where a stoichiometric amount of base is required, our Cr based catalyst system permits product isolation with yields higher than 90% for various alkyl amines with a catalytic amount of base only.

Herein, we report the synthesis of three benzidine linked, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (the so&#8208;called &#8220;superbenzene&#8221;) based ortho&#8208; (1&#8208;NH), para&#8208; (2&#8208;NH), and meta&#8208; (3&#8208;NH) cyclophanes through intermolecular Yamamoto coupling reaction of structurally pre&#8208;organized precursors. Subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation gave the corresponding quinoidal benzidine linked cyclophanes 1&#8208;N, 2&#8208;N and 3&#8208;N. Their geometries were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and their electronic properties were investigated by electronic absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The quinoidal benzidine&#8208;linked cyclophanes all show thermally populated paramagnetic activity with a relatively large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The structure&#8208;property relationship was discussed. Two enantiomers for the ortho&#8208; cyclophanes (1&#8208;NH and 1&#8208;N) were isolated by chiral HPLC and their chiral figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocyclic structures were identified by X&#8208;ray analysis and circular dichroism spectral measurements. The cage&#8208;like cyclophanes 2&#8208;NH and 3&#8208;NH with concave surface can selectively encapsulate fullerene C70 with an association constant Ka of 1.95&#215;105 M&#8208;1 and 5.51&#215;104 M&#8208;1, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Unexpected Chromophore&#8208;Solvent Reaction Leads to Bicomponent Aggregation&#8208;Induced Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Organic luminogens with persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have found a wide range of applications in sensing, bioimaging, illumination, and information encryption However, many RTP luminogens are prone to severe quenching in the crystalline state. Herein we report a working strategy to construct a donor&#8208;sp3&#8208;acceptor type of luminogen which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) while the donor&#8208;sp2&#8208;acceptor counterpart structure exhibits non&#8208;emissive solid state. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that a trace amount (0.01%) of structurally similar derivative, produced by a side reaction with the DMF solvent, could induce strong RTP with an absolute RTP yield up to 25.4% and a lifetime of 48 ms, although the identified substance does not show RTP by itself. Single&#8208;crystal XRD&#8208;based calculations suggest that n&#8208;&#963;* orbital interactions as a result of structural similarity may be responsible for the strong RTP in the bicomponent system. The current study provides a new insight into the design of multi&#8208;component, solid&#8208;state RTP materials from organic molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Ni(COD)(DQ): An Air&#8208;Stable 18&#8208;Electron Nickel(0)&#8211;Olefin Precatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
Old complex, new tricks: Ni(COD)(DQ) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, DQ=duroquinone) is a remarkably stable Ni0&#8208;olefin complex first described in the 1960s. Its ability to serve as a precatalyst for a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions is demonstrated.







Abstract
We report that Ni(COD)(DQ) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, DQ=duroquinone), an air&#8208;stable 18&#8208;electron complex originally described by Schrauzer in 1962, is a competent precatalyst for a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthetic methods from the literature. Due to its apparent stability, use of Ni(COD)(DQ) as a precatalyst allows reactions to be conveniently performed without use of an inert&#8208;atmosphere glovebox, as demonstrated across several case studies.

      <title>General Strategy for Synthesis of Ordered Pt3M Intermetallics with Ultrasmall Particle Size</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel and general strategy for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported atomically ordered Pt3M (M=Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) intermetallic nanoparticles is reported under the aid of freeze&#8208;drying technology. This synthetic strategy is demonstrated to be effective for the preparation and handling of nanoparticles with controlled particle size and ordered phase.







Abstract
Controllable synthesis of atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial to obtain superior electrocatalytic performance for fuel cell reactions, but still remains arduous. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and general hydrogel&#8208;freeze drying strategy for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported Pt3M (M=Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) intermetallic NPs (Pt3M/rGO&#8208;HF) with ultrasmall particle size (about 3&#8197;nm) and dramatic monodispersity. The formation of hydrogel prevents the aggregation of graphene oxide and significantly promotes their excellent dispersion, while a freeze&#8208;drying can retain the hydrogel derived three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) porous structure and immobilize the metal precursors with defined atomic ratio on GO support during solvent sublimation, which is not afforded by traditional oven drying. The subsequent annealing process produces rGO supported ultrasmall ordered Pt3M intermetallic NPs (&#8776;3&#8197;nm) due to confinement effect of 3D porous structure. Such Pt3M intermetallic NPs exhibit the smallest particle size among the reported ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts. A detailed study of the synthesis of ordered intermetallic Pt3Mn/rGO catalyst is provided as an example of a generally applicable method. This study provides an economical and scalable route for the controlled synthesis of Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts, which can pave a way for the commercialization of fuel cell technologies.

      <title>Improved Acid Resistance of a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage Enables Cargo Release and Exchange between Hosts</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy for improving the acid resistance of a tetrahedral cage has been developed by incorporating additional free pyridyl units on its vertices. The guest binding properties of the cage are also altered compared to the analogous tetrahedron without these peripheral groups, allowing the functions of complete cargo delivery and exchange between the two capsules by using acid and base as chemical stimuli.







Abstract
The use of di(2&#8208;pyridyl)ketone in subcomponent self&#8208;assembly is introduced. When combined with a flexible triamine and zinc bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, this ketone formed a new Zn4L4 tetrahedron 1 bearing twelve uncoordinated pyridyl units around its metal&#8208;ion vertices. The acid stability of 1 was found to be greater than that of the analogous tetrahedron 2 built from 2&#8208;formylpyridine. Intriguingly, the peripheral presence of additional pyridine rings in 1 resulted in distinct guest binding behavior from that of 2, affecting guest scope as well as binding affinities. The different stabilities and guest affinities of capsules 1 and 2 enabled the design of systems whereby different cargoes could be moved between cages using acid and base as chemical stimuli.

      <title>The Glutathione/Metallothionein System Challenges the Design of Efficient O2&#8208;Activating Copper Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Copper complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs. O2&#8208;activating CuI/CuII complexes for cytosolic/nuclear targets are generally not stable against glutathione and metallothioneins, which are abundant in the nucleus and cytosol. This should be considered when designing CuI/CuII complexes for biological and medicinal applications.







Abstract
Copper complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs designed to cleave intracellular biomolecules by O2 activation. To exhibit such activity, the copper complex must be redox active and resistant to dissociation. Metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are abundant in the cytosol and nucleus. Because they are thiol&#8208;rich reducing molecules with high CuI affinity, they are potential competitors for a copper ion bound in a copper drug. Herein, we report the investigation of a panel of CuI/CuII complexes often used as drugs, with diverse coordination chemistries and redox potentials. We evaluated their catalytic activity in ascorbate oxidation based on redox cycling between CuI and CuII, as well as their resistance to dissociation or inactivation under cytosolically relevant concentrations of GSH and MT. O2&#8208;activating CuI/CuII complexes for cytosolic/nuclear targets are generally not stable against the GSH/MT system, which creates a challenge for their future design.

      <title>Abiotic Chemical Fuels for the Operation of Molecular Machines</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular gas station: This Minireview covers the state of the art of abiotic chemical fuels that have been used to trigger complete cycles of motion of molecular machines. Particular emphasis is placed on the operation mechanism of the machine/fuel systems.







Abstract
Natural molecular machines require a continuous fuel supply to perform motions and/or remain in a functional state. Consequently, the aim of developing artificial devices and materials with life&#8208;type properties has motivated a growing interest in abiotic chemical fuels and in their supply modalities. Many artificial molecular machines have been developed in which the sequential addition of several chemical reagents allows the machine to perform complete cycles of motion. Only recently, examples of molecular machines whose cycles of motion are triggered by a single pulse of fuel have been reported. The latter systems are the object of this Minireview where the abiotic chemical fuels used so far to trigger the complete cycles of motion of molecular machines are described, with particular emphasis on the operation mechanism of the machine/fuel systems.

Abstract
A divergent synthetic approach to six Ganoderma meroterpenoids, namely ganocins&#8197;A&#8211;C, ganocochlearins&#8197;C and D, and cochlearol&#8197;T, has been developed for the first time. This synthetic route features a two&#8208;phase strategy which includes early&#8208;stage rapid construction of a common planar tricyclic intermediate followed by highly selective late&#8208;stage transformations into various Ganoderma meroterpenoids. Key to the strategy are a bioinspired intramolecular hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and Stahl&#8208;type oxidative aromatization, allowing efficient formation of the common tricyclic phenol intermediate. A nucleophilic dearomatization of the phenol unit, combined with a regioselective 1,4&#8208;reduction of the resulting dienone, enabled rapid access to ganocins&#8197;B and C. Additionally, site&#8208;selective Mukaiyama hydration, followed by an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition/triflation cascade, served as a key strategic element in the chemical synthesis of ganocin&#8197;A.

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Interleukin&#8208;2 and Disulfide Stabilizing Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
Penicillin shot: Convergent, ester&#8208;forming KAHA ligations under acidic conditions facilitate the assembly of the hydrophobic cytokine interleukin&#8208;2. This flexible strategy allows the preparation of more stable disulfides analogues constructed from the non&#8208;canonical amino acid penicillamine.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis allows the construction of well&#8208;defined structural variations and facilitates the development of deeper understanding of protein structure&#8211;function relationships and new protein engineering strategies. Herein, we report the chemical synthesis of interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) variants on a multimilligram scale and the formation of non&#8208;natural disulfide mimetics that improve stability against reduction. The synthesis was accomplished by convergent KAHA ligations; the acidic conditions of KAHA ligation proved to be valuable for the solubilization of the hydrophobic segments of IL&#8208;2. The bioactivity of the synthetic IL&#8208;2 and its analogues were shown to be equipotent to recombinant IL&#8208;2 and exhibit improved stability against reducing agents.

      <title>Deoxyfluorination with CuF2: Enabled by Using a Lewis Base Activating Group
</title>
      <dc:description>
A Lewis base activating group strategy enables deoxyfluorination using first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides. Using CuF2 as an exemplar, activation of an O&#8208;alkylisourea adduct, formed in situ, allows effective nucleophilic fluoride transfer to a range of primary and secondary alcohols. Spectroscopic investigations were used to probe the origin of the enhanced reactivity of CuF2. The method is also amenable to 18F&#8208;radiolabeling. DIC=N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide.







Abstract
Deoxyfluorination is a primary method for the formation of C&#8722;F bonds. Bespoke reagents are commonly used because of issues associated with the low reactivity of metal fluorides. Reported here is the development of a simple strategy for deoxyfluorination, using first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides, and it overcomes these limitations. Using CuF2 as an exemplar, activation of an O&#8208;alkylisourea adduct, formed in situ, allows effective nucleophilic fluoride transfer to a range of primary and secondary alcohols. Spectroscopic investigations have been used to probe the origin of the enhanced reactivity of CuF2. The utility of the process in enabling 18F&#8208;radiolabeling is also presented.

      <dc:description>
Unprecedented synthetic routes to fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), from simple phenol derivatives by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulative dimerization of phenylene triflate through twofold inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation, have been established. The formed partially fused PAHs can be smoothly transformed into a variety of fully fused PAHs by the Scholl reaction.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent an emerging class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the area of optoelectronic devices and materials. Unprecedented synthetic routes to various PAHs from simple phenol derivatives by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulative dimerization of phenylene triflate through twofold inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation have been established. The initially formed partially fused PAHs can be smoothly transformed into a variety of fully fused PAHs by the Scholl reaction. Furthermore, the reactions of phenanthrene&#8208;substituted aryl triflates proceeded regioselectively. The findings inspired the development of a rapid and efficient synthesis of polybenzoacene derivatives. This study not only allows transformation of phenyl triflates, but also discloses a new retrosynthetic strategy towards PAHs, especially polybenzoacenes.

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Activity of Au(111) in Alkaline Media through Molecular Engineering of a 2D Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Moving catalysts on the volcano: The electrochemical production of hydrogen can be promoted by the synergy between a two&#8208;dimensional polymer and a gold electrode. Engineering the molecular structure of the polymer alters the adsorption energies of the reactants, intermediates, and products and helps to move gold towards the top of the volcano plot.







Abstract
The electrochemical splitting of water holds promise for the storage of energy produced intermittently by renewable energy sources. The evolution of hydrogen currently relies on the use of platinum as a catalyst&#8212;which is scarce and expensive&#8212;and ongoing research is focused towards finding cheaper alternatives. In this context, 2D polymers grown as single layers on surfaces have emerged as porous materials with tunable chemical and electronic structures that can be used for improving the catalytic activity of metal surfaces. Here, we use designed organic molecules to fabricate covalent 2D architectures by an Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reaction on Au(111). The polymer&#8208;patterned gold electrode exhibits a hydrogen evolution reaction activity up to three times higher than that of bare gold. Through rational design of the polymer on the molecular level we engineered hydrogen evolution activity by an approach that can be easily extended to other electrocatalytic reactions.

      <title>Mining Symbionts of a Spider&#8208;Transmitted Fungus Illuminates Uncharted Biosynthetic Pathways to Cytotoxic Benzolactones</title>
      <dc:description>
Spider sense: The fungus Rhizopus microsporus, isolated from necrotic tissue resulting from a spider bite, was found to contain bacteria (Burkholderia sp.) that produce a complex of highly cytotoxic compounds (necroximes). Analysis of the PKS/NRPS hybrid assembly line and genome mining revealed the molecular basis of the biosynthesis of V&#8208;ATPase&#8208;inhibiting antitumor agents from diverse biological origins.







Abstract
A spider&#8208;transmitted fungus (Rhizopus microsporus) that was isolated from necrotic human tissue was found to harbor endofungal bacteria (Burkholderia sp.). Metabolic profiling of the symbionts revealed a complex of cytotoxic agents (necroximes). Their structures were characterized as oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides with a peptidic side chain. The potently cytotoxic necroximes are also formed in symbiosis with the fungal host and could have contributed to the necrosis. Genome sequencing and computational analyses revealed a novel modular PKS/NRPS assembly line equipped with several non&#8208;canonical domains. Based on gene&#8208;deletion mutants, we propose a biosynthetic model for bacterial benzolactones. We identified specific traits that serve as genetic handles to find related salicylate macrolide pathways (lobatamide, oximidine, apicularen) in various other bacterial genera. Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway enables biosynthetic engineering and genome&#8208;mining approaches.

      <title>Accessing Tunable Afterglows from Highly Twisted Nonaromatic Organic AIEgens via Effective Through&#8208;Space Conjugation
</title>
      <dc:description>
AIE meets tunable afterglows: Highly distorted and nonaromatic CBSI and OBSI are non&#8208;luminescent when molecularly dissolved in solutions, but exhibit distinct AIE and tunable p&#8208;RTP features in aggregation states. This is on account of the effective through&#8208;space conjugation among the moieties with &#960; and/or n electrons, which results in the formation of diverse emissive clusters with highly rigidified conformations.







Abstract
Nonaromatic, cross&#8208;conjugated, and highly twisted luminogens consisting of acylated succinimides demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics along with tunable multicolor photoluminescence and afterglows in their single crystals. Effective through&#8208;space conjugation among different moieties bearing n/&#960; electrons promote the spin&#8211;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing and lead to diverse emissive clusters with concurrently rigidified conformations, thus allowing readily tunable emissions. Derived from it, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is illustrated. These results should spur the rational design of novel nonaromatic AIEgens, and moreover advance understandings of the non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence and the origin of tunable multicolor afterglows.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AIE meets tunable afterglows&lt;/b&gt;: Highly distorted and nonaromatic CBSI and OBSI are non&#8208;luminescent when molecularly dissolved in solutions, but exhibit distinct AIE and tunable p&#8208;RTP features in aggregation states. This is on account of the effective through&#8208;space conjugation among the moieties with &#960; and/or n electrons, which results in the formation of diverse emissive clusters with highly rigidified conformations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonaromatic, cross&#8208;conjugated, and highly twisted luminogens consisting of acylated succinimides demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics along with tunable multicolor photoluminescence and afterglows in their single crystals. Effective through&#8208;space conjugation among different moieties bearing n/&#960; electrons promote the spin&#8211;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing and lead to diverse emissive clusters with concurrently rigidified conformations, thus allowing readily tunable emissions. Derived from it, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is illustrated. These results should spur the rational design of novel nonaromatic AIEgens, and moreover advance understandings of the non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence and the origin of tunable multicolor afterglows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA Functionalization of Upconversion Nanoparticles and Their Programmable Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;dependent interactions between DNA and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are systematically investigated. Poly&#8208;cytosine (poly&#8208;C) has a high affinity for the UCNP surface. Based on this finding, a general strategy to synthesize monodispersed DNA&#8208;UCNP conjugates is developed using poly&#8208;C&#8208;containing diblock DNA strands, which can be used for DNA&#8208;guided UCNP assembly.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (DNA&#8208;UCNPs) that combine the functions of DNA and the optical features of UCNPs have shown great promise in a wide range of fields. However, challenges remain in precisely tethering and orienting the DNA strands on the UCNP surface. Herein, we systematically investigate the sequence dependence of DNAs in their interactions with UCNPs, and reveal that poly&#8208;cytosine (poly&#8208;C) has high affinity for the UCNP surface. A general approach to synthesize monodispersed DNA&#8208;UCNP conjugates is developed using poly&#8208;C&#8208;containing diblock DNA strands. The poly&#8208;C segment of the DNA strand binds to the surfaces of UCNPs and the second segment is oriented perpendicularly on the UCNP surface, making the DNA&#8208;UCNPs highly stable and monodispersed in aqueous solution. The dense layer of DNA on the UCNP surface enables the programmable assembly of UCNPs with other DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles or DNA origamis through hybridization, resulting in the formation of well&#8208;organized complex structures.

      <dc:description>
The heat is on: Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine derivatives forms a nanostructured contrast agent, which displays improved photoacoustic and photothermal properties.







Abstract
Phototheranostic nanoplatforms are of particular interest for cancer diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided therapy. Herein, we develop a supramolecular approach to fabricate a nanostructured phototheranostic agent through the direct self&#8208;assembly of two water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine derivatives, PcS4 and PcN4. The nature of the molecular recognition between PcS4 and PcN4 facilitates the formation of nanostructure (PcS4&#8208;PcN4) and consequently enables the fabrication of PcS4&#8208;PcN4 with completely quenched fluorescence and reduced singlet oxygen generation, leading to the high photoacoustic and photothermal activity of PcS4&#8208;PcN4. In&#8197;vivo evaluations suggest that PcS4&#8208;PcN4 could not only efficiently visualize a tumor with high contrast through whole&#8208;body photoacoustic imaging but also enable excellent photothermal therapy for cancer.

      <title>A Photochemical Organocatalytic Strategy for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones by using Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
A radical time to alkylate ketones: A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach that enables the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using alkyl electrophiles recalcitrant to traditional ionic pathways is reported. The redox&#8208;neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with a chiral amine catalyst, which is used to develop a rare example of enantioselective organocatalytic &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones through a radical pathway.







Abstract
Reported herein is a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach to the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones. This method exploits the ability of a nucleophilic organocatalyst to generate radicals upon SN2&#8208;based activation of alkyl halides and blue light irradiation. The resulting open&#8208;shell intermediates are then intercepted by weakly nucleophilic silyl enol ethers, which would be unable to directly attack the alkyl halides through a traditional two&#8208;electron path. The mild reaction conditions allowed functionalization of the &#945; position of ketones with functional groups that are not compatible with classical anionic strategies. In addition, the redox&#8208;neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with a cinchona&#8208;based primary amine catalyst, which was used to develop a rare example of enantioselective organocatalytic radical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones.

      <title>Tailored Palladium Catalysts for Selective Synthesis of Conjugated Enynes by Monocarbonylation of 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
      <dc:description>
Precise synthesis: The new &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand Neolephos was designed and applied in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed monocarbonylation of 1,3&#8208;diynes. The precise synthesis of conjugated enynes was achieved in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yield with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The presented methodology can be used for simple diversification of natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
For the first time, the monoalkoxycarbonylation of easily available 1,3&#8208;diynes to give synthetically useful conjugated enynes has been realized. Key to success was the design and utilization of the new ligand 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphanyl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene (Neolephos), which permits the palladium&#8208;catalyzed selective carbonylation under mild conditions, providing a general preparation of functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields with excellent chemoselectivities. Synthetic applications that showcase the possibilities of this novel methodology include an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrans as well as the rapid construction of various heterocyclic, bicyclic, and polycyclic compounds.

Synthetic applications that showcase the possibilities of this novel methodology include an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrans as well as the rapid construction of various heterocyclic, bicyclic, and polycyclic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

In tandem: An organocatalytic enantioselective aldehyde &#945;&#8208;alkylation/semipinacol rearrangement was developed with both inter&#8208; and intramolecular reaction variants. This tandem reaction provides efficient access to a wide range of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, the synthetic value is demonstrated by an asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cerapicol.







Abstract
An enantioselective aldehyde &#945;&#8208;alkylation/semipinacol rearrangement was achieved through organo&#8208;SOMO catalysis. The catalytically generated enamine radical cation serves as a carbon radical electrophile that can stereoselectively add to the alkene of an allylic alcohol and initiate ensuing ring&#8208;expansion of cyclopropanol or cyclobutanol. This tandem reaction enables the production of a wide range of nonracemic functionalizable &#945;&#8208;quaternary&#8208;&#948;&#8208;carbonyl cycloketones in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity from simple aldehydes and allylic alcohols. As a key step, the intramolecular reaction was also successfully applied in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cerapicol.

      <title>Bidentate Chiral Bis(imidazolium)&#8208;Based Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors: Synthesis and Applications in Enantioselective Recognition and Catalysis
</title>
      <dc:description>
Enantioselective process: A dicationic bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donor based on iodoimidazolium groups with rigidly attached chiral moieties allowed the NMR&#8208;based enantiodiscrimination of a racemic diamine. It also enabled the first enantioselective reaction catalyzed by a &#8220;pure&#8221; halogen&#8208;based Lewis acid.







Abstract
Even though halogen bonding&#8212;the noncovalent interaction between electrophilic halogen substituents and Lewis bases&#8212;has now been established in molecular recognition and catalysis, its use in enantioselective processes is still very rarely explored. Herein, we present the synthesis of chiral bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donors based on two iodoimidazolium units with rigidly attached chiral sidearms. With these Lewis acids, chiral recognition of a racemic diamine is achieved in NMR studies. DFT calculations support a 1:1 interaction of the halogen&#8208;bond donor with both enantiomers and indicate that the chiral recognition is based on a different spatial orientation of the Lewis bases in the halogen&#8208;bonded complexes. In addition, moderate enantioselectivity is achieved in a Mukaiyama aldol reaction with a preorganized variant of the chiral halogen&#8208;bond donor. This represents the first case in which asymmetric induction was realized with a pure halogen&#8208;bond donor lacking any additional active functional groups.

      <title>Electrochemically Driven Cation Exchange Enables the Rational Design of Active CO2 Reduction Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Exchange of catalytic centers: Electrochemically driven cation exchange is a new method for the direct transformation of a H2 evolution catalyst (CoS2) into a CO2 reduction catalyst (Cu2S) by facile and systematic tuning of the ratio of binary cations. This method can rationally target catalytically active species (e.g. grain boundaries) and results in a superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency [Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 87&#8201;%].







Abstract
Metal oxides or sulfides are considered to be one of the most promising CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) precatalysts, owing to their electrochemical conversion in&#8197;situ into highly active electrocatalytic species. However, further improvement of the performance requires new tools to gain fine control over the composition of the active species and its structural features [e.g., grain boundaries (GBs) and undercoordinated sites (USs)], directly from a predesigned template material. Herein, we describe a novel electrochemically driven cation exchange (ED&#8208;CE) method that enables the conversion of a predesigned CoS2 template into a CO2RR catalyst, Cu2S. By means of ED&#8208;CE, the final Cu2S catalyst inherits the original 3&#8201;D morphology of CoS2, and preserves its high density of GBs. Additionally, the catalyst's phase structure, composition, and density of USs were precisely tuned, thus enabling rational design of active CO2RR sites. The obtained Cu2S catalyst achieved a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate Faradaic efficiency of over 87&#8201;% and a record high activity (among reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts). Hence, this study opens the way for utilization of ED&#8208;CE reactions to design advanced electrocatalysts.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Regulated Rhodium&#8211;Antimony Nanorods for Nitrogen Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8211;antimony nanorods: A unique class of surface&#8208;rough Rh2Sb nanorods (RNRs) has been created. Rh2Sb RNRs/C showed enhanced N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance with NH3 yield rate of 228.85&#177;12.96&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh at &#8722;0.45&#8197;VRHE, outperforming the surface&#8208;smooth Rh2Sb NRs/C, as well as the Rh nanoparticles/C, demonstrating the important role of surface regulation in boosting NRR.







Abstract
Surface regulation is an effective strategy to improve the performance of catalysts, but it has been rarely demonstrated for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to date. Now, surface&#8208;rough Rh2Sb nanorod (RNR) and surface&#8208;smooth Rh2Sb NR (SNR) were selectively created, and their performance for NRR was investigated. The high&#8208;index&#8208;facet bounded Rh2Sb RNRs/C exhibit a high NH3 yield rate of 228.85&#177;12.96&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh at &#8722;0.45&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), outperforming the Rh2Sb SNRs/C (63.07&#177;4.45&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh) and Rh nanoparticles/C (22.82&#177;1.49&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Rh), owing to the enhanced adsorption and activation of N2 on high&#8208;index facets. Rh2Sb RNRs/C also show durable stability with negligible activity decay after 10&#8197;h of successive electrolysis. The present work demonstrates that surface regulation plays an important role in promoting NRR activity and provides a new strategy for creating efficient NRR electrocatalysts.

      <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Establishing a platform: High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight catechol&#8208;functionalized polyolefins can be efficiently prepared. The introduction of different metal ions induces efficient interactions with the incorporated catechol groups, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties.

Abstract
The incorporation of comonomers during ethylene polymerization can efficiently modulate important material properties of the polyolefins. Utilizing bioresourced comonomers for the generation of high&#8208;performance polyolefin materials is attractive from a sustainability point of view. In this contribution, bioresourced eugenol and related comonomers were incorporated into polyolefins through palladium&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization and terpolymerization reactions. Importantly, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight catechol&#8208;functionalized polyolefins can be generated. The introduction of different metal ions induces efficient interactions with the incorporated catechol groups, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties. Moreover, the catechol functionality can greatly improve other properties such as surface properties, adhesion properties, and compatibilizing properties. The catechol&#8208;functionalized polyolefin was demonstrated as a versatile platform polymer for accessing various materials with dramatically different properties.

     alt="Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Establishing a platform&lt;/b&gt;: High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight catechol&#8208;functionalized polyolefins can be efficiently prepared. The introduction of different metal ions induces efficient interactions with the incorporated catechol groups, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties. The polyolefins provide a versatile platform polymer for accessing various materials with dramatically different properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of comonomers during ethylene polymerization can efficiently modulate important material properties of the polyolefins. Utilizing bioresourced comonomers for the generation of high&#8208;performance polyolefin materials is attractive from a sustainability point of view. In this contribution, bioresourced eugenol and related comonomers were incorporated into polyolefins through palladium&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization and terpolymerization reactions. Importantly, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight catechol&#8208;functionalized polyolefins can be generated. The introduction of different metal ions induces efficient interactions with the incorporated catechol groups, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties. Moreover, the catechol functionality can greatly improve other properties such as surface properties, adhesion properties, and compatibilizing properties. The catechol&#8208;functionalized polyolefin was demonstrated as a versatile platform polymer for accessing various materials with dramatically different properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perylene Bisimide and Naphthyl&#8208;Based Molecular Dyads: Hydrogen Bonds Driving Co&#8208;planarization and Anomalous Temperature&#8208;Response Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Weak bond, positive effect: A unique positive temperature effect in the single fluorescence emission of a fluorescent dyad containing both donor and acceptor moieties was observed. The origin is ascribed to the presence of coplanar and twisted structures owing to the driving of weak intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
The origin of the positive temperature effect in fluorescence emission of a newly designed perylene bisimide (PBI) derivative with two naphthyl units containing ortho&#8208;methoxy group (NM) at its bay positions (PBI&#8208;2NM) was elucidated. A key point is the finding of a weak hydrogen bond (&lt;5.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) between the methoxy group of the NM unit and a nearby hydrogen atom of the PBI core. It is the bonding that drives co&#8208;planarization of the different aromatic units, resulting in delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the compound as synthesized, inducing fluorescence quenching via intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). With increasing temperature, the co&#8208;planar structure could be distorted in part, resulting in a decreased degree of ICT, and hence leading to enhanced fluorescence emission. The unique positive temperature effect in emission induced by H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven co&#8208;planarization may pave a new avenue in designing functional molecular systems complementary to conventional methods.

      <title>An Activatable Polymeric Reporter for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Imaging of Invasive Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
A polymeric NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic probe: An activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) is designed to produce near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to a biomarker (urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator) for in&#8197;vivo imaging of invasive breast cancers. P&#8208;Dex not only has a high sensitivity and specificity towards the cancer biomarker but also undergoes renal clearance in living mice.







Abstract
Discriminative detection of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers is crucial for their effective treatment and prognosis. However, activatable probes able to do so in&#8197;vivo are rare. Herein, we report an activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) that specifically turns on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and photoacoustic (PA) signals in response to the urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) overexpressed in invasive breast cancer. P&#8208;Dex has a renal&#8208;clearable dextran backbone that is linked with a NIR dye caged with an uPA&#8208;cleavable peptide substrate. Such a molecular design allows P&#8208;Dex to passively target tumors, activate NIR fluorescence and PA signals to effectively distinguish invasive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer from noninvasive MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to minimize the toxicity potential. Thus, this polymeric reporter holds great promise for the early detection of malignant breast cancer.

      <title>Insights into Charge Transfer at an Atomically Precise Nanocluster/Semiconductor Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
Multitasking: Metal nanoclusters are not merely photosensitizers, they can also act as co&#8208;catalysts under appropriate conditions. Deposition of the atomically precise nanocluster Ag44(thiolate)30 onto a large&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor such as TiO2 led to a type&#8197;II heterojunction charge&#8208;transfer route being achieved on irradiation with UV/Vis light, with the cluster serving as a small&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor, rather than merely a photosensitizer.







Abstract
The deposition of an atomically precise nanocluster, for example, Ag44(SR)30, onto a large&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor such as TiO2 allows a clear interface to be obtained to study charge transfer at the interface. Changing the light source from visible light to simulated sunlight led to a three orders of magnitude enhancement in the photocatalytic H2 generation, with the H2 production rate reaching 7.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1. This is five times higher than that of TiO2 modified with Ag nanoparticles and even comparable to that of TiO2 modified with Pt nanoparticles under similar conditions. Energy band alignment and transient absorption spectroscopy reveal that the role of the metal clusters is different from that of both organometallic complexes and plasmonic nanoparticles: A type&#8197;II heterojunction charge&#8208;transfer route is achieved under UV/Vis irradiation, with the cluster serving as a small&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductor. This results in the clusters acting as co&#8208;catalysts rather than merely photosensitizers.

      <title>A Simple and Versatile Method for the Construction of Nearly Ideal Polymer Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Polymer networks usually contain numerous inhomogeneities that deteriorate their physical properties and should be eliminated to create reliable, high&#8208;performance materials. Here we introduce a simple method for the production of nearly ideal networks from various vinyl polymers through controlled polymerization and subsequent crosslinking. Monodisperse star polymers with bromide end groups were synthesized by atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization and end&#8208;linked with dithiol linkers using thiol&#8208;bromide chemistry. This simple procedure formed nearly ideal polymer networks, as revealed from elasticity of the formed gel and model conjugation reactions involving linear polymers. The versatility of this method was demonstrated by preparing networks of common vinyl polymers, including polyacrylates, polymethacrylate, and polystyrene. Our novel platform can be used to prepare multiple functional nearly ideal gels and elastomers, and to explore fundamental aspects of polymer networks.</dc:description>

      <title>An exceptional peroxide birefringent material resulting from d&#8208;&#960; interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringent materials, which can&#160;modulate&#160;the polarization of light,&#160;are almost exclusively&#160;limited to oxides. Peroxides have long been overlooked as&#160;birefringent&#160;materials, because they are usually not stable in air. Here we report the first peroxide&#160;birefringent material&#160;Rb  2  VO(O  2  )  2  F, whose single crystals keep transparent after being exposed in air for two weeks. Interestingly, Rb  2  VO(O  2  )  2  F&#160;does&#160;not feature an optimal anisotropic&#160;structure, but its&#160;birefringence (&#8710;  n  &#160;= 0.189&#160;at 546&#8201;nm) exceeds those of the majority of oxides. According to the first&#8208;principles calculations, this&#160;exceptional birefringence should be responsible to&#160;the strong electronic interactions between&#160;localized &#960;&#160;orbital of O  2  2&#8208;  &#160;anions and V  5+  &#160;3  d  orbitals, which may be also favorable to the stability in air for Rb  2  VO(O  2  )  2  F.

      <title>Synthesis and Diverse Transformations of a Dinitrogen Dititanium Hydride Complex Bearing Rigid Acridane&#8208;Based PNP&#8208;Pincer Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Ti, NN, Ti: A dinitrogen dititanium hydride complex bearing the rigid acridane&#8208;based acriPNP&#8208;pincer ligand undergoes diverse transformations with a variety of organometallic compounds. Many aspects of the dinitrogen reaction chemistry are thus revealed.







Abstract
Studies on N2 activation and transformation by transition metal hydride complexes are of particular interest and importance. The synthesis and diverse transformations of a dinitrogen dititanium hydride complex bearing the rigid acridane&#8208;based acriPNP&#8208;pincer ligands {[(acriPNP)Ti]2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;2&#8208;N2)(&#956;2&#8208;H)2} are presented. This complex enabled N2 cleavage and hydrogenation even without additional H2 or other reducing agents. Furthermore, diverse transformations of the N2 unit with a variety of organometallic compounds such as ZnMe2, MgMe2, AlMe3, B(C6F5)3, PinBH, and PhSiH3 have been well established at the rigid acriPNP&#8208;ligated dititanium framework, such as reversible bonding&#8208;mode change between the end&#8208;on and side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on fashions, diborylative N=N bond cleavage, the formal insertion of two dimethylaluminum species into the N=N bond, and the formal insertion of two silylene units into the N=N bond. This work has revealed many unprecedented aspects of dinitrogen reaction chemistry.

      <title>Concise, Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Enriched Graphene: Immobilization of Molecular Clusters and Battery Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The concise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;enriched&#8208;reduced graphene oxide (S&#8208;rGO), based on Lawesson's reagent, was achieved. Polyoxometalate (POM) clusters were individually immobilized on the S&#8208;rGO surface, and a lithium battery based on the POM and S&#8208;rGO complex exhibited high cycling stability for the charge&#8208;discharge process.







Abstract
The concise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;enriched graphene for battery applications is reported. The direct treatment of graphene oxide (GO) with the commercially available Lawesson's reagent produced sulfur&#8208;enriched&#8208;reduced GO (S&#8208;rGO). Various techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirmed the occurrence of both sulfur functionalization and GO reduction. Also fabricated was a nanohybrid material by using S&#8208;rGO with polyoxometalate (POM) as a cathode&#8208;active material for a rechargeable battery. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that POM clusters were individually immobilized on the S&#8208;rGO surface. This battery, based on a POM/S&#8208;rGO complex, exhibited greater cycling stability for the charge&#8208;discharge process than a battery with nanohybrid materials positioned between the POM and nonenriched rGO. These results demonstrate that the use of sulfur&#8208;containing groups on a graphene surface can be extended to applications such as the catalysis of electrochemical reactions and electrodes in other battery systems.

      <title>Melanin Biopolymers: Tailoring Chemical Complexity for Materials Design</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical complexity, emerging from structural disorder, redox behavior, and self&#8208;assembly, is nature's strategy to achieve multipurpose, adaptive, and tunable functionality in melanin biopolymers, which can be disentangled, modelled and rationally tailored to an expanding range of applications in materials science.







Abstract
Melanins, a group of dark insoluble pigments found widespread in nature, have become the focus of growing interest in materials science for various biomedical and technological applications, including opto&#8208;bioelectronics, nanomedicine and mussel&#8208;inspired surface coating. Recent progress in the understanding of melanin optical, paramagnetic redox, and conductivity properties, including photoconductivity, would point to a revision of the traditional concept of structural disorder in terms of more sophisticated and interrelated levels of chemical complexity which however have never been defined and codified. Herein, we bring to focus the various levels of structural disorder that emerged from spectral and chemical signatures over the past decade. A revised approach to structure&#8211;property relationships in terms of intermolecular interactions is also provided that may pave the way towards the rational design of next&#8208;generation melanin&#8208;based functional materials.

      <title>Design of Turn&#8208;On Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probes for Highly Sensitive and Selective Monitoring of Biopolymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly sensitive and selective turn&#8208;on near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probes for detection and monitoring of specific biopolymers can be designed based on aggregation/de&#8208;aggregation of phthalocyanine chromophores controlled by target binding. An EGFR tyrosine kinase sensor with a 3&#8197;nm limit of detection of the protein concentration is reported.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highly sensitive&lt;/b&gt; and selective turn&#8208;on near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probes for detection and monitoring of specific biopolymers can be designed based on aggregation/de&#8208;aggregation of phthalocyanine chromophores controlled by target binding. An EGFR tyrosine kinase sensor with a 3&#8197;n&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; limit of detection of the protein concentration is reported.

      <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Plasmonic Spiky Nanorods Increase the Elimination of Aging Cells in Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmonic core&#8211;shell spiky nanorods (CSNRs) modified with an anti&#8208;beta&#8208;2&#8208;microglobulin (aB2MG) antibody and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) were developed to target the mitochondria of senescent cells. Upon NIR&#8208;light irradiation, of CSNRs in mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, resulting in apoptosis of senescent cells. The immunologic adjuvant activity of CSNRs accelerates the clearance of these cells.







Abstract
Cellular senescence is stress&#8208;induced, irreversible growth arrest, and is thought to impair tissue function. The clearance of senescent cells can delay the features of senescence. Herein, we report the development of plasmonic core&#8211;shell spiky nanorods (CSNRs) surface&#8208;modified with an anti&#8208;beta&#8208;2&#8208;microglobulin (aB2MG) antibody and triphenylphosphonium (TPP), to target the mitochondria in senescent cells. aB2MG&#8208;TPP@CSNRs irradiated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light selectively caused mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of senescent cells with relatively low NIR light power, and the ability of CSNRs to activate and amplify the immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was discovered. The photo&#8208;induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in senescent&#8208;cell apoptosis and immune adjuvant effect by CSNRs accelerated the clearance of senescent cells in mice. This study opens the way for the use of precisely regulated plasmonic nanostructures for immune adjuvant and photo&#8208;induced apoptosis for age&#8208;related senescence.

Upon NIR&#8208;light irradiation, of CSNRs in mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, resulting in apoptosis of senescent cells. The immunologic adjuvant activity of CSNRs accelerates the clearance of these cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is stress&#8208;induced, irreversible growth arrest, and is thought to impair tissue function. The clearance of senescent cells can delay the features of senescence. Herein, we report the development of plasmonic core&#8211;shell spiky nanorods (CSNRs) surface&#8208;modified with an anti&#8208;beta&#8208;2&#8208;microglobulin (aB2MG) antibody and triphenylphosphonium (TPP), to target the mitochondria in senescent cells. aB2MG&#8208;TPP@CSNRs irradiated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light selectively caused mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of senescent cells with relatively low NIR light power, and the ability of CSNRs to activate and amplify the immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was discovered. The photo&#8208;induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in senescent&#8208;cell apoptosis and immune adjuvant effect by CSNRs accelerated the clearance of senescent cells in mice. This study opens the way for the use of precisely regulated plasmonic nanostructures for immune adjuvant and photo&#8208;induced apoptosis for age&#8208;related senescence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Active Electron Density Modulation of Co3O4&#8208;Based Catalysts Enhances their Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of precise and controllable methods for modulating the surface electronic properties and activity of catalysts is still a challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202001681), X. Xiao and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the surface active electron density of Co3O4 can be regulated by a novel argon&#8208;ion irradiation method, which leads a significantly enhanced absorption capability of the oxo group and exhibits great oxygen evolution reaction performance.

      <title>Synthesis of Small&#8208;Molecule Fluorescent Probes for the In&#8197;Vitro Imaging of Calcium&#8208;Activated Potassium Channel KCa3.1</title>
      <dc:description>
Imaging channels: Small&#8208;molecule probes for the in&#8197;vitro imaging of KCa3.1 channel&#8208;expressing cells were designed and developed. Using senicapoc as the targeting component, the BODIPY&#8208;labeled probes could selectively stain the channels in living cells and the channel punctate structure could be observed.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule probes for the in&#8197;vitro imaging of KCa3.1 channel&#8208;expressing cells were developed. Senicapoc, showing high affinity and selectivity for the KCa3.1 channels, was chosen as the targeting component. BODIPY dyes 15&#8211;20 were synthesized and connected by a CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne [3+2]cycloaddition with propargyl ether senicapoc derivative 8, yielding fluorescently labeled ligands 21&#8211;26. The dimethylpyrrole&#8208;based imaging probes 25 and 26 allow staining of KCa3.1 channels in NSCLC cells. The specificity was shown by removing the punctate staining pattern by pre&#8208;incubation with senicapoc. The density of KCa3.1 channels detected with 25 and by immunostaining was identical. The punctate structure of the labeled channels could also be observed in living cells. Molecular modeling showed binding of the senicapoc&#8208;targeting component towards the binding site within the ion channel and orientation of the linker with the dye along the inner surface of the ion channel.

      <title>Semi&#8208;Rationally Designed Short Peptides Self&#8208;Assemble and Bind Hemin to Promote Cyclopropanation</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalysis through self&#8208;assembly: Self&#8208;assembled nanostructures formed by semi&#8208;rationally designed seven&#8208;residue peptides and hemin catalyze the efficient formation of cyclopropanes in an enantioselective manner. The ease of peptide preparation also allows for straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the preparation of peptides made from d&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanoassemblies capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have semi&#8208;rationally designed a series of seven&#8208;residue peptides that form hemin&#8208;binding catalytic amyloids to facilitate enantioselective cyclopropanation with efficiencies that rival those of engineered hemin proteins. These results demonstrate that: 1)&#8197;Catalytic amyloids can bind complex metallocofactors to promote practically important multisubstrate transformations. 2)&#8197;Even essentially flat surfaces of amyloid assemblies can impart a substantial degree of enantioselectivity without the need for extensive optimization. 3)&#8197;The ease of peptide preparation allows for straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the preparation of peptides made from d&#8208;amino acids with complete reversal of enantioselectivity.

      <title>Programming the Nucleation of DNA Brick Self&#8208;Assembly with a Seeding Strand</title>
      <dc:description>
Seeds of construction: Through experimental studies and computer simulations, a seeded&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to control the crucial nucleation and assembly pathway in DNA brick assembly by accelerating the assembly kinetics, lowering the free&#8208;energy barrier to nucleation and increasing the optimal temperatures for isothermal assembly.







Abstract
Recently, the DNA brick strategy has provided a highly modular and scalable approach for the construction of complex structures, which can be used as nanoscale pegboards for the precise organization of molecules and nanoparticles for many applications. Despite the dramatic increase of structural complexity provided by the DNA brick method, the assembly pathways are still poorly understood. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;seed&#8221; strand to control the crucial nucleation and assembly pathway in DNA brick assembly. Through experimental studies and computer simulations, we successfully demonstrate that the regulation of the assembly pathways through seeded growth can accelerate the assembly kinetics and increase the optimal temperature by circa 4&#8211;7&#8201;&#176;C for isothermal assembly. By improving our understanding of the assembly pathways, we provide new guidelines for the design of programmable pathways to improve the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures.

      <title>Correlating Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Modulation with Linker Rotation in a Photoluminescent MOF</title>
      <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;induced bathochromic shifts in both fluorescence emission and UV/Vis absorption spectra of a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated Hf MOF are induced by rotation of the central phenyl ring of the linker. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction was measured up to 2.1&#8197;GPa, thus correlating linker rotation with modulation of emission.







Abstract
Conformational changes of linker units in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often responsible for gate&#8208;opening phenomena in selective gas adsorption and stimuli&#8208;responsive optical and electrical sensing behaviour. Herein, we show that pressure&#8208;induced bathochromic shifts in both fluorescence emission and UV/Vis absorption spectra of a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated Hf MOF, linked by 1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethynylbenzoate) ligands (Hf&#8208;peb), are induced by rotation of the central phenyl ring of the linker, from a coplanar arrangement to a twisted, previously unseen conformer. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, alongside in situ fluorescence and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopies, measured up to 2.1&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell on single crystals, are in excellent agreement, correlating linker rotation with modulation of emission. Topologically isolating the 1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethynylbenzoate) units within a MOF facilitates concurrent structural and spectroscopic studies in the absence of intermolecular perturbation, allowing characterisation of the luminescence properties of a high&#8208;energy, twisted conformation of the previously well&#8208;studied chromophore. We expect the unique environment provided by network solids, and the capability of combining crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis, will greatly enhance understanding of luminescent molecules and lead to the development of novel sensors and adsorbents.

&lt;p&gt;Poly(2&#8208;oxazolines) (POXs) were employed as a new class of host defense peptide mimics. As reported by R. Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200050510.1002/anie.202000505&lt;/a&gt;), these functional peptide mimics show potent in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity against methicillin&#8208;resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) while alleviating antibiotic resistance and killing antibiotic&#8208;tolerant MRSA persisters through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent mechanism.

      <title>Double&#8208;Gyroid Nanostructure Formation by Aggregation&#8208;Induced Atropisomerization and Co&#8208;Assembly of Ionic Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Amphiphiles</title>
      <dc:description>
With both hands: A new molecular&#8208;design principle for creating double&#8208;gyroid nanostructured molecular assemblies based on atropisomerization is reported. Ionic amphiphiles with rotationally restricted imidazolium rings are used. Three stable atropisomers co&#8208;organize into bicontinuous cubic liquid&#8208;crystalline mesophases through nanosegregation of the ionic and non&#8208;ionic parts.







Abstract
We report a new molecular&#8208;design principle for creating double&#8208;gyroid nanostructured molecular assemblies based on atropisomerization. Ionic amphiphiles containing two imidazolium rings close to each other were designed and synthesized. NMR data revealed that the rotation of the imidazolium rings is restricted, with an activation energy as high as 63&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in DMSO&#8208;d6 solution (DFT prediction for a model compound in the vacuum: 90&#8211;100&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Due to the restricted rotation, the amphiphiles feature &#8220;double&#8221; atropisomeric axes in their ionic segments and form three stable atropisomers: meso, R, and S. These isomers co&#8208;organize into 
&#8208;type bicontinuous cubic liquid&#8208;crystalline mesophases through nanosegregation of the ionic and non&#8208;ionic parts. Considering the intrinsic characteristic of 
&#8208;type bicontinuous cubic structures that they are composed of intertwined right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed single gyroids, we propose that the simultaneous presence of both R&#8208; and S&#8208;atropisomers is an important contributor to the formation of double&#8208;gyroid structures.

      <dc:description>
Like a tightly pulled loop in a rope, cyclic vinyl boronate complexes can undergo a ring contraction concomitant with an increase in strain when reacting with electrophilic radicals generated by visible light. As V.&#8197;K. Aggarwal et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201915409), a variety of cyclobutyl boronic esters can be obtained in high yields and with excellent stereocontrol. This includes compounds containing contiguous quaternary stereocenters and also benzofused cyclobutenes, which are substaintially more strained.

      <title>Bioinspired and Mechanically Strong Fibers Based on Engineered Non&#8208;Spider Chimeric Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanically strong biological fibers have been produced using a novel chimeric protein. In stark contrast to traditional polymer fibers, these fibers combine high strength and high toughness. The fibers exhibit a breaking strength up to about 630&#8197;MPa and the toughness is as high as about 130&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3, making them superior to many recombinant spider silks and even comparable to some native counterparts.







Abstract
Silk&#8208;protein&#8208;based fibers have attracted considerable interest due to their low weight and extraordinary mechanical properties. Most studies on fibrous proteins focus on the recombinant spidroins, but these fibers exhibit moderate mechanical performance. Thus, the development of alternative structural proteins for the construction of robust fibers is an attractive goal. Herein, we report a class of biological fibers produced using a designed chimeric protein, which consists of the sequences of a cationic elastin&#8208;like polypeptide and a squid ring teeth protein. Remarkably, the chimeric protein fibers exhibit a breaking strength up to about 630&#8197;MPa and a corresponding toughness as high as about 130&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3, making them superior to many recombinant spider silks and even comparable to some native counterparts. Therefore, this strategy is a novel concept for exploring bioinspired ultrastrong protein materials through the development of new types of structural chimeric proteins.

The apex of the volcano curve, where the most active electrocatalysts are situated, is commonly defined by a hypothetical ideal material that binds its reaction intermediates thermoneutral at zero overpotential, in correspondence to Sabatier&#8217;s principle.

The second phosphorescent emitter, Pt(OEP), absorbs the light&#8208;beam of 532 nm and visibly phosphoresces only in the deoxygenated zone generated by the first sensitizer. The phosphorescent voxels, 3D images, and animations are well&#8208;defined by the intersections of the 635 and 532 nm light&#8208;beams that are programmable by tuning of excitation power densities, the beam shapes and kinetics. As a pivotal selection rule for the phosphorescent molecular couple used in this 3D displaying system, their absorptions and emissions must be orthogonal to each other, so that they can be excited and addressed independently.</dc:description>

In this work, we report the first unsymmetrically substituted dicationic diboranes, featuring sp  2  &#8208;sp  2  &#8208;hybridized boron atoms. The compounds are formed by intramolecular rearrangement from preceeding isomeric symmetrically substituted dicationic diboranes, a process that is catalysed by nucleophiles. From the temperature&#8208;dependence of the isomerization rate, activation parameters for this unprecedented rearrangement are derived. The difference in fluoride ion affinity between the two boron atoms and the bonding situation in these unique unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are evaluated.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Controlled Construction of Hierarchical Supramolecular Chiral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymer Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Hierarchical supramolecular chiral liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer assemblies are highly challenging to construct in situ in a controlled manner. Here, we report polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) for the first time, by which hierarchical supramolecular chiral azobenzene&#8208;containing block copolymer (Azo&#8208;BCP) assemblies were constructed in a controlled manner, not only for different morphologies but also for chiroptical properties, with &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions occurring in the layered structure of Azo smectic phases. The evolution of chirality from terminal alkyl chain to Azo mesogen building blocks and further induction of supramolecular chirality in BCP liquid&#8208;crystalline assemblies during PICSA process is achieved. A full spectrum of morphologies spanning spheres, worms, helical fibers, lamellae and vesicles were observed and the morphological transition had a crucial effect on the chiral expression of Azo&#8208;BCP assemblies. The supramolecular chirality of Azo&#8208;BCP assemblies destroyed by 365 nm UV light irradiation can be fully recovered by heating&#8208;cooling treatment and this dynamic reversible achiral&#8208;chiral switch can be repeated at least five times. The PICSA process provides a novel platform for effectively producing photoresponsive hierarchical supramolecular chiral polymer assemblies in situ with various morphologies in a well&#8208;controlled manner.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoenzymatic Hydrogenation of Heteroaromatic Olefins using &#8216;Ene&#8217;&#8208;Reductases with Photoredox Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent &#8216;ene&#8217;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) are highly selective catalysts for the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. This function is, however, limited to enones, enoates, and nitroalkenes using the native hydride transfer mechanism. Here we demonstrate that EREDs can reduce vinyl pyridines when irradiated with visible light in the presence of a photoredox catalyst. Experimental evidence suggests the reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism where the vinyl pyridine is reduced to the corresponding neutral benzylic radical in solution. DFT calculations reveal this radical to be &#8220;dynamically stable&#8221;, suggesting it is sufficiently long lived to diffuse into the enzyme active site for stereoselective hydrogen atom transfer.

      <title>Bad Vibrations? Exploring the vibrational side of spin&#8208;phonon coupling in SMMs via 161Dy Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Synchrotron based Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy (NRVS) using the M&#246;ssbauer isotope&#160;  161  Dy has been employed for the first time to study the vibrational properties of a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) incorporating Dy(III), namely [Dy(Cy  3  PO)  2  (H  2  O)  5  ]Br  3  &#183;2(Cy  3  PO)&#183;2H  2  O&#183;2EtOH. The experimental partial phonon density of states (pDOS) which includes all vibrational modes involving a displacement of the Dy(III) ion, was reproduced by means of simulations using density functional theory (DFT), enabling the assignment of all intramolecular vibrational modes. This study proves that  161  Dy NRVS is a powerful experimental tool with significant potential to help to clarify the role of phonons in SMMs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Scalable solar hydrogen production via water splitting using particulate photocatalysts holds great promise for renewable energy utilization.

We found that well&#8208;defined BiVO  4  crystals with precisely tuned {110}/{010} facets are ideal photocatalysts to realize the HFP, giving up to 71% quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water oxidation and full forward reaction with nearly no reverse reaction. An overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical efficiency over 1.9% and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency exceeding 1.8% could be achieved.

      <title>An Efficient Method for the Programmed Synthesis of Multifunctional Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>
A new and powerful approach for the synthesis of diketopyrrolopyrroles bearing electron&#8208;donating and sterically&#8208;hindered substituents has been developed. This method allows for the regioselective installation of C&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl substituents in a predictable and programmed manner. Unprecedented control over the optical properties of DPP derivatives has been demonstrated by the creation of a large series of dipolar DPPs, some bearing previously inaccessible substituents.







Abstract
A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrroles from aldehydes, primary amines, nitriles, and diethyl oxalacetate has been developed. It is now possible to prepare diketopyrrolopyrroles bearing an ordered arrangement of three different substituents from abundant and commercially available materials, allowing the independent regulation of all desired physicochemical properties. For the first time very electron&#8208;rich (carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl, dimethylaminophenyl, pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolyl), and sterically hindered substituents (naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl, quinolin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, acridin&#8208;9&#8208;yl, imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;yl, 2&#8208;bromophenyl etc.) can be appended to the diketopyrrolopyrrole core by condensation of an appropriate nitrile with a pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. Even greater synthetic possibilities are related to the fact that such demanding substituents as 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl, indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl, and 2&#8208;methoxyphenyl can be incorporated from aldehyde precursors, bypassing problems with the nitriles reactivity.

Even greater synthetic possibilities are related to the fact that such demanding substituents as 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl, indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl, and 2&#8208;methoxyphenyl can be incorporated from aldehyde precursors, bypassing problems with the nitriles reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modular Synthesis of Nona&#8208;Decasaccharide Motif from Psidium guajava Polysaccharides: Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
A nona&#8208;decasaccharide from Psidium guajava polysaccharides has been prepared in a modular one&#8208;pot approach. The strategy features: 1)&#8197;several one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions on the basis of N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates (PTFAI) and Yu glycosylation, 2)&#8197;the assembly sequences toward the 2,3,5&#8208;highly branched Araf motif, 3)&#8197;the stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosylation, and 4)&#8197;a final, convergent [6+6+7] one&#8208;pot coupling reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis of long, branched, and complex carbohydrate sequences remains a challenging task in chemical synthesis. Reported here is an efficient and modular one&#8208;pot synthesis of a nona&#8208;decasaccharide and shorter sequences from Psidium guajava polysaccharides, which have the potent &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitory activity. The synthetic strategy features: 1)&#8197;several one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions on the basis of N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidate (PTFAI) and Yu glycosylation to streamline the chemical synthesis of oligosaccharides, 2)&#8197;the successful and efficient assembly sequences (first O3&#8242;, second O5&#8242;, final O2&#8242;) toward the challenging 2,3,5&#8208;branched Araf motif, 3)&#8197;the stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosylation by reagent control, and 4)&#8197;the convergent [6+6+7] one&#8208;pot coupling reaction for the final assembly of the target nona&#8208;decasaccharide. This orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy can streamline the chemical synthesis of long, branched, and complicated carbohydrate chains.

Here, we report how thiophene&#8208;based trimeric structures with naphthoquinone or hydroquinone redox&#8208;active pendent groups can be processed in solution, deposited, dried and subsequently polymerized in solid state to form conductive (redox) polymer layers without any additives.

By employing these materials as anode and cathode in an acidic aqueous electrolyte a rocking&#8208;chair proton battery is built. The battery shows good cycling stability (85% after 500 cycles), withstands rapid charging, with full capacity (60 mAh/g) reached within 100 seconds, allows for direct integration with photovoltaics, and retains its favorable characteristics even at &#8208;24 &#176;C.</dc:description>

Abstract
A unique nickel/organic photoredox co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;chloro esters and aryl iodides is developed. This cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction employs an organic reductant (Hantzsch ester), whereas most reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions use stoichiometric metals. A diverse array of valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl esters is formed under these conditions with high enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 88&#8201;%). &#945;&#8208;Aryl esters represent an important family of nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. This novel synergistic strategy expands the scope of Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Hierarchical Hollow CoP@C Composites with Superior Performance for Sodium and Potassium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical hollow CoP and carbon composites were obtained through a facile one&#8208;step synthesis. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of conductive carbon layer and hierarchical hollow structure, the as&#8208;prepared CoP@C composites demonstrate superior sodium and potassium storage capability as anode materials for rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Hierarchical hollow CoP and carbon composites were obtained through a facile synthetic method, where carbonization and phosphorization of the precursor were completed within one single step. The composites are composed of hollow CoP@C spheres, which are further made up of CoP nanoparticles with a thin outer carbon layer. Electrochemical performances of the prepared CoP@C composites as anodes for sodium and potassium storage were evaluated and compared. In&#8197;situ TEM, in&#8197;situ synchrotron XRD, and DFT calculations were conducted to study the structural evolution and the interaction between Na/K and CoP during cycling processes. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of conductive carbon layer and hierarchical hollow structure, the as&#8208;prepared CoP@C composites demonstrate superior sodium and potassium storage capability as anode materials for rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Tuning Cellular Biological Functions Through the Controlled Release of NO from a Porous Ti&#8208;MOF</title>
      <dc:description>
NO limit: The delivery of nitric oxide with a new titanium metal&#8211;organic framework allows the control of biological functions of cells, due to its adsorption/release mechanism based on the formation of nitrites bound to the titanium sites. The high storage capacity, biocompatibility and slow release and stability in biological media, render this material an exceptional vehicle for nitric oxide delivery.







Abstract
Materials for the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO) are of interest for therapeutic applications. However, to date, many suffer from toxicity and stability issues, as well as poor performance. Herein, we propose a new NO adsorption/release mechanism through the formation of nitrites on the skeleton of a titanium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that we named MIP&#8208;177, featuring a suitable set of properties for such an application: (i) high NO storage capacity (3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mg&#8722;1solid), (ii) excellent biocompatibility at therapeutic relevant concentrations (no cytotoxicity at 90&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for wound healing) due to its high stability in biological media (&lt;9&#8201;% degradation in 72&#8197;hours) and (iii) slow NO release in biological media (&#8776;2&#8197;hours for 90&#8201;% release). The prospective application of MIP&#8208;177 is demonstrated through NO&#8208;driven control of mitochondrial respiration in cells and stimulation of cell migration, paving the way for the design of new NO delivery systems for wound healing therapy.

      <title>Molecular Porous Photosystems Tailored for Long&#8208;Term Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers were used as photosystems to deliver a constant production rate for the CO2 to formate reduction for several days. Their photoactivation pathway is presented, including an ultrafast electronic energy transfer from the photosensitizer to the catalyst as evidenced by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations.







Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level structuration of two full photosystems into conjugated porous organic polymers is reported. The strategy of heterogenization gives rise to photosystems which are still fully active after 4&#8197;days of continuous illumination. Those materials catalyze the carbon dioxide photoreduction driven by visible light to produce up to three grams of formate per gram of catalyst. The covalent tethering of the two active sites into a single framework is shown to play a key role in the visible light activation of the catalyst. The unprecedented long&#8208;term efficiency arises from an optimal photoinduced electron transfer from the light harvesting moiety to the catalytic site as anticipated by quantum mechanical calculations and evidenced by in situ ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy.

      <title>Tunable Periodically Ordered Mesoporosity in Palladium Membranes Enables Exceptional Enhancement of Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity for Formic Acid Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Formic and function: A palladium catalyst with periodically ordered mesoporosity is realized by asymmetrically replicating the bicontinuous cubic phase of a lyotropic liquid crystal. In formic acid oxidation electrocatalysis the optimized catalyst delivering 7.8&#8197;times the catalytic current of commercial Pd/C.







Abstract
Developing superior electrocatalysts for formic acid oxidation (FAO) is the most crucial step in commercializing direct formic acid fuel cells. Herein, we electrodeposited palladium membranes with periodically ordered mesoporosity obtained by asymmetrically replicating the bicontinuous cubic phase structure of a lyotropic liquid&#8208;crystal template. The Pd membrane with the largest periodicity and highest degree of order delivered up to 90.5&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of electrochemical active surface area and 3.34&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 electrocatalysis capability towards FAO, 3.8 and 7.8 times the values of the commercial Pd/C catalyst, respectively. By controlling the temperature and potential of the electrodeposition procedure, the periodicity area and order degree of the mesoporosity are highly tunable. These Pd membranes gave prototype formic acid fueled cells with 4.3 and 2.4 times the maximum current and power density of the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Native S&#8208;Palmitoylated Membrane Proteins through Removable&#8208;Backbone&#8208;Modification&#8208;Assisted Ser/Thr Ligation</title>
      <dc:description>
Native proteins by non&#8208;native methods: An RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL strategy (removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted serine/threonine ligation) was developed for the chemical synthesis of native S&#8208;palmitoylated membrane proteins, which have not previously been accessible through chemical synthesis. The successful synthesis of S&#8208;palmitoylated sarcolipin and M2 demonstrates the importance of non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.







Abstract
The preparation of native S&#8208;palmitoylated (S&#8208;palm) membrane proteins is one of the unsolved challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, we report the first chemical synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins by removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted Ser/Thr ligation (RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL). This method involves two critical steps: 1)&#8197;synthesis of S&#8208;palm peptides by a new &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid based RBM (RBMGABA) strategy, and 2)&#8197;ligation of the S&#8208;palm RBM&#8208;modified peptides to give the desired S&#8208;palm product by the STL method. The utility of the RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL method was demonstrated by the synthesis of rabbit S&#8208;palm sarcolipin (SLN) and S&#8208;palm matrix&#8208;2 (M2) ion channel. The synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins highlights the importance of developing non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.

      <title>Magnifying the Structural Components of Biomembranes: A Prototype for the Study of the Self&#8208;Assembly of Giant Lipids</title>
      <dc:description>
The bigger the better: Two categories of giant, lipid&#8208;like amphiphilic molecules organize into various mesostructures, shedding new light on the underlying principles of lipid self&#8208;assembly. The geometric parameters of these giant, lipid&#8208;like molecules are modulated on a molecular level to understand the physiochemical driving forces behind their self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
How biomembranes are self&#8208;organized to perform their functions remains a pivotal issue in biological and chemical science. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly principles of lipid&#8208;like molecules hence becomes crucial. Herein, we report the mesostructural evolution of amphiphilic sphere&#8208;rod conjugates (giant lipids), and study the roles of geometric parameters (head&#8211;tail ratio and cross&#8208;sectional area) during this course. As a prototype system, giant lipids resemble natural lipidic molecules by capturing their essential features. The self&#8208;assembly behavior of two categories of giant lipids (I&#8208;shape and T&#8208;shape, a total of 8 molecules) is demonstrated. A rich variety of mesostructures is constructed in solution state and their molecular packing models are rationally understood. Giant lipids recast the phase behavior of natural lipids to a certain degree and the abundant self&#8208;assembled morphologies reveal distinct physiochemical behaviors when geometric parameters deviate from natural analogues.

      <title>Multivariate Modulation of the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 for Defect&#8208;Controlled Combination Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Multivariate modulation: Inclusion of multiple modulators into one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of MOFs yields UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles with three drugs loaded at defect sites throughout the structure, yet still sufficient porosity to postsynthetically store a fourth, selectivity&#8208;enhancing, anticancer drug.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as leading candidates for nanoscale drug delivery, as a consequence of their high drug capacities, ease of functionality, and the ability to carefully engineer key physical properties. Despite many anticancer treatment regimens consisting of a cocktail of different drugs, examples of delivery of multiple drugs from one MOF are rare, potentially hampered by difficulties in postsynthetic loading of more than one cargo molecule. Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination to the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.

      <title>Light&#8208;Controllable Ionic Conductivity in a Polymeric Ionic Liquid</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive PILs: Polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) materials based on diarylethene units have been designed to undergo a light&#8208;mediated change in conductivity. Key to this modulation is a change in the cationic character of the imidazolium bridging unit upon photoswitching. Irradiation with UV light triggers a 70&#8201;% drop in conductivity in the solid state, which can be recovered upon subsequent irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) have attracted considerable attention as electrolytes with high stability and mechanical durability. Light&#8208;responsive materials are enabling for a variety of future technologies owing to their remote and noninvasive manipulation, spatiotemporal control, and low environmental impact. To address this potential, responsive PIL materials based on diarylethene units were designed to undergo light&#8208;mediated conductivity changes. Key to this modulation is tuning of the cationic character of the imidazolium bridging unit upon photoswitching. Irradiation of these materials with UV light triggers a circa 70&#8201;% drop in conductivity in the solid state that can be recovered upon subsequent irradiation with visible light. This light&#8208;responsive ionic conductivity enables spatiotemporal and reversible patterning of PIL films using light. This modulation of ionic conductivity allows for the development of light&#8208;controlled electrical circuits and wearable photodetectors.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Assisted Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroarylation of Allenoates</title>
      <dc:description>
Leading light: A regio&#8208; and stereoselective fluoroarylation of allenic esters through visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted gold redox catalysis with cost&#8208;effective Et3N&#8901;3&#8201;HF as the nucleophilic fluorine source is reported. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal concomitant activation of the allene motif by a high&#8208;valent gold complex and the hydrogen fluoride by hydrogen bonding with the ester group, thereby enabling the otherwise challenging fluorine incorporation.







Abstract
A strategically novel synthetic method for the fluoroarylation of allenic ester was developed that enables the expedient construction of a host of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing cinnamate derivatives. The reaction proceeds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted gold redox catalysis, occurs smoothly under very mild reaction conditions, accommodates a large variety of functional groups, and more importantly allows the incorporation of fluorine and aryl groups with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The concomitant activation mode for both the allene motif and the hydrogen fluoride is key for the success of the reaction.

      <title>Excited&#8208;State Aromaticity of Gold(III) Hexaphyrins and Metalation Effect Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
The aromaticity reversal in the excited&#8208;state of gold&#8208;coordinated hexaphyrins is revealed by vibrational and electronic structure analyses. The structural changes driven by the aromaticity reversal, and the corresponding inverted electronic structures, were also detected.







Abstract
Expanded porphyrins with appropriate metalation provide an excellent opportunity to study excited&#8208;state aromaticity. The coordinated metal allows the excited&#8208;state aromaticity in the triplet state to be detected through the heavy&#8208;atom effect, but other metalation effects on the excited&#8208;state aromaticity were ambiguous. Herein, the excited&#8208;state aromaticity of gold(III) hexaphyrins through the relaxation dynamics was revealed via electronic and vibrational spectroscopy. The SQ states of gold [26]&#8208; and [28]&#8208;hexaphyrins showed interconvertible absorption and IR spectra with those of counterparts in the ground&#8208;state, indicating aromaticity reversal. Furthermore, while the T1 states of gold [28]&#8208;hexaphyrins also exhibited reversed aromaticity according to Baird's rule, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer state of gold [26]&#8208;hexaphyrins contributed by the gold metal showed non&#8208;aromatic features arising from the odd&#8208;number of &#960;&#8208;electrons.

      <title>Arsenene: A Potential Therapeutic Agent for Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Cells by Acting on Nuclear Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Course of action: Arsenene nanosheets have been shown to have potent antiproliferative activity against a variety of cancer cells, especially NB4 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells, while showing no toxicity towards normal cells. A mechanistic study in NB4 cells revealed that arsenene induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potentials, thereby leading to apoptosis of the cells.







Abstract
Arsenene has recently emerged as a promising new two&#8208;dimensional material for biomedical applications because of its excellent optical and electronic properties. Herein, novel 2D arsenene nanosheets were synthesized and shown to be effective against NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells (82&#8201;% inhibition) as well as inducing apoptosis while showing no toxicity towards normal cells. The high zeta potential, small size, and the planar structure were crucial to the toxicity of the materials. Label&#8208;free proteomic profiling analysis suggested that arsenene affected nuclear DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and pyrimidine metabolism pathways by downregulating the DNA polymerases POLE, POLD1, POLD2, and POLD3. Mass spectrometric studies showed that arsenene bound mainly to nuclear nucleotide acid binding proteins in NB4 cells and further cellular fluorescence studies revealed that the arsenene destroyed the nuclei. In&#8197;vivo toxicity tests in mice also indicated the physiological biosafety of arsenene.

      <title>Anti&#8208;Aromatic versus Induced Paratropicity: Synthesis and Interrogation of a Dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene with a Proton Placed Directly above the Central Ring</title>
      <dc:description>
An oxidative coupling within a diazadioxa[10]helicene gives a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene, with a proton from a pendant naphthalene moiety centred directly above the central nine&#8208;membered ring. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis revealed that this distinct environment induces a significant magnetic deshielding effect on that particular proton.







Abstract
We present a high&#8208;yielding intramolecular oxidative coupling within a diazadioxa[10]helicene to give a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene. This is the first [n]circulene containing more than eight ortho&#8208;annulated rings (n&gt;8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals a tight columnar packing, with a proton from a pendant naphthalene moiety centred directly above the central nine&#8208;membered ring. This distinct environment induces a significant magnetic deshielding effect on that particular proton as determined by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The origin of the deshielding effect was investigated computationally in terms of the NICS values. It is established that the deshielding effect originates from an induced paratropic ring current from the seven aromatic rings of the [9]circulene structure, and is not due to the nine&#8208;membered ring being antiaromatic. UV/Vis spectroscopy reveals more efficient conjugation in the prepared diazatrioxa[9]circulene compared to the parent helical azaoxa[10]helicenes, and DFT calculations, including energy levels, confirm the experimental observations.

      <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Harvesting from Arid Air with Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Modified by Hygroscopic Salt</title>
      <dc:description>
A composite sorbent for efficient water harvesting from dry air is prepared by confining a hygroscopic salt in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix (LiCl@MIL&#8208;101(Cr)). This composite sorbent works efficiently under outdoor ambient conditions powered by natural sunlight without additional energy input.







Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge threatening human survival, especially for people living in arid regions. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is an appealing way to solve this problem. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AWH technologies have poor water harvesting performance in arid climates owing to the low water sorption capacity of common sorbents under low humidity conditions. We report a high&#8208;performance composite sorbent for efficient water harvesting from arid air by confining hygroscopic salt in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix (LiCl@MIL&#8208;101(Cr)). The composite sorbent shows 0.77&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water sorption capacity at 1.2&#8197;kPa vapor pressure (30&#8201;% relative humidity at 30&#8201;&#176;C) by integrating the multi&#8208;step sorption processes of salt chemisorption, deliquescence, and solution absorption. A highly efficient AWH prototype is demonstrated with LiCl@MIL&#8208;101(Cr) that can enable the harvesting of 0.45&#8211;0.7&#8197;kg water per kilogram of material under laboratory and outdoor ambient conditions powered by natural sunlight without optical concentration and additional energy input.

      <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst as an Efficient Multiple Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Scavenger for Sepsis Management</title>
      <dc:description>
Better than nanozymes: By mimicking triple antioxidant enzymes, conducting an oxidative&#8208;reduction cycle, and formation of a nitrosyl&#8211;metal complex, an enzyme&#8208;mimicking single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAzyme) can quickly obliterate multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels to alleviate sepsis.







Abstract
Sepsis, characterized by immoderate production of multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), causes high morbidity and mortality. Despite progress made with nanozymes, efficient antioxidant therapy to eliminate these RONS remains challenging, owing largely to the specificity and low activity of exploited nanozymes. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;mimicking single&#8208;atom catalyst, Co/PMCS, features atomically dispersed coordinatively unsaturated active Co&#8208;porphyrin centers, which can rapidly obliterate multiple RONS to alleviate sepsis. Co/PMCS can eliminate O2.&#8722; and H2O2 by mimicking superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, while removing .OH via the oxidative&#8208;reduction cycle, with markedly higher activity than nanozymes. It can also scavenge .NO through formation of a nitrosyl&#8211;metal complex. Eventually, it can reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, protect organs from damage, and confer a distinct survival advantage to the infected sepsis mice.

      <title>Multicomponent Peptide Stapling as a Diversity&#8208;Driven Tool for the Development of Inhibitors of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
An effective strategy for the development of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides through Ugi stapling is described. Highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53 is shown based on three biorthogonal assays, for example, fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis, and 2D NMR. Additionally, several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained.







Abstract
Stapled peptides are chemical entities in&#8208;between biologics and small molecules, which have proven to be the solution to high affinity protein&#8211;protein interaction antagonism, while keeping control over pharmacological performance such as stability and membrane penetration. We demonstrate that the multicomponent reaction&#8208;based stapling is an effective strategy for the development of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides with highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53. Such a potent inhibitory activity of p53&#8208;MDM2/X interactions was assessed by fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis, and 2D NMR, while several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained. This MCR stapling protocol proved efficient and versatile in terms of diversity generation at the staple, as evidenced by the incorporation of both exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;cyclic hydrophobic moieties at the side chain cross&#8208;linkers. The interaction of the Ugi&#8208;staple fragments with the target protein was demonstrated by crystallography.

      <title>Designing a 0D/2D S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction over Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Inactivation of Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
A 0D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material involving CeO2 quantum dots and polymeric carbon nitride (CeO2/PCN) was designed and constructed. This heterojunction material has a high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1&#8201;%) towards Staphylococcus aureus under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Constructing heterojunctions between two semiconductors with matched band structure is an effective strategy to acquire high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction system has shown great potential in facilitating separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, as well as acquiring strong photoredox ability. Herein, a 0D/2D S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction material involving CeO2 quantum dots and polymeric carbon nitride (CeO2/PCN) is designed and constructed by in&#8197;situ wet chemistry with subsequent heat treatment. This S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material shows high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1&#8201;%) towards Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm), which is 2.7 and 8.2 times that of pure CeO2 (32.2&#8201;%) and PCN (10.7&#8201;%), respectively. Strong evidence of S&#8208;scheme charge transfer path is verified by theoretical calculations, in&#8197;situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance.

      <title>Unprecedented Sequence Control and Sequence&#8208;Driven Properties in a Series of AB&#8208;Alternating Copolymers Consisting Solely of Acrylamide Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units have been produced. Crucial to realizing this unprecedented polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer carrying two activated ester bonds to allow &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization and aminolysis. Some of the alternating copolyacrylamides exhibit unique properties compared to the random copolymers in solution and in the bulk state.







Abstract
Herein, we report a method to synthesize a series of alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units. Crucial to realizing this polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer that contains acrylate and acrylamide moieties connected by two activated ester bonds. This design, which is based on the reactivity ratio of the embedded vinyl groups, allows a &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization, wherein the intramolecular and intermolecular propagation are repeated alternately under dilute conditions. The addition of an amine to the resulting cyclopolymers afforded two different acryl amide units, i.e., an amine&#8208;substituted acryl amide and a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ethyl&#8208;substituted acryl amide in alternating sequence. Using this method, we could furnish ten types of alternating copolymers; some of these exhibit unique properties in solution and in the bulk, which are different from those of the corresponding random copolymers, and we attributed the differences to the alternating sequence.

      <title>Amide Synthesis by Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Carbamoylation of (Hetero)Aryl Bromides</title>
      <dc:description>
Teaming up for amide synthesis: A catalytic method for amide synthesis is detailed that proceeds at ambient temperature and enables the direct carbamoylation of (hetero)aryl bromides. This method is based on the combination of nickel and photoredox catalysis and uses readily available dihydropyridines as precursors of carbamoyl radicals.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;electron strategy for catalytic amide synthesis that enables the direct carbamoylation of (hetero)aryl bromides. This radical cross&#8208;coupling approach, which is based on the combination of nickel and photoredox catalysis, proceeds at ambient temperature and uses readily available dihydropyridines as precursors of carbamoyl radicals. The method's mild reaction conditions make it tolerant of sensitive&#8208;functional&#8208;group&#8208;containing substrates and allow the installation of an amide scaffold within biologically relevant heterocycles. In addition, we installed amide functionalities bearing electron&#8208;poor and sterically hindered amine moieties, which would be difficult to prepare with classical dehydrative condensation methods.

      <title>Living Supramolecular Polymerization of an Aza&#8208;BODIPY Dye Controlled by a Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Accepting Triazole Unit Introduced by Click Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
aza&#8208;BODIPY comes alive! Living supramolecular polymerization was demonstrated by aza&#8208;BODIPY 1 bearing hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting triazole units that can be facilely constructed through click chemistry. The H&#8208;bonding unit of amide&#8208;linked triazole in dye 1 could be employed as a general motif for encoding conformational information and developing polymorphic supramolecular systems.







Abstract
An aza&#8208;BODIPY dye 1 bearing two hydrophobic fan&#8208;shaped tridodecyloxybenzamide pendants through 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linkages was synthesized by a click reaction and characterized. 1H&#8197;NMR studies indicated that dye 1 exhibited variable conformations through intramolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction, which is beneficial for the polymorphism of aggregation. The thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic aspect of the supramolecular polymerization of dye 1 was investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, AFM, TEM, and SEM. Biphasic aggregation pathways of dye 1, leads to the formation of off&#8208;pathway, metastable Agg.&#8197;I and thermodynamically stable Agg.&#8197;II with distinct H&#8208;aggregation spectra and nanoscale morphology. The living manner of the supramolecular polymerization of dye 1 was demonstrated in seeded polymerization experiments with temperature&#8208;modulated successive cooling&#8211;heating cycles.

      <title>Acid Exfoliation of Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Solution Processing into Crystalline Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Film star: Covalent organic frameworks are promising candidates for applications such as charge&#8208;storage devices, nanofiltration membranes, and optoelectronic devices.

Acid exfoliation enables the scalable conversion of imine&#8208;linked COF powders into the more desirable thin&#8208;film morphology.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly modular porous crystalline polymers that are of interest for applications such as charge&#8208;storage devices, nanofiltration membranes, and optoelectronic devices. COFs are typically synthesized as microcrystalline powders, which limits their performance in these applications, and their limited solubility precludes large&#8208;scale processing into more useful morphologies and devices. We report a general, scalable method to exfoliate two&#8208;dimensional imine&#8208;linked COF powders by temporarily protonating their linkages. The resulting suspensions were cast into continuous crystalline COF films up to 10&#8197;cm in diameter, with thicknesses ranging from 50&#8197;nm to 20&#8197;&#956;m depending on the suspension composition, concentration, and casting protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the film fabrication process proceeds through a partial depolymerization/repolymerization mechanism, providing mechanically robust films that can be easily separated from their substrates.

X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an indispensable technique in modern materials science. A literature survey reveals that in the vast majority of cases an incorrect referencing of the binding energy scale is used, neglecting warnings that have been formulated from the early days of the technique. The purpose of this Viewpoint is to highlight the existing problems and suggest ways forward.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an indispensable technique in modern materials science for the determination of chemical bonding as evidenced by more than 10&#8201;000 XPS papers published annually. A literature survey reveals that in the vast majority of cases an incorrect referencing of the binding energy scale is used, neglecting warnings that have been formulated from the early days of the technique. Consequences for the data reliability are disastrous and decades of XPS work require revisiting. The purpose of this Viewpoint is to highlight the existing problems, review the criticism and suggest ways forward.

      <dc:description>
The selective N&#8208;acylation of glucosamine with unprotected carboxylic acids enables the biosynthesis of unnatural glycosides and their subsequent enzymatic modification. In their Communication on page&#8197;5308, L. Liu, S.&#8197;L. Flitsch, J. Voglmeir et&#8197;al. report that the enzyme chitobiose deacetylase from Cyclobacterium marinum has promiscuous N&#8208;acylation activity without the need for activation of the acid. This selective N&#8208;acylation step provides the last missing link for the fully enzymatic multistep synthesis of C5&#8208;modified sialosides from chitin.

      <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between discrete co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide (NDI) units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI were modulated by changes in temperature and solvent polarity. As M. Takeuchi et&#8197;al. report in their Communication page&#8197;5254, the tuning of through&#8208;space electronic communication through the conformational transformation between monomer&#8208; and dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI resulted in a highly sensitive and reversible optical response over a wide range of temperatures.

Heterobifunctional rotaxanes serve as catalysts for the addition of malonates to Michael acceptors. In their Research Article on page&#8197;5102, J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al. report a series of heterobifunctional rotaxanes, featuring an amine&#8208;based thread and a chiral phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based macrocycle. Rational catalyst improvements aided by high&#8208;level DFT calculations led to interlocked catalysts that surpass their non&#8208;interlocked counterparts in terms of reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

      <title>Deracemization Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited deracemization: Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been utilized to convert racemates into single enantiomers in the presence of a chiral photosensitizer or a pair of chiral catalysts. Mechanistic studies revealed that energy transfer (EnT) or a sequence of electron transfer (ET), proton transfer (PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is operative.







Abstract
Deracemization is an ideal but challenging strategy for the conversion of a racemic mixture into a single enantiomer. Recent studies have demonstrated that visible&#8208;light photocatalysis could be utilized to promote selective deracemization of axially chiral allenes as well as cyclopropylquinolones and cyclic ureas with central chirality either through energy transfer or through a sequence of electron, proton, and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

      <title>Polymer Networks: From Plastics and Gels to Porous Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Polymer networks are materials composed of linear strands connected by multifunctional junctions. These strands and junctions can be flexible or rigid (macro)molecules, and the connections between strands and junctions can be covalent or non&#8208;covalent. Thus, polymer networks comprise a vast array of useful materials ranging from elastomers and gels to porous crystalline frameworks.







Abstract
Polymer networks, which are materials composed of many smaller components&#8212;referred to as &#8220;junctions&#8221; and &#8220;strands&#8221;&#8212;connected together via covalent or non&#8208;covalent/supramolecular interactions, are arguably the most versatile, widely studied, broadly used, and important materials known. From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that must be addressed to enable a complete understanding of these materials and facilitate their development for emerging applications ranging from sustainability and energy harvesting/storage to tissue engineering and additive manufacturing. Here, we provide a unifying overview of the fundamentals of polymer network synthesis, structure, and properties, tying together recent trends in the field that are not always associated with classical polymer networks, such as the advent of crystalline &#8220;framework&#8221; materials. We also highlight recent advances in using molecular design and control of topology to showcase how a deep understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships can lead to advanced networks with exceptional properties.

      <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Chemical Approaches to Designer Structures and Built&#8208;In Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
Up to the imagination: This Review shows the fundamentals for transforming covalent organic frameworks into designer structures in terms of both the skeletons and pores. The focus lies on functions based on interplays between photons, excitons, electrons, holes, ions, spins, and molecules, with structure&#8211;function correlations and framework&#8208;specific properties described.







Abstract
A new approach has been developed to design organic polymers using topology diagrams. This strategy enables covalent integration of organic units into ordered topologies and creates a new polymer form, that is, covalent organic frameworks. This is a breakthrough in chemistry because it sets a molecular platform for synthesizing polymers with predesignable primary and high&#8208;order structures, which has been a central aim for over a century but unattainable with traditional design principles. This new field has its own features that are distinct from conventional polymers. This Review summarizes the fundamentals as well as major progress by focusing on the chemistry used to design structures, including the principles, synthetic strategies, and control methods. We scrutinize built&#8208;in functions that are specific to the structures by revealing various interplays and mechanisms involved in the expression of function. We propose major fundamental issues to be addressed in chemistry as well as future directions from physics, materials, and application perspectives.

      <title>Rational Design of an Iron&#8208;Based Catalyst for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Couplings Involving Heteroaromatic Boronic Esters and Tertiary Alkyl Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
Nacnac! Who's there? A mechanistically driven approach to Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with a nacnac iron&#8208;based catalyst enables the facile construction of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds with heteroaromatic boronic esters. Additional advancements allow for the construction of all carbon quaternary centers with no observable isomerization.







Abstract
Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions between a variety of alkyl halides and unactivated aryl boronic esters using a rationally designed iron&#8208;based catalyst supported by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands are described. High catalyst activity resulted in a broad substrate scope that included tertiary alkyl halides and heteroaromatic boronic esters. Mechanistic experiments revealed that the iron&#8208;based catalyst benefited from the propensity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands to support low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing iron amide intermediates, which are very efficient for effecting the transmetalation step required for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions between a variety of alkyl halides and unactivated aryl boronic esters using a rationally designed iron&#8208;based catalyst supported by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands are described. High catalyst activity resulted in a broad substrate scope that included tertiary alkyl halides and heteroaromatic boronic esters. Mechanistic experiments revealed that the iron&#8208;based catalyst benefited from the propensity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands to support low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing iron amide intermediates, which are very efficient for effecting the transmetalation step required for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Direct Aldol Addition of Aryl Ketones to &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated chiral tertiary alcohols from (hetero)aryl methyl ketones is described. A novel bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst facilitates direct aldol addition up to 1400 times faster than the previous state of the art.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated chiral tertiary alcohols from (hetero)aryl methyl ketones is described. The use of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase was found to facilitate direct aldol addition by providing the strong Br&#248;nsted basicity required for rapid aryl enolate formation. The new synthetic protocol is easy to perform and tolerates a broad range of functionalities and heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 e.r.). Multi&#8208;gram scalability has been demonstrated along with catalyst recovery and recycling. 1H&#8197;NMR studies identified a 1400&#8208;fold rate enhancement under BIMP catalysis, compared to the prior state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic system. The utility of the aldol products has been highlighted with the synthesis of various enantioenriched building blocks and heterocycles, including 1,3&#8208;aminoalcohol, 1,3&#8208;diol, oxetane, and isoxazoline derivatives.

      <title>Modulation of Prins Cyclization by Vibrational Strong Coupling
</title>
      <dc:description>
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) of a series of aldehyde and ketone reactants in the Prins cyclization is investigated. The second&#8208;order rate constant is decreased by VSC of the carbonyl stretching band. The extension of VSC chemistry to common cycloadditions further establishes a link between quantum electrodynamics and synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
Light&#8208;molecule strong coupling has emerged within the last decade as a new method to control chemical reactions. A few years ago it was discovered that chemical reactivity could be altered by vibrational strong coupling (VSC). Only a limited number of reactions have been investigated under VSC to date, including solvolysis and deprotection reactions. Here the effect of VSC on a series of aldehydes and ketones undergoing Prins cyclization, an important synthetic step in pharmaceutical chemistry, is investigated. A decrease of the second&#8208;order rate constant with VSC of the reactant carbonyl stretching groups is observed. We also observe an increased activation energy due to VSC, but proportional changes in activation enthalpy and entropy, suggesting no substantive change in reaction pathway. The addition of common cycloaddition reactions to the stable of VSC&#8208;modified chemical reactions is another step towards establishing VSC as a genuine tool for synthetic chemistry.

      <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;PF&#8208;1018</title>

The tetramic acid PF&#8208;1018 was synthetized through an 8&#960; electrocyclization, the product of which was immediately intercepted by a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition. The success of this pericyclic cascade critically depended on the substitution pattern of the starting polyene.







Abstract
The combination of electrocyclizations and cycloadditions accounts for the formation of a range of fascinating natural products. Cascades consisting of 8&#960; electrocyclizations followed by a 6&#960; electrocyclization and a cycloaddition are relatively common. We now report the synthesis of the tetramic acid PF&#8208;1018 through an 8&#960; electrocyclization, the product of which is immediately intercepted by a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition. The success of this pericyclic cascade was critically dependent on the substitution pattern of the starting polyene and could be rationalized through DFT calculations. The completion of the synthesis required the instalment of a trisubstituted double bond by radical deoxygenation. An unexpected side product formed through 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization could be recycled through an unprecedented triflation/fragmentation.

      <title>Specific Binding of a d&#8208;RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure with an l&#8208;RNA Aptamer</title>
      <dc:description>
Opposites attract: An l&#8208;RNA aptamer produced by in&#8197;vitro selection binds strongly and specifically to the TERRA d&#8208;RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4). Notably, it can distinguish TERRA rG4 from other rG4s and nucleic&#8208;acid structures, and is capable of inhibiting TERRA&#8208;rG4&#8211;peptide interactions.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures are of general importance in chemistry and biology, such as in biosensing, gene regulation, and cancers. Although a large repertoire of G4&#8208;binding tools has been developed, no aptamer has been developed to interact with G4. Moreover, the G4 selectivity of current toolkits is very limited. Herein, we report the first l&#8208;RNA aptamer that targets a d&#8208;RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4). Using TERRA rG4 as an example, our results reveal that this l&#8208;RNA aptamer, Ap3&#8208;7, folds into a unique secondary structure, exhibits high G4 selectivity and effectively interferes with TERRA&#8208;rG4&#8211;RHAU53 binding. Our approach and findings open a new door in further developing G4&#8208;specific tools for diverse applications.

      <title>Phosphonium Boranes for the Selective Transport of Fluoride Anions across Artificial Phospholipid Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Quick as a F&#8722;lash: The use of Lewis acidic, water&#8208;compatible phosphonium boranes is introduced for the quick and selective transport of F&#8722; across biological membrane mimics.







Abstract
With the view of developing selective transmembrane anion transporters, a series of phosphonium boranes of general formula [p&#8208;RPh2P(C6H4)BMes2]+ have been synthesized and evaluated. The results demonstrate that variation of the R group appended to the phosphorus atom informs the lipophilicity of these compounds, their Lewis acidity, as well as their transport activity. Anion transport experiments in POPC&#8208;based large unilamellar vesicles show that these main&#8208;group cations are highly selective for the fluoride anion, which is transported more than 20 times faster than the chloride anion. Finally, this work shows that the anion transport properties of these compounds are extremely sensitive to the steric crowding about the boron atom, pointing to the crucial involvement of the Group&#8197;13 element as the anion binding site.

      <title>Toughening a Self&#8208;Healable Supramolecular Polymer by Ionic Cluster&#8208;Enhanced Iron&#8208;Carboxylate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;density iron&#8208;carboxylate ionic clusters can remarkably toughen a dry supramolecular network by forming high&#8208;affinity secondary ionic clusters. The toughened network exhibits high mechanical strength, high stretchability, efficient self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers that can heal themselves automatically usually exhibit weakness in mechanical toughness and stretchability. Here we exploit a toughening strategy for a dynamic dry supramolecular network by introducing ionic cluster&#8208;enhanced iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes. The resulting dry supramolecular network simultaneous exhibits tough mechanical strength, high stretchability, self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature. The excellent performance of these distinct supramolecular polymers is attributed to the hierarchical existence of four types of dynamic combinations in the high&#8208;density dry network, including dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, noncovalent H&#8208;bonds, iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes and ionic clustering interactions. The extremely facile preparation method of this self&#8208;healing polymer offers prospects for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost material among others for coatings and wearable devices.

      <title>Probing Long&#8208;Range Anisotropic Interactions: a General and Sign&#8208;Sensitive Strategy to Measure 1H&#8211;1H Residual Dipolar Couplings as a Key Advance for Organic Structure Determination</title>
      <dc:description>
Access granted: NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) between nuclei are powerful reporters of the molecular structure, and RDCs between protons would be a key addition to many structure&#8208;elucidation problems. However, the overload of 1H&#8211;1H RDC interactions make both their magnitudes and signs unresolvable. Here, new experiments are introduced that make access to 1H&#8211;1H RDCs straightforward.







Abstract
Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are amongst the most powerful NMR parameters for organic structure elucidation. In order to maximize their effectiveness in increasingly complex cases such as flexible compounds, a maximum of RDCs between nuclei sampling a large distribution of orientations is needed, including sign information. For this, the easily accessible one&#8208;bond 1H&#8211;13C RDCs alone often fall short. Long&#8208;range 1H&#8211;1H RDCs are both abundant and typically sample highly complementary orientations, but accessing them in a sign&#8208;sensitive way has been severely obstructed due to the overflow of 1H&#8211;1H couplings. Here, we present a generally applicable strategy that allows the measurement of a large number of 1H&#8211;1H RDCs, including their signs, which is based on a combination of an improved PSYCHEDELIC method and a new selective constant&#8208;time &#946;&#8208;COSY experiment. The potential of 1H&#8211;1H RDCs to better determine molecular alignment and to discriminate between enantiomers and diastereomers is demonstrated.

      <title>NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Defluorinative Olefin Cross&#8208;Coupling: Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Alkenes as Acceptor Olefins to Form gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Walk the line: gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes are obtained through defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling between a donor olefin and trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted acceptor olefin. This migratory coupling is air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant, has a broad substrate scope, and proceeds with both site&#8208; and chemoselectivity under mild conditions. Chain&#8208;walking occurs only along the hydrocarbon chain of the donor olefin with no dissociation of NiH.







Abstract
We report a NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory defluorinative coupling between two electronically differentiated olefins. A broad range of unactivated donor olefins can be joined directly to acceptor olefins containing an electron&#8208;deficient trifluoromethyl substituent in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion to form gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This migratory coupling shows both site&#8208; and chemoselectivity under mild conditions, with the formation of a tertiary or quaternary carbon center.

      <title>Photoresponsive Propeller&#8208;like Chiral AIE Copper(I) Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
All in a spin: A pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear CuI clusters with typical aggregation induced emission (AIE) features were developed. They exhibit exceptional photoinduced fluorescence enhancement.







Abstract
A pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear CuI clusters (R/S&#8208;Cu3) with unique photoinduced fluorescence enhancement were prepared. R/S&#8208;Cu3 showed intense variable luminescence after UV light irradiation, which was attributed to the stepwise oxidation of ligand in the clusters. It exhibited typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) (&#945;AIE=17.3). Mechanism studies showed that metal cluster&#8208;centered (MCC) and triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) processes are the origin of the luminescence; the processes are regulated by a restriction of intramolecular motions mechanism in a different state. The chiral structure and AIE feature endow R/S&#8208;Cu3 with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence (glum=2&#215;10&#8722;2) in the aggregated state. It shows good capability for producing reactive oxygen species. This work enriches the kinds of atomically precise AIE clusters, gains insight into their luminescence mechanism, and offers the prospect of application in multifunctional materials.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for the Exploitation of Distance between Active Sites in Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
MOF Jenga: A series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) were used to overcome the limit of distance between active sites in bio&#8208;systems and to unveil the critical role of this distance for efficient catalysis. A linear correlation was established between photocatalytic activity and the reciprocal of inter active&#8208;site distance; a smaller distance led to higher activity.







Abstract
Discoveries of the accurate spatial arrangement of active sites in biological systems and cooperation between them for high catalytic efficiency are two major events in biology. However, precise tuning of these aspects is largely missing in the design of artificial catalysts. Here, a series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) were used, not only to overcome the limit of distance between active sites in bio&#8208;systems, but also to unveil the critical role of this distance for efficient catalysis. A linear correlation was established between photocatalytic activity and the reciprocal of inter active&#8208;site distance; a smaller distance led to higher activity. Vacancies created at selected crystallographic positions of MOFs promoted their photocatalytic efficiency. MOF&#8208;525&#8208;J33 with 15.6&#8197;&#197; inter active&#8208;site distance and 33&#8201;% vacancies exhibited unprecedented high turnover frequency of 29.5&#8197;h&#8722;1 in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acceptorless dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinoline at room temperature.

      <title>NHC/Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Unactivated Olefins and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;dimerization reactivity dominates over hydroalkenylation of methylenecyclopropanes (1) and alkenes (2) when using a new [NHC&#8208;NiII(allyl)]BArF catalyst under mild reaction conditions. Functionalized methylene cyclopentanes (3) were obtained as products in high yields and chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. The reaction scope and reactivity were complementary to the traditional Ni0/Pd0 systems. This discovery presents a new strategy for mild C&#8722;C activation of 1 and 1&#8242;. NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;dimerization of a methylenecyclopropane (1) and an unactivated alkene (2) with typical hydroalkenylation reactivity was observed for the first time by using a [NHC&#8208;Ni(allyl)]BArF catalyst (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Results show that the C&#8722;C cleavage of 1 did not involve a Ni0 oxidative addition, which was crucial in former systems. Thus the method reported here emerges as a complementary method for attaining highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of methylenecyclopentanes (3) with broad scope. An efficient NHC/NiII&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of 1 leads to the convergent synthesis of 3 in the presence of 2.

      <title>Highly Selective Separation of Minimum&#8208;Boiling Azeotrope Toluene/Pyridine by Nonporous Adaptive Crystals of Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep &#8217;em separated: A simple and energy&#8208;efficient separation method, using nonporous adaptive crystals of cucurbit[6]uril, for toluene/pyridine mixtures is reported. The method has a high selectivity for pyridine and can remove even a small quantity of pyridine in the crude toluene stream.







Abstract
The production of high purity toluene and pyridine is of significance in both industrial production and synthetic chemistry. The present protocols available to separate toluene/pyridine mixtures are several energy&#8208;intensive distillation methods, which are not environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective. Herein, we provide an energy&#8208;efficient and simple adsorptive separation protocol using nonporous adaptive crystals of cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6]). Q[6] crystals separate pyridine from toluene/pyridine mixtures with nearly 100&#8201;% purity. Furthermore, removal of the guest from guest&#8208;loaded Q[6] leads to the guest&#8208;free cucurbit[6]uril, which can be recycled without losing performance.

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis of Aromatic &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters for in Situ Production of Transient and Persistent Radicals for Organic Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;in&#8208;one: A photocatalyst mediates the generation of a transient &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical and a persistent ketyl radical from aromatic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters in&#8197;situ, which enables straightforward synthesis of pinacols and highly substituted 1&#8208;naphthols in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner under mild conditions.







Abstract
Radical formation is the initial step for conventional radical chemistry. Reported herein is a unified strategy to generate radicals in situ from aromatic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters by using a photocatalyst. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, a small amount of photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 generates a transient &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical and persistent ketyl radical in situ. In contrast to the well&#8208;established approaches, neither stoichiometric external oxidant nor reductant is required for this reaction. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by pinacol coupling of ketyl radicals and benzannulation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals with alkynes to give a series of highly substituted 1&#8208;naphthols in good to excellent yields. The readily available photocatalyst, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and high functional&#8208;group tolerance make this reaction a useful synthetic tool.

      <title>Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Heck Arylation/Amination of Nonconjugated Cyclodienes</title>
      <dc:description>
Deep pockets: Heck arylation of nonconjugated dienes under palladium catalysis produces &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes, which can be trapped by various amines to give substituted cyclohexenylamines with good enantioselectivity and exclusively trans configuration. The weakly donating diphosphate ligand Kelliphite forms a deep unsymmetrical pocket, which is essential for stereoselective anti attack of amines.







Abstract
Substituted cyclohexylamines are becoming increasingly important in drug discovery. Asymmetric Heck insertion/amination of nonconjugated cyclodienes proceeds to give 5&#8208;aryl cyclohexenylamines with good enantioselectivity and exclusive trans configurations. Primary and secondary anilines, indoline, and benzylamines are suitable amines. The weakly donating diphosphite Kelliphite forms a deep unsymmetrical pocket, which is essential for stereoselective anti attack of amines.

Abstract
We report on a stabilizer of the interaction between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; and the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;). ER&#945; is a driver in the majority of breast cancers and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins are negative regulators of this nuclear receptor, making the stabilization of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) an interesting strategy. The stabilizer (1) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms containing an arginine mimetic, previously described as the GCP motif. 1 stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A and was thus hypothesized to bind to a different site. This is supported by computational analysis of 1 binding to the binary complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived phosphopeptide. Furthermore, 1 shows selectivity towards 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction over other 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client&#8208;derived phosphomotifs. These data provide a solid support of a new binding mode for a supramolecular 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; PPI stabilizer.

      <title>Anchored Mediator Enabling Shuttle&#8208;Free Redox Mediation in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The shuttling phenomenon is the most severe drawback of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries, caused by the freely mobile nature of RMs. The shuttle effect was eliminated by anchoring RMs on the air electrode in form of a polymer. Successful prevention of the shuttle effect results in a remarkable improvement of the lithium&#8208;oxygen cell&#8208;performance.







Abstract
Redox mediators (RMs) are considered an effective countermeasure to reduce the large polarization in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient enhancement of the cyclability is limited by the trade&#8208;offs of freely mobile RMs, which are beneficial for charge transport but also trigger the shuttling phenomenon. Here, we successfully decoupled the charge&#8208;carrying redox property of RMs and shuttling phenomenon by anchoring the RMs in polymer form, where physical RM migration was replaced by charge transfer along polymer chains. Using PTMA (poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;yl methacrylate)) as a polymer model system based on the well&#8208;known RM tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), it is demonstrated that PTMA can function as stationary RM, preserving the redox activity of TEMPO. The efficiency of RM&#8208;mediated Li2O2 decomposition remains remarkably stable without the consumption of oxidized RMs or degradation of the lithium anode, resulting in an improved performance of the lithium&#8208;oxygen cell.

      <title>Minimization of Carrier Losses for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells through Structural Modification of Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>

Although all these HTMs show very similar chemical and physical properties, they provide different carrier recombination kinetics.







Abstract
Three hole transport materials (HTMs) based on a substituted triphenylamine moiety have been synthesized and successfully employed in triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide PSCs, reaching efficiencies of 19.4&#8201;%. The efficiencies, comparable to those obtained using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, point them out as promising candidates for easily attainable and cost&#8208;effective alternatives for PSCs, given their facile synthesis from commercially available materials. Interestingly, although all these HTMs show similar chemical and physical properties, they provide different carrier recombination kinetics. Our results demonstrate that is feasible through the molecular design of the HTM to minimize carrier losses and, thus, increase the solar cell efficiencies.

      <title>Li/Garnet Interface Stabilization by Thermal&#8208;Decomposition Vapor Deposition of an Amorphous Carbon Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermal decomposition vapor deposition of a graphitized carbon modification layer provides air stability and a contaminant&#8208;free surface of a garnet electrolyte. It also leads to an improved Li/garnet interface with high current density endurance and polarization voltage stability.







Abstract
Applying interlayers is the main strategy to address the large area specific resistance (ASR) of Li/garnet interface. However, studies on eliminating the Li2CO3 and LiOH interfacial lithiophobic contaminants are still insufficient. Here, thermal&#8208;decomposition vapor deposition (TVD) of a carbon modification layer on Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) provides a contaminant&#8208;free surface. Owing to the protection of the carbon layer, the air stability of LLZTO is also improved. Moreover, owing to the amorphous structure of the low graphitized carbon (LGC), instant lithiation is achieved, and the ASR of the Li/LLZTO interface is reduced to 9&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2. Lithium volatilization and Zr4+ reduction are also controllable during TVD. Compared with its high graphitized carbon counterpart (HGC), the LGC&#8208;modified Li/LLZTO interface displays a higher critical current density of 1.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as moderate Li plating and stripping, which provides enhanced polarization voltage stability.

Abstract
The first alkali&#8208;metal vanadium iodate fluoride, CsVO2F(IO3), with a novel 3D anionic framework, has been rationally designed and hydrothermally synthesized. The 3D [VO2F(IO3)]&#8722; framework in CsVO2F(IO3) is built from 0D &#923;&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;[VO3F(IO3)2]4&#8722; polyanions via corner&#8208;sharing of oxo anions and bridging of the iodate groups. CsVO2F(IO3) displays both a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) 1.1 times as strong as KTiOPO4 (KTP) under 2.05&#8197;&#956;m laser radiation and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT) of 107.9&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new route to design SHG crystals with stable 3D anionic structures from low&#8208;dimensional structural building units.

      <title>A Redox&#8208;Active 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Lithium Storage with Extraordinary High Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance MOF: A conductive and redox&#8208;active copper&#8211;benzoquinoid 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with high capacity was designed for Li&#8208;ion batterie. A new Li&#8208;ion storage mechanism was unveiled by comprehensive spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework cathodes usually exhibit low capacity and poor electrochemical performance for Li&#8208;ion storage owing to intrinsic low conductivity and inferior redox activity. Now a redox&#8208;active 2D copper&#8211;benzoquinoid (Cu&#8208;THQ) MOF has been synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. The abundant porosity and intrinsic redox character endow the 2D Cu&#8208;THQ MOF with promising electrochemical activity. Superior performance is achieved as a Li&#8208;ion battery cathode with a high reversible capacity (387&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), large specific energy density (775&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1), and good cycling stability. The reaction mechanism is unveiled by comprehensive spectroscopic techniques: a three&#8208;electron redox reaction per coordination unit and one&#8208;electron redox reaction per copper ion mechanism is demonstrated. This elucidatory understanding sheds new light on future rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based cathode materials for efficient energy storage and conversion.

      <title>Conformational Dynamics of Monomer&#8208; versus Dimer&#8208;like Features in a Naphthalenediimide&#8208;Based Conjugated Cyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
A shining duo: A pair of conjugated cyclophane enantiomers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Cyclo&#8208;NDIs, is reported. The spatial electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI is modulated by external stimuli such as the temperature and solvent polarity, resulting in large optical changes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based cyclophanes (Cyclo&#8208;NDIs) are reported. Each enantiomer of Cyclo&#8208;NDI exhibits a circularly polarized luminescence signal with a relatively large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3). We have further investigated the modulation of through&#8208;space electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented NDIs in a discrete Cyclo&#8208;NDI with changes in the temperature. Tuning of the electronic communication results from the conformational transformation of monomer&#8208; versus dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI, as confirmed by UV/Vis, fluorescence, circular dichroic, and NMR spectroscopic analysis. The temperature&#8208;dependent optical response in the Cyclo&#8208;NDI through the conformational transformation could be utilized as a highly sensitive and reversible optical thermometer in a wide temperature range (100 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C).

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 2&#8208;Amidoacrylates</title>
      <dc:description>
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;amidoacrylates using a catalyst based on earth&#8208;abundant nickel has been developed. The hydrogenated products are obtained with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee) and high catalytic efficiency (S/C up to 2000) and can be simply converted into chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant nickel, coordinated with a suitable chiral bisphosphine ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;amidoacrylates, affording the chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). The active catalyst component was studied by NMR and HRMS, which helped us to realize high catalytic efficiency on a gram scale with a low catalyst loading (S/C=2000). The hydrogenated products could be simply converted into chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, and their bioactive derivatives. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was investigated using deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and computational calculations.

      <title>(NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5: An Unusual Ammonium&#8208;Containing Metal Iodate Fluoride Showing Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Thermochromic Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>

Abstract
An ammonium&#8208;containing metal iodate fluoride compound, (NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5, featuring a two&#8208;dimensional double&#8208;layered framework constructed by [BiO2F5]6&#8722; and [BiO4F4]9&#8722; polyhedra, as well as [IO3]&#8722; groups, was successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;ordered alignment of these SHG&#8208;active units leads to an extraordinary strong SHG response of 9.2 times that of KDP. Moreover, this compound possesses a large birefringence (&#916;n=0.0690 at 589.3&#8197;nm), a wide energy band gap (Eg=3.88&#8197;eV), and a high laser damage threshold (LDT; 40.2&#215;AgGaS2). In particular, thermochromic behavior was observed for the first time in this type of compound. Such multifunctional crystals will expand the application of nonlinear optical materials.

      <title>Synthesis of Anisotropic ZnSe Nanorods with Zinc Blende Crystal Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
ZnSe nanorods with the cubic zinc blende crystal structure are synthesized from anisotropic nuclei by an anisotropic growth mechanism.







Abstract
Compared with the well&#8208;explored cadmium&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional nanorods (NRs), it is still a challenge to produce heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free II&#8211;VI semiconductor analogues with a controlled size, shape, and crystal structure. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards ZnSe NRs with a zinc blende crystal structure is presented, where use of the anisotropic nuclei produced via a high&#8208;temperature selenium injection favors anisotropic growth. Elongated ZnSe NRs were produced from anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, while spherical ZnSe nanocrystals were obtained starting from isotropic nuclei. The different free energy at (111) and (220) planes in anisotropic ZnSe nuclei induces the anisotropic growth of (111) plane for ZnSe NRs. Proper choice of the capping ligand (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) has an important implication for the formation of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei and also allows the control of the diameter of the final ZnSe NRs by limiting the growth of the (220) crystal plane of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei.

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the well&#8208;explored cadmium&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional nanorods (NRs), it is still a challenge to produce heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free II&#8211;VI semiconductor analogues with a controlled size, shape, and crystal structure. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards ZnSe NRs with a zinc blende crystal structure is presented, where use of the anisotropic nuclei produced via a high&#8208;temperature selenium injection favors anisotropic growth. Elongated ZnSe NRs were produced from anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, while spherical ZnSe nanocrystals were obtained starting from isotropic nuclei. The different free energy at (111) and (220) planes in anisotropic ZnSe nuclei induces the anisotropic growth of (111) plane for ZnSe NRs. Proper choice of the capping ligand (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) has an important implication for the formation of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei and also allows the control of the diameter of the final ZnSe NRs by limiting the growth of the (220) crystal plane of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preferential Formation of Mono&#8208;Metallofullerenes Governed by the Encapsulation Energy of the Metal Elements: A Case Study on Eu@C2n (2n=74&#8211;84) Revealing a General Rule</title>
      <dc:description>
Energy trumps size: The encapsulation energy of endohedral metal elements is shown to be a key factor which governs the preferential formation of mono&#8208;metallofullerenes during the arc&#8208;discharge when europium is used. This concept also rationalizes similar observations for metallofullerenes containing other metals for example, Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb.







Abstract
Encapsulating one to three metal atoms or a metallic cluster inside fullerene cages affords endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) classified as mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and cluster&#8208;EMFs, respectively. Although the coexistence of various EMF species in soot is common for rare&#8208;earth metals, we herein report that europium tends to prefer the formation of mono&#8208;EMFs. Mass spectroscopy reveals that mono&#8208;EMFs (Eu@C2n) prevail in the Eu&#8208;containing soot. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the encapsulation energy of the endohedral metal accounts for the selective formation of mono&#8208;EMFs and rationalize similar observations for EMFs containing other metals like Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb. Consistently, all isolated Eu&#8208;EMFs are mono&#8208;EMFs, including Eu@D3h(1)&#8208;C74, Eu@C2v(19138)&#8208;C76, Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C78, Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C80, and Eu@D3d(19)&#8208;C84, which are identified by crystallography. Remarkably, Eu@C2v(19138)&#8208;C76 represents the first Eu&#8208;containing EMF with a cage that violates the isolated&#8208;pentagon&#8208;rule, and Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C78 is the first C78&#8208;based EMF stabilized by merely one metal atom.

      <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Round round get around: An FeII&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic aerobic oxidation of alcohols was developed based on the biological oxidation of alcohols in the respiratory chain. Electron transfer from the alcohol to molecular oxygen occurs via three coupled catalytic redox cycles, leading to a low&#8208;energy pathway. An Fe complex was utilized as a substrate&#8208;selective catalyst, along with a quinone and an oxygen&#8208;activating Co complex as electron&#8208;transfer mediators.







Abstract
We report the first FeII&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The principle of this oxidation, which involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is reminiscent of biological oxidation in the respiratory chain. The electron transfer from the alcohol to molecular oxygen occurs with the aid of three coupled catalytic redox systems, leading to a low&#8208;energy pathway. An iron transfer&#8208;hydrogenation complex was utilized as a substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation catalyst, along with an electron&#8208;rich quinone and an oxygen&#8208;activating Co(salen)&#8208;type complex as electron&#8208;transfer mediators. Various primary and secondary alcohols were oxidized in air to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones with this method in good to excellent yields.

      <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of a Copper&#8208;based Electrocatalyst for Selective Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>
Ammonia boost: CuO NWAs are efficient nitrate electroreduction catalysts for the selective synthesis of ammonia. In&#8197;situ experiments revealed that CuO was electrochemically converted into Cu/Cu2O, which serves as an active phase. The electron transfer at the interface of Cu/Cu2O could facilitate the formation of *NOH intermediate and suppress the competitive H2 production.







Abstract
Unveiling the active phase of catalytic materials under reaction conditions is important for the construction of efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction to ammonia. The origin of the prominent activity enhancement for CuO (Faradaic efficiency: 95.8&#8201;%, Selectivity: 81.2&#8201;%) toward selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia was probed. 15N isotope labeling experiments showed that ammonia originated from nitrate reduction. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and colorimetric methods were performed to quantify ammonia. In&#8197;situ Raman and ex&#8197;situ experiments revealed that CuO was electrochemically converted into Cu/Cu2O, which serves as an active phase. The combined results of online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and DFT calculations demonstrated that the electron transfer from Cu2O to Cu at the interface could facilitate the formation of *NOH intermediate and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency.

      <title>Formation of an Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Ag112 Silver Nanocluster as Promoted by Chloride Released In Situ from CH2Cl2</title>
      <dc:description>
Clever Cl: A large silver nanocluster, [Ag112Cl6(C&#8801;CAr)51]3&#8722;, composed of four concentric core&#8211;shell structures (Ag13@Ag42@Ag48@Ag9) was obtained by reducing alkynyl&#8211;silver precursors with the weak reducing agent diphenylsilane. The in situ release of chloride ions from the CH2Cl2 solvent was critical for formation of the nanocluster, in which four different alkynyl&#8211;silver binding modes are observed (see picture).







Abstract
By directly reducing alkynyl&#8211;silver precursors, we successfully obtained a large alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanocluster, (C7H17ClN)3[Ag112Cl6(C&#8801;CAr)51], which is hitherto the largest structurally characterized silver nanocluster in the alkynyl family. The cluster exhibits four concentric core&#8211;shell structures (Ag13@Ag42@Ag48@Ag9), and four types of alkynyl&#8211;silver binding modes are observed. Chloride was found to be critical for the stabilization and formation of the silver nanocluster. The release of chloride ions in situ from CH2Cl2 solvent has been confirmed by mass spectrometry. This study suggests that the combination of alkynyl and halide ligands will pave a new way for the synthesis of large silver nanoclusters.

      <title>Stereospecific Asymmetric Synthesis of Tertiary Allylic Alcohol Derivatives by Catalytic [2,3]&#8208;Meisenheimer Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral acyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are very important synthetic building blocks, but their enantioselective synthesis is often challenging. A major limitation in catalytic asymmetric 1,2&#8208;addition approaches to ketones is the enantioface differentiation by steric distinction of both ketone residues. In this communication we report the development of a catalytic asymmetric Meisenheimer rearrangement to overcome this problem, as it proceeds in a stereospecific manner. This allows for high enantioselectivity also for the formation of products in which the residues at the generated tetrasubstituted stereocenter display a similar steric demand. Low catalyst loadings were found to be sufficient and the reaction conditions were mild enough to tolerate even highly reactive functional groups such as an enolizable aldehyde, a primary tosylate or an epoxide. Our investigations suggest an intramolecular rearrangement pathway.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The controlled synthesis of multicomponent MOFs allows for the precise placement of multiple corporative functional groups within a framework, leading to emergent synergistic effects. Herein, we demonstrate that &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent sensors can be assembled by combining a fluorophore and a recognition moiety within a complex cavity of a multicomponent MOF.

The selective binding of CN&#8208; to hemicyanine inhibited the energy transfer between the two moieties, resulting in a fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; effect. Taking advantage of the high tunability of the MOF platform, the ratio between anthracene and the hemicyanine moiety could be fine&#8208;tuned in order to maximize the sensitivity of the overall framework. The optimized MOF&#8208;sensor had a CN&#8208; detection limit of 0.05 &#956;M, which is much lower than traditional CN&#8208; molecular fluorescent sensors (~0.2 &#956;M).</dc:description>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Self&#8208;Assembly for Scalable Preparation of Highly Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>Mesoporous metal oxides (MMOs) have been demonstrated great potential in various applications. Up to now, the direct synthesis of MMOs is still limited to the solvent induced inorganic&#8208;organic self&#8208;assembly process. Here, we develop a facile, general, and high throughput solvent&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a series of MMOs including single&#8208;component MMOs and multi&#8208;component MMOs (e.g., doped MMOs, composite MMOs, and polymetallic oxide) with high crystallinity and remarkable porous properties by grinding and heating raw materials. Compared with the traditional solution self&#8208;assembly process, the avoidance of solvents in this method not only greatly increases the yield of target products and synthesis efficiency, but also reduces the environmental pollution and the consumption of cost and energy. We believe the presented approach will pave a new avenue for scalable production of advanced mesoporous materials for various applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous metal oxides (MMOs) have been demonstrated great potential in various applications. Up to now, the direct synthesis of MMOs is still limited to the solvent induced inorganic&#8208;organic self&#8208;assembly process. Here, we develop a facile, general, and high throughput solvent&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a series of MMOs including single&#8208;component MMOs and multi&#8208;component MMOs (e.g., doped MMOs, composite MMOs, and polymetallic oxide) with high crystallinity and remarkable porous properties by grinding and heating raw materials. Compared with the traditional solution self&#8208;assembly process, the avoidance of solvents in this method not only greatly increases the yield of target products and synthesis efficiency, but also reduces the environmental pollution and the consumption of cost and energy. We believe the presented approach will pave a new avenue for scalable production of advanced mesoporous materials for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Content Detection of G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA in Live Cells Based on Photon Counts and Complex Structures</title>
      <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplex DNA undergoes structural polymorphism, leading challenging around using selectively recognizing probe to accurately detect G&#8208;quadruplexes  in vivo  . Herein, we developed a selectively responsive probe, a tripodal cationic fluorescent probe,  NBTE  , which showed distinguishable fluorescence lifetime response between all kinds of G&#8208;quadruplexes and other DNA topologies, and fluorescence quantum yield enhancing upon G&#8208;quadruplexes binding. We determined two  NBTE&#8211;  G&#8208;quadruplex complex structures with high fluorescence quantum yield by NMR method. The structures indicated  NBTE  interacted with G&#8208;quadruplexes using three arms through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, differing from that with duplex DNA using two arms, which rationalized higher fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime response of  NBTE  upon G&#8208;quadruplexes binding. Based on photon counts of FLIM, we detected the percentage of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA in live cells with  NBTE  , and found G&#8208;quadruplex DNA content in cancer cells is ~4 times that in normal cells, suggesting the potential applications of this probe in cancer cells detection.</dc:description>

These nanocomposites undergo a variety of charge and energy transfer processes, enabling optoelectronic applications in devices which exploit singlet fission, triplet energy harvesting, photon upconversion or hot charge carrier transfer. We discuss the physical chemistry of the most common organic and inorganic components.

      <title>Silica bilayer supported on Ru(0001): Following the crystalline to vitreous transformation in real time with spectro&#8208;microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The crystalline to vitreous phase transformation of a SiO  2  bilayer supported on Ru(0001) was studied by means of time&#8208;dependent LEED, local XPS and DFT calculations. The silica bilayer system constitutes a model system that has interesting parallels to 3D silica glass and can be used to understand the mechanism of the disorder transition. An Arrhenius analysis of the time constant for the phase transformation in the 2D hexagonal network of crystalline silica at variable temperature gives apparent activation energy values ( Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText ) of (4.2 &#177; 0.6) and (4.1 &#177; 0.2) eV for the transformation in UHV and O  2  atmosphere, respectively. The differences observed in the Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText values lie within the experimental accuracy of the determination. DFT simulations show that the formation of a Stone&#8208;Wales type of defect follows a complex mechanism, where the two layers show decoupled behavior in terms of chemical bond rearrangements. The calculated activation energy of the rate determining step for the formation of a Stone&#8208;Wales type of defect of 4.3 eV is in a very good agreement with the experimental value. Charge transfer between SiO  2  bilayer and Ru(0001) support is shown to lower the activation energy for breaking the Si&#8208;O bond compared to the unsupported film. The pre&#8208;exponential factors obtained under both atmospheres differ significantly, thus suggesting that the interfacial O  Ru  underneath the SiO  2  bilayer plays a role on how the disordering propagates within the film.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of d3 Molybdenum&#8208;Oxo Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Reduction of d  2  metal&#8211;oxo ions of the form [MO(PP)  2  Cl]  +  (M = Mo, W; PP = chelating diphosphine) produces d  3  MO(PP)  2  Cl complexes, which include the first isolated examples in group 6. The stability and reactivity of the MO(PP)  2  Cl compounds are found to depend upon the steric bulk of the phosphine ligands: derivatives with bulky phosphines that shield the oxo ligand are stable enough to be isolated, whereas those with phosphines that leave the oxo ligand exposed are more reactive and observed transiently. Magnetic measurements and DFT calculations on MoO(dppe)  2  Cl indicate the d  3  compounds are low spin with a  2  [(d  xy  )  2  (&#960;*(MoO)  1  ] configuration. X&#8208;ray crystallographic and vibrational&#8208;spectroscopic studies on d  2  and d  3  [MoO(dppe)  2  Cl]  0/+  establish that the d  3  compound possesses a reduced M&#8211;O bond order and significantly longer Mo&#8211;O bond, accounting for its greater reactivity.

      <dc:description>The necessity for precision labeling of proteins emerged during the efforts to understand and regulate their structure and function. It demands selective attachment of tags such as affinity probes, fluorophores, and potent cytotoxins. Here, we report a method that enables single&#8208;site labeling of a high&#8208;frequency Lys residue in the native proteins. At first, the enabling reagent forms stabilized imines chemoselectively with multiple solvent&#8208;accessible Lys residues. These linchpins create the opportunity to regulate the position of second Lys&#8208;selective electrophile connected by a spacer. Consequently, it enables the irreversible single&#8208;site labeling of a Lys residue independent of its place in the reactivity order. The user&#8208;friendly protocol involves a series of steps to deconvolute and address chemoselectivity, site&#8208;selectivity, and modularity. Also, it delivers ordered immobilization and analytically pure probe&#8208;tagged proteins. Besides, the methodology provides access to antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC), which exhibits highly selective anti&#8208;proliferative activity towards HER&#8208;2 expressing SKBR&#8208;3 breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Nickel(II) Mediated Reversible Thiolate/Disulfide Conversion as a Mimic for a Key Step of The Catalytic Cycle of Methyl Coenzyme M Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>According to the well&#8208;accepted mechanism, methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase (MCR) involves Ni mediated thiolate to disulfide conversion that sustains its catalytic cycle of methane formation in the energy saving pathways of methanotrophic microbes. Model complexes that illustrate Ni ion mediated reversible thiolate/disulfide transformation are unknown. In this paper we report the synthesis, crystal structure, spectroscopic properties and redox interconversions of a set of NiII complexes comprising a tridentate N2S donor thiol and its analogous N4S2 donor disulfide ligands. These complexes demonstrate reversible NiII&#8208;thiolate/NiII&#8208;disulfide (both bound and unbound disulfide&#8208;S to NiII) transformations via thiyl and disulfide mono radical anions that resemble a primary step of MCR&#8217;s catalytic cycle.</dc:description>
