      <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of d3 Molybdenum&#8208;Oxo Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Reduction of d  2  metal&#8211;oxo ions of the form [MO(PP)  2  Cl]  +  (M = Mo, W; PP = chelating diphosphine) produces d  3  MO(PP)  2  Cl complexes, which include the first isolated examples in group 6. The stability and reactivity of the MO(PP)  2  Cl compounds are found to depend upon the steric bulk of the phosphine ligands: derivatives with bulky phosphines that shield the oxo ligand are stable enough to be isolated, whereas those with phosphines that leave the oxo ligand exposed are more reactive and observed transiently. Magnetic measurements and DFT calculations on MoO(dppe)  2  Cl indicate the d  3  compounds are low spin with a  2  [(d  xy  )  2  (&#960;*(MoO)  1  ] configuration. X&#8208;ray crystallographic and vibrational&#8208;spectroscopic studies on d  2  and d  3  [MoO(dppe)  2  Cl]  0/+  establish that the d  3  compound possesses a reduced M&#8211;O bond order and significantly longer Mo&#8211;O bond, accounting for its greater reactivity. These results indicate that the oxo&#8208;centered reactivity of d  3  complexes may be controlled through ligand variation.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemoselective and Site&#8208;Selective Lysine&#8208;Directed Lysine Modification Enables Single&#8208;Site Labeling of Native Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>The necessity for precision labeling of proteins emerged during the efforts to understand and regulate their structure and function. It demands selective attachment of tags such as affinity probes, fluorophores, and potent cytotoxins. Here, we report a method that enables single&#8208;site labeling of a high&#8208;frequency Lys residue in the native proteins. At first, the enabling reagent forms stabilized imines chemoselectively with multiple solvent&#8208;accessible Lys residues. These linchpins create the opportunity to regulate the position of second Lys&#8208;selective electrophile connected by a spacer. Consequently, it enables the irreversible single&#8208;site labeling of a Lys residue independent of its place in the reactivity order. The user&#8208;friendly protocol involves a series of steps to deconvolute and address chemoselectivity, site&#8208;selectivity, and modularity. Also, it delivers ordered immobilization and analytically pure probe&#8208;tagged proteins. Besides, the methodology provides access to antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC), which exhibits highly selective anti&#8208;proliferative activity towards HER&#8208;2 expressing SKBR&#8208;3 breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

      <title>21st Century, More Twins in Scientific Literature: Intentional or Accidental?</title>
      <dc:description>This essay highlights the complex issue of twinning in science publications. Historical accounts present cases where two scientists focused on the same problem and came up with the same solution following different paths. This has changed in the present situation. Birth of twins in research literature has increased post 2010. In early 1900s to 2000s, twinning in research publication was serendipitous, and there was a healthy competition among teams working on similar products. At present, twinning has become a norm rather than serendipity. This can be attributed to the urge to have publications in popular themes, dependence on building research on popular key words, superficial glancing at literature and funding agencies backing thematic areas. As we inch away from human ingenuity towards Artificial Intelligence, twinning may become a norm of the day and this may result in not just twins but multiple clones appearing in scientific literature.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Incorporation of non&#8208;equilibrium actions in the sequence of self&#8208;assembly processes would be an effective means to establish bio&#8208;like high functionality hierarchic assemblies. As a novel methodology beyond self&#8208;assembly, nanoarchitectonics, which has as its aim the fabrication of functional materials systems from nanoscopic units through the methodological fusion of nanotechnology with other scientific disciplines including organic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, microfabrication, and bio&#8208;process, has been applied to this strategy. The application of non&#8208;equilibrium factors to conventional self&#8208;assembly processes is discussed on the basis of examples of directed assembly, Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett assembly, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly. In particular, examples of the fabrication of hierarchic functional structures using bio&#8208;active components such as proteins or by the combination of bio&#8208;components and two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, are described.

      <title>Nickel(II) Mediated Reversible Thiolate/Disulfide Conversion as a Mimic for a Key Step of The Catalytic Cycle of Methyl Coenzyme M Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>According to the well&#8208;accepted mechanism, methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase (MCR) involves Ni mediated thiolate to disulfide conversion that sustains its catalytic cycle of methane formation in the energy saving pathways of methanotrophic microbes. Model complexes that illustrate Ni ion mediated reversible thiolate/disulfide transformation are unknown. In this paper we report the synthesis, crystal structure, spectroscopic properties and redox interconversions of a set of NiII complexes comprising a tridentate N2S donor thiol and its analogous N4S2 donor disulfide ligands. These complexes demonstrate reversible NiII&#8208;thiolate/NiII&#8208;disulfide (both bound and unbound disulfide&#8208;S to NiII) transformations via thiyl and disulfide mono radical anions that resemble a primary step of MCR&#8217;s catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable meso&#8208;meso Linked 2NH&#8208;Corrole Radical Dimers as a Key Intermediate to Corrole Tape</title>

The stability of this peculiar product has been ascribed largely to strong antiferromagnetic interaction of the two spins. Further oxidation of this diradical produced the corrole tape, suggesting its involvement as a reaction intermediate to the corrole tape. As another example, oxidation of 10&#8208;10&#8217;&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridine&#8208;coordinated CoIII corrole dimer with DDQ produced a cobalt corrole radical dimer and a doubly&#8208;linked corrole dimer both as stable compounds bearing pyridine and cyanide axial ligands. Bis&#8208;pyridine&#8208;coordinated CoIII corrole monomer was also converted to the corresponding corrole radical upon treatment with cyanide anion. Further oxidation of the cobalt corrole radical dimer with p&#8208;chloranil gave the doubly&#8208;linked cobalt corrole dimer exclusively. This type of oxidative transformation involving neutral diradical intermediates is a unique reaction mechanism specific for corrole dimers.</dc:description>

      <title>Extending the Sensitivity of CEST to Micro&#8208;to&#8208;Millisecond Dynamics in Nucleic Acids Using High Power Radio&#8208;Frequency Fields</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Biomolecules undergo motions on the micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale to adopt low&#8208;populated transient states that play important roles in folding, recognition, and catalysis. NMR techniques such as CPMG, CEST and&#160;  R  1&#961;  are the most commonly used methods for characterizing such transitions at atomic resolution under solution conditions. CPMG and CEST are most effective at characterizing motions on the millisecond timescale. While some implementations of the&#160;  R  1&#961;  experiment are more broadly sensitive to motions on the micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale, they entail the use of selective irradiation schemes and inefficient 1D data acquisition methods. Here, we show that high power radio&#8208;frequency fields can be used in&#160; CEST experiments to extend sensitivity to faster motions on the micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale.&#160; Given the ease of implementing high power fields in CEST, the work described here should make it easier to characterize micro&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond dynamics in biomolecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Bi3+&#8208;Ln3+ (Ln = Er and Yb) codoped Cs2AgInCl6 Double Perovskite Near Infrared Emitter</title>
      <dc:description>Bi  3+  and lanthanide ions were previously codoped in metal oxides as optical sensitizers and emitters. But such codoping is not known in typical semiconductors like Si, GaAs, CdSe, since the coordination number (CN) for metal ions is 4, which is insufficient to accommodate large sized Bi  3+  and lanthanide ions. Metal halide perovskite with coordination number 6 provides an opportunity to codope Bi  3+  and lanthanide ions. Here we report codoping of Bi  3+  and Ln  3+  (Ln = Er and Yb) in Cs  2  AgInCl  6  double perovskite. Bi  3+  &#8208;Er  3+  codoped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  shows Er  3+  f  &#8208;electron emission at 1540 nm (suitable for low&#8208;loss optical communication). Bi  3+  codoping decreases the excitation (absorption) energy, such that the samples can be excited with ~370 nm light using a commercial UV light emitting diodes. At that excitation, Bi  3+  &#8208;Er  3+  codoped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  shows ~45 times higher emission intensity compared to the Er  3+  doped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  . Similar results are also observed in Bi  3+  &#8208;Yb  3+  codoped sample emitting at 994 nm. A combination of temperature dependent (5.7 K to 423 K) photoluminescence and first&#8208;principles calculation study is used to understand the optical sensitization and emission processes in Bi  3+  &#8208;Ln  3+  codoped Cs  2  AgInCl  6  .</dc:description>

      <title>Engraving the Surface of Electrospun Microfibers with Nanoscale Grooves Promotes the Outgrowth of Neurites and the Migration of Schwann Cells</title>
      <dc:description>We report a simple method based upon coaxial electrospinning for the fabrication of aligned microfibers engraved with nanoscale grooves to promote neurite outgrowth and cell migration. The success of this method relies on the immiscibility between poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) in 2, 2, 2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) for the generation of PVP/TFE pockets on the surface of a PCL jet. The pockets are stretched and elongated along with the jet, eventually resulting in the formation of nanoscale grooves upon the removal of PVP. The presence of nanoscale grooves greatly enhances&#160;the outgrowth of neurites from both PC12 cells and chick embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) bodies, as well as the migration of Schwann cells. The enhancements can be maximized by optimizing the dimensions of the grooves for potential use in applications involving neurite extension and wound closure.</dc:description>

      <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxides for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;sequins: A facile and spontaneous strategy for synthesizing silver&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated transition&#8208;metal hydroxide nanohybrids on carbon cloth is presented. The nanohybrids exhibit substantially enhanced OER activity and durability owing to the strong metal&#8211;support interaction and decreased reaction energetic barrier on the heterostructure nanocatalysts.







Abstract
The fabrication of metal&#8208;supported hybrid structures with enhanced properties typically requires external energy input, such as pyrolysis, photolysis, and electrodeposition. In this study, silver&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated transition&#8208;metal hydroxide (TMH) composites were synthesized by an approach based on a spontaneous redox reaction (SRR) at room temperature. The SRR between silver ions and TMH provides a simple and facile route to establish effective and stable heterostructures that can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Ag@Co(OH)x grown on carbon cloth exhibits outstanding OER activity and durability, even superior to IrO2 and many previously reported OER electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrates that the strong electronic interaction between Ag and Co(OH)2 activates the silver clusters as catalytically OER active sites, effectively optimizing the binding energies with reacted intermediates and facilitating the OER kinetics.

      <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Allenes by Direct Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Organolithium Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective formation of allenic product is achieved in the direct cross&#8208;coupling of allenyl&#8208; and propargyllithium species with aryl bromides. The synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenes is achieved in good to excellent yields without any previous formation of transition metal species. The fundamental role of ligand in the selectivity of the transformation is described and studied by experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between in&#8197;situ generated allenyl/propargyl&#8208;lithium species and aryl bromides to yield highly functionalized allenes is reported. The direct and selective formation of allenic products preventing the corresponding isomeric propargylic product is accomplished by the choice of SPhos or XPhos based Pd catalysts. The methodology avoids the prior transmetalation to other transition metals or reverse approaches that required prefunctionalization of substrates with leaving groups, resulting in a fast and efficient approach for the synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenes. Experimental and theoretical studies on the mechanism show catalyst control of selectivity in this allene formation.

      <title>Magnetothermal Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted Hierarchical Microfibers for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
A magnetothermal microfluidic method was used to design hierarchical carbon polyhedrons/holey graphene core&#8211;shell microfibers for a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor. The supercapacitor displayed ultrahigh energy density, large areal capacitance, and endurance for self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
Chemical architectures with an ordered porous backbone and high charge transfer are significant for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). However, owing to the sluggish ion kinetic diffusion and storage in compacted fibers, achieving high energy density remains a challenge. An innovative magnetothermal microfluidic method is now proposed to design hierarchical carbon polyhedrons/holey graphene (CP/HG) core&#8211;shell microfibers. Owing to highly magnetothermal etching and microfluidic reactions, the CP/HG fibers maintain an open inner&#8208;linked ionic pathway, large specific surface area, and moderate nitrogen active site, facilitating more rapid ionic dynamic transportation and accommodation. The CP/HG FSCs show an ultrahigh energy density (335.8&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and large areal capacitance (2760&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A self&#8208;powered endurance application with the integration of chip&#8208;based FSCs is designed to profoundly drive the durable motions of an electric car and walking robot.

      <title>Oriented (Local) Electric Fields Drive the Millionfold Enhancement of the H&#8208;Abstraction Catalysis Observed for Synthetic Metalloenzyme Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
Field study: The catalysis of hydrogen abstraction by two synthetic metalloenzymes which contain positively charged substituents on their respective macrocyclic ligands is investigated. The observed enhancement of reactivity is purely of electrostatic origin and associated with differential destabilizations of the reactants and the transition state.







Abstract
This contribution follows the recent remarkable catalysis observed by Groves et&#8197;al. in hydrogen&#8208;abstraction reactions by a)&#8197;an oxoferryl porphyrin radical&#8208;cation complex [Por&#8901;+FeIV(O)Lax] and b)&#8197;a hydroxoiron porphyrazine ferric complex [PyPzFeIII(OH)Lax], both of which involve positively charged substituents on the outer circumference of the respective macrocyclic ligands. These charge&#8208;coronated complexes are analogues of the biologically important Compound I (Cpd&#8197;I) and synthetic hydroxoferric species, respectively. We demonstrate that the observed enhancement of the H&#8208;abstraction catalysis for these systems is a purely electrostatic effect, elicited by the local charges embedded on the peripheries of the respective macrocyclic ligands. Our findings provide new insights into how electrostatics can be employed to tune the catalytic activity of metalloenzymes and can thus contribute to the future design of new and highly efficient hydrogen&#8208;abstraction catalysts.

      <title>Rational Design of a Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Visualizing Monoamine Oxidase&#8197;A Activity in Human Glioma Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
Picking MAO&#8208;A: A novel two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (F1) is shown to successfully detect endogenous MAO&#8208;A activities in a variety of biological samples, including live mammalian cells, fresh mouse/human brain and tumor tissues, with minimal cytotoxicity and cross&#8208;reactivity toward MAO&#8208;B.







Abstract
Monoamine oxidases have two functionally distinct but structurally similar isoforms (MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B). The ability to differentiate them by using fluorescence detection/imaging technology is of significant biological relevance, but highly challenging with available chemical tools. Herein, we report the first MAO&#8208;A&#8208;specific two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (F1), capable of selective imaging of endogenous MAO&#8208;A enzymatic activities from a variety of biological samples, including MAO&#8208;A&#8208;expressing neuronal SY&#8208;SY5Y cells, the brain of tumor&#8208;bearing mice and human Glioma tissues by using two&#8208;photon fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) with minimal cytotoxicity.

      <dc:description>
A photoresponsive hydrogel was constructed by using a supramolecular design strategy. A red&#8208;shifted anthracene group furnishes the system with fast photo&#8208;actuation. Hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and anthracene photodimerization results in an actuator with high mechanical strength, fast self&#8208;healing, and recyclability.







Abstract
The most pressing challenges for light&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators include reliance on UV light, slow response, poor mechanical properties, and limited functionalities. Now, a supramolecular design strategy is used to address these issues. Key is the use of a benzylimine&#8208;functionalized anthracene group, which red&#8208;shifts the absorption into the visible region and also stabilizes the supramolecular network through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Acid&#8211;ether hydrogen bonds are incorporated for energy dissipation under mechanical deformation and maintaining hydrophilicity of the network. This double&#8208;crosslinked supramolecular hydrogel developed via a simple synthesis exhibits a unique combination of high strength, rapid self&#8208;healing, and fast visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven shape morphing both in the wet and dry state. As all of the interactions are dynamic, the design enables the structures to be recycled and reprogrammed into different 3D objects.

      <title>A Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Hybrid Membrane with High On/Off Photoswitchable Proton Conductivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;regulated proton conduction in MOF membranes was realized by in&#8197;situ encapsulation of light&#8208;active molecules into 3D frameworks. The hybrid membrane has high proton conductivity and outstanding switchable properties, making it feasible to control the lightening of a LED lamp assembled into an optically controlled circuit.







Abstract
Mimicking biological proton pumps to achieve stimuli&#8208;responsive protonic solids has long been of great interest for their diverse applications in fuel cells, chemical sensors, and bio&#8208;electronic devices. Now, dynamic light&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework hybrid membranes can be obtained by in&#8197;situ encapsulation of photoactive molecules (sulfonated spiropyran, SSP), as the molecular valve, into the cavities of the host ZIF&#8208;8. The configuration of SSP can be changed and switched reversibly in response to light, generating different mobile acidic protons and thus high on/off photoswitchable proton conductivity in the hybrid membranes and device. This device exhibits a high proton conductivity, fast response time, and extremely large on/off ratio upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. This approach might provide a platform for creating emerging smart protonic solids with potential applications in the remote&#8208;controllable chemical sensors or proton&#8208;conducting field&#8208;effect transistors.

      <title>Luminescent Metallacycle&#8208;Cored Liquid Crystals Induced by Metal Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>
Two luminescent rhomboidal metallacycles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties were prepared by metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. One of the metallacycles also was liquid&#8208;crystalline owing to the intermolecular packing of the metallacycles, indicating that the liquid&#8208;crystal properties could be induced by metal&#8208;coordination interactions.







Abstract
Two rhomboidal metallacycles based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly are presented. Because metal&#8208;coordination interactions restrict the rotation of phenyl groups on tetraphenylethene units, these metallacycles were emissive both in solution and in solid state, and their aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties were well&#8208;retained. Moreover, the rhomboidal metallacyclic structures offer a platform for intermolecular packing beneficial for the formation of liquid crystalline phases. Therefore, although neither of building blocks shows mesogenic properties, both thermotropic and lyotropic (in DMF) mesophases were observed in one of metallacycles, indicating that mesophases could be induced by metal&#8208;coordination interactions. This study not only reveals the mechanism for the formation of cavity&#8208;cored liquid crystals, but also provides a convenient approach to preparing supramolecular luminescent liquid crystals, which will serve as good candidates for chemo sensors and liquid crystal displays.

      <title>Metal Alkyls with Alkylidynic Metal&#8208;Carbon Bond Character: Key Electronic Structures in Alkane Metathesis Precatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Triple or nothing. Metal alkyls that display catalytic activity in alkane metathesis show particularly deshielded 13C chemical shifts and almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensors that indicate an alkylidynic character of the metal&#8208;carbon bonds. This electronic structure favors the formation of metal alkylidynes, which are key intermediates in alkane metathesis.







Abstract
The homologation of alkanes via alkane metathesis is catalyzed at low temperatures (150&#8201;&#176;C) by the silica&#8208;supported species (&#8801;SiO)WMe5 and (&#8801;SiO)TaMe4, while (&#8801;SiO)TaMe3Cp* is inactive. The contrasting reactivity is paralleled by differences in the 13C&#8197;NMR signature; the former display significantly more deshielded isotropic chemical shifts (&#948;iso) and almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensors, similar to what is observed in their molecular precursors TaMe5 and WMe6. Analysis of the chemical shift tensors reveals the presence of a triple&#8208;bond character in their metal&#8208;carbon (formally single) bond. This electronic structure is reflected in their propensity to generate alkylidynes and to participate in alkane metathesis, further supporting the role of alkylidynes as key reaction intermediates. This study establishes chemical shift as a descriptor to identify potential alkane metathesis catalysts.

      <title>Element&#8211;Element Bond Formation upon Oxidation and Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Unexpected E&#8722;E bond formation: The versatile redox chemistry of the polypnictogen cobalt complexes [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(E2)2] (E=P, As) was investigated. Both oxidation and reduction lead to the formation of two new E&#8722;E bonds and to the cyclization of the separated E2 ligands into E4 ligands in the coordination sphere of two {Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co} fragments.







Abstract
The redox chemistry of [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)2] (E=P (1), As (2); Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri(tert&#8208;butyl)cyclopentadienyl) was investigated. Both compounds can be oxidized and reduced twice. That way, the monocations [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;E4)][X] (E=P, X=BF4 (3&#8201;a), [FAl] (3&#8201;b); E=As, X=BF4 (4&#8201;a), [FAl] (4&#8201;b)), the dications [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;E4)][TEF]2 (E=P (5), As (6)), and the monoanions [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)(dme)2][(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;E4)] (E=P (7), As (8)) were isolated. Further reduction of 7 leads to the dianionic complex [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)(dme)2][K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)][(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P4)] (9), in which the cyclo&#8208;P4 ligand has rearranged to a chain&#8208;like P4 ligand. Further reduction of 8 can be achieved with an excess of potassium under the formation of [K(dme)4][(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;As3)] (10) and the elimination of an As1 unit. Compound 10 represents the first example of an allylic As3 ligand incorporated into a triple&#8208;decker complex.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Luminogens: A Material for Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging Independent of Probe Pretreatment and Probe Concentration</title>
      <dc:description>
Time will tell: Luminogens that efficiently emit thermally activated delayed fluorescence both in the monomeric and aggregated state are presented. Such a dual&#8208;phase strong and long&#8208;lived emission allows the material to be applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging, with an imaging efficiency that is independent of probe pretreatment and probe concentration.







Abstract
Developing luminescent probes with long lifetime and high emission efficiency is essential for time&#8208;resolved imaging. However, the practical applications usually suffer from emission quenching of traditional luminogens in aggregated states, or from weak emission of aggregation&#8208;induced emission type luminogens in monomeric states. Herein, we overcome this dilemma by a rigid&#8208;and&#8208;flexible alternation design in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor skeletons, to achieve a thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminogen with high emission efficiency both in the monomeric state (quantum yield up to 35.3&#8201;%) and in the aggregated state (quantum yield up to 30.8&#8201;%). Such a dual&#8208;phase strong and long&#8208;lived emission allows a time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging, with an efficiency independent of probe pretreatment and probe concentration. The findings open opportunities for developing luminescent probes with a usage in larger temporal and spatial scales.

      <title>EPR Distance Measurements on Long Non&#8208;coding RNAs Empowered by Genetic Alphabet Expansion Transcription</title>
      <dc:description>
UBPs meet EPR: Unnatural base pairs (UBPs) allow facile site&#8208;specific introduction of nitroxide spin labels into long RNAs by in&#8197;vitro transcription. Distances are determined in the glmS ribozyme and the 377&#8197;nt A&#8208;region of the long non&#8208;coding RNA Xist.







Abstract
We present herein a novel nitroxide spin label&#8208;containing RNA triphosphate TPT3NO and its application for site&#8208;specific spin&#8208;labeling of RNA through in&#8197;vitro transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Our strategy allows the facile preparation of spin&#8208;labeled RNAs with sizes ranging from short RNA oligonucleotides to large, complex RNA molecules with over 370 nucleotides by standard in&#8197;vitro transcription. As a proof of concept, inter&#8208;spin distance distributions are measured by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in short self&#8208;complementary RNA sequences and in a well&#8208;studied 185&#8197;nucleotide non&#8208;coding RNA, the B.&#8197;subtilis glmS ribozyme. The approach is then applied to probe for the first time the folding of the 377&#8197;nucleotide A&#8208;region of the long non&#8208;coding RNA Xist, by PELDOR.

      <title>Structural Diversification of Pillar[n]arene Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>
The next generation: Recent developments made in the field of pillar[n]arene&#8208;based macrocyclic molecules to go beyond single macrocyclic structures with two alkoxy&#8208;substituents on every benzene ring are highlighted. The recently introduced tiara[n]arenes, leaning pillar[n]arenes, and BowtieArenes with incomplete alkoxy substitution may be regarded as a next step in the structural diversification of pillar[n]arenes.







Abstract
Despite the fact that pillar[n]arenes receive major interest as building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and advanced materials, their functionalization is generally limited to the modification of the hydroxy or alkoxy units present on the rims. This limited structural freedom restricts further developments and has very recently been overcome. In this article, we highlight three very recent studies demonstrating further structural diversification of pillar[n]arenes by partial removal of the alkoxy substituents on the rims, which can be considered as the next generation of pillar[n]arenes.

      <title>Quantitative Prediction of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: A Full Quantum Mechanical Approach to the Optical Spectra</title>
      <dc:description>Full quantum mechanical (FQM) calculation of the excited state of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) materials is highly sought but still a challenging task. Herein, we employed the recently developed electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE&#8208;GMF) method, a method based on the systematic fragmentation approach, to predict, for the first time, the spectra of a prototype AIE fluorophore: di(  p  &#8208;methoxylphenyl) dibenzofulvene (FTPE). Compared to the single molecular or QM/MM calculations, the EE&#8208;GMF method can significantly improve the accuracy, nearly reproducing the experimental optical spectra of the FTPE in both condensed phases. Importantly, we show that the conventional restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) mechanism cannot fully account for AIE, whereas the two&#8208;body intermolecular quantum mechanical interaction plays a crucial role in AIE. The success in quantitative predicting optical properties of AIE systems not only validates the FQM fragmentation approach, but also enables more effective design of new AIE materials with novel optical properties.</dc:description>

Importantly, we show that the conventional restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) mechanism cannot fully account for AIE, whereas the two&#8208;body intermolecular quantum mechanical interaction plays a crucial role in AIE. The success in quantitative predicting optical properties of AIE systems not only validates the FQM fragmentation approach, but also enables more effective design of new AIE materials with novel optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Perdeuterated conjugated polymers for ultralow&#8208;frequency magnetic resonance of OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>Formation of excitons in OLEDs is spin dependent and can be controlled by electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance, affecting device resistance and electroluminescence yield. We explore electrically detected magnetic resonance in the regime of very low magnetic fields (&lt;1mT). A pronounced feature emerges at zero field in addition to the conventional spin&#8208;&#189; Zeeman resonance for which the Larmor frequency matches that of the incident radiation. By comparing a conventional p&#8208;conjugated polymer as the active material to a perdeuterated analogue, we demonstrate the interplay between zero&#8208;field feature and local hyperfine fields. The zero&#8208;field peak results from a quasistatic magnetic&#8208;field effect of the RF radiation for periods comparable to the carrier&#8208;pair lifetime. Zeeman resonances are resolved down to 3.2MHz, approximately twice the Larmor frequency of an electron in Earth&#8217;s field. However, since reducing hyperfine fields sharpens the Zeeman peak at the cost of an increased zero&#8208;field peak, we suggest that this result constitutes a fundamental low&#8208;field limit of magnetic resonance in carrier&#8208;pair&#8208;based systems. OLEDs offer an alternative solid&#8208;state platform to investigate the radical&#8208;pair mechanism of magnetic&#8208;field effects in photochemical reactions, allowing models of biological magnetoreception to be explored by measuring spin decoherence directly in the time domain.</dc:description>

      <title>Triplet Energy Transfer from Ruthenium Complexes to Chiral Eniminium Ions: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#173;carbaldehydes by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral eniminium salts were prepared from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and a chiral proline&#8208;derived secondary amine. Upon irradiation with visible light, the eniminium ions underwent a ruthenium catalyzed (2.5&#160;mol%) intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition to olefins which, after hydrolysis, led to chiral cyclobutanecarbaldehydes (17 examples, 49&#8208;74% yield). The simple diastereoselectivity (61/39 to 95/5  dr  ) and the enantioselectivity (83/17 to 96/4  er  ) of the reaction were high in most examples. Ru(bpz)  3  (PF  6  )  2  was utilized as the standard ruthenium catalyst and laser flash photolysis studies provided evidence that the catalyst operates exclusively by triplet energy transfer (sensitization). The triplet energy E  T  of the respective aldehydes from which the eniminium ions were prepared is significantly higher (E  T  &#160;&#8776;&#160;280&#8208;300&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8722;1  ) than the triplet energy of the eniminium ions (E  T  &#160;&#8776;&#160;200&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8722;1  ). Upon judicious selection of a suitable ruthenium complex a catalytic system was devised in which a chiral secondary amine acts as co&#8208;catalyst. Optimization of the [2+2] photocycloaddition between cinnamic aldehyde and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#173;butadiene resulted in conditions which operate with either 20 mol% (55% yield, 82/18  er  ) or 50 mol% (42% yield, 96/4  er  ) of a chiral amine and 2.5 mol% of the ruthenium complex. In the catalytic reactions, Ru(bpy)  3  (PF  6  )  2  was employed instead of Ru(bpz)  3  (PF  6  )  2  . In line with its photophysical and electrochemical data, Ru(bpy)  3  (PF  6  )  2  is sug&#173;gested by laser flash photolysis experiments to undergo both electron and energy transfer. However, evidence was collected to support the hypothesis that energy transfer is the only productive quenching mechanism.

      <title>Integrating Allyl Electrophiles into Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Conjunctive Cross&#8208;Coupling
</title>
      <dc:description>
Nickel catalysis enables regioselective 1,2&#8208;allylmethylation of unactivated alkenes in a variety of N&#8208;allyl heterocycles. The resulting alkene product remains untouched and can be easily diversified.







Abstract
Allylation and conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling represent two useful, yet largely distinct, reactivity paradigms in catalysis. The union of these two processes would offer exciting possibilities in organic synthesis but remains largely unknown. Herein, we report the use of allyl electrophiles in nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling with a non&#8208;conjugated alkene and dimethylzinc. The transformation is enabled by weakly coordinating, monodentate aza&#8208;heterocycle directing groups that are useful building blocks in synthesis, including saccharin, pyridones, pyrazoles, and triazoles. The reaction occurs under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of allyl electrophiles. High chemoselectivity through substrate directivity is demonstrated by the facile reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;&#947; alkene of the starting material, whereas the &#1013;&#8208;&#950; alkene of the product is preserved. The generality of this approach is further illustrated through the development of an analogous method with alkyne substrates. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of the dissociation of the weakly coordinating directing group to allow the allyl moiety to bind and facilitate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) reductive elimination.

      <title>Origins of Boosted Charge Storage on Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>
A complete landscape of boosted charge storage on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbons is uncovered mechanistically. Heteroatom doping effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, pushing the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes even beyond the thermodynamic limit of water (1.23&#8197;V). It also leads to a lower adsorption energy and consequently more stored cations on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon, yielding more charge storage.







Abstract
Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to understanding the origin of boosted charge storage on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbons, none of the present studies has shown a whole landscape. Herein, by both experimental evidence and theoretical simulation, it is demonstrated that heteroatom doping not only results in a broadened operating voltage, but also successfully promotes the specific capacitance in aqueous supercapacitors. In particular, the electrolyte cations adsorbed on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon can effectively inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction, a key step of water decomposition during the charging process, which broadens the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes even beyond the thermodynamic limit of water (1.23&#8197;V). Furthermore, the reduced adsorption energy of heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon consequently leads to more stored cations on the heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon surface, thus yielding a boosted charge storage performance.

      <title>Cupin Variants as a Macromolecular Ligand Library for Stereoselective Michael Addition of Nitroalkanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Rational alteration of the first and second coordination sphere within cupin protein produced robust artificial metalloenzymes. These mutants can catalyze enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent Michael addition reactions of nitroalkanes.







Abstract
Cupin superfamily proteins (TM1459) work as a macromolecular ligand framework with a double&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;barrel structure ligating to a Cu ion through histidine side chains. Variegating the first coordination sphere of TM1459 revealed that H52A and H54A/H58A mutants effectively catalyzed the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Michael addition reaction of nitroalkanes to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone. Moreover, calculated substrate docking signified C106N and F104W single&#8208;point mutations, which inverted the diastereoselectivity of H52A and further improved the stereoselectivity of H54A/H58A, respectively.

Abstract
Helical carbazole&#8208;based BODIPY analogues were readily synthesized via aza[7]helicenes. The structures of azahelicene&#8208;incorporated BF2 dyes were elucidated by x&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system expanded from the helicene moiety to the BODIPY framework. The azahelicene&#8208;fused boron complexes showed the Cotton effects and the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the visible region. Furthermore, an axially chiral binaphthyl group was attached to the helically chiral dyes, which enhanced the chiroptical properties.

      <title>Heterotrimetallic Mixed&#8208;Valent Molecular Precursors Containing Periodic Table Neighbors:  Assignment of Metal Positions and Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>Design, synthesis, and authentication of a new family of hetero  tri  metallic molecular precursors are described. A known trinuclear structure was selected to design a new hetero  bi  metallic mixed&#8208;valent, mixed&#8208;ligand molecule [Co  II  (hfac)  3  &#8208;Na&#8208;Co  III  (acac)  3  ] (  1  ). The latter was utilized as a model template structure to develop hetero  tri  metallic molecules [Co  II  (hfac)  3  &#8208;Na&#8208;Fe  III  (acac)  3  ] (  2  ) and [Ni  II  (hfac)  3  &#8208;Na&#8208;Co  III  (acac)  3  ] (  3  )  via  isovalent site&#8208;specific substitution at either of the cobalt positions. Advanced diffraction methods, synchrotron resonant diffraction and multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction, have been successfully applied beyond simple structural investigation to provide an unambiguous assignment of the positions and oxidation states for the Periodic Table neighbors in the heterometallic assemblies. Molecules of  2  and  3  were shown to be true hetero  tri  metallic rather than a statistical mixture of two hetero  bi  metallic counterparts. The key for accommodating two 3  d  transition metals with close atomic numbers, radii, and coordination numbers within the same molecule was to create sufficiently different individual coordination environments. That was achieved by using divalent and trivalent oxidation states as well as by employing electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating ligands to chelate electron&#8208;richer and &#8208;poorer metal centers, respectively. This study clearly indicates that the title unique trinuclear platform  1  exhibits flexibility in accommodating a great variety of divalent and trivalent metals, which can be further utilized in the design of hetero  tri  metallic molecular precursors with the Na:M:M' = 1:1:1 ratio for preparation of the corresponding NaMM'O  4  functional oxide materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A Benchtop Method for Appending Protic Functional Groups to N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Protected Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
A straightforward and robust method to functionalize SERS&#8208;active gold nanoparticles with bifunctional N&#8208;heterocsyclic carbenes is presented. The method gives access to amine&#8208;functionalized surfaces and enables the amide coupling to be monitored by SERS.







Abstract
The remarkable resilience of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) gold bonds has quickly made NHCs the ligand of choice when functionalizing gold surfaces. Despite rapid progress using deposition from free or CO2&#8208;protected NHCs, synthetic challenges hinder the functionalization of NHC surfaces with protic functional groups, such as alcohols and amines, particularly on larger nanoparticles. Here, we synthesize NHC&#8208;functionalized gold surfaces from gold(I) NHC complexes and aqueous nanoparticles without the need for additional reagents, enabling otherwise difficult functional groups to be appended to the carbene. The resilience of the NHC&#8722;Au bond allows for multi&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. Beginning with the nitro&#8208;NHC, we form an amine&#8208;NHC terminated surface, which further undergoes amide coupling with carboxylic acids. The simplicity of this approach, its compatibility with aqueous nanoparticle solutions, and its ability to yield protic functionality, greatly expands the potential of NHC&#8208;functionalized noble metal surfaces.

      <title>Controlling Gas Selectivity in Molecular Porous Liquids by Tuning the Cage Window Size</title>
      <dc:description>
Control of pore window size: Narrowing the windows of the organic cage used to form molecular porous liquids leads to tuning of the gas selectivity. Pulsed&#8208;field gradient NMR spectroscopy is used to understand the selectivity.







Abstract
Control of pore window size is the standard approach for tuning gas selectivity in porous solids. Here, we present the first example where this is translated into a molecular porous liquid formed from organic cage molecules. Reduction of the cage window size by chemical synthesis switches the selectivity from Xe&#8208;selective to CH4&#8208;selective, which is understood using 129Xe, 1H, and pulsed&#8208;field gradient NMR spectroscopy.

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Activation at Metal Centers: Evolution of Charge Transfer from Mg&#8201;.+ to CO2 in [MgCO2(H2O)n].+, n=0&#8211;8</title>
      <dc:description>
One, two, three: Three water molecules activate carbon dioxide when coordinated to Mg&#8201;.+ in the gas phase, pushing electron density from the magnesium center since they are keen on interacting with an Mg2+ ion. For the same reason, they squeeze in between CO2.&#8722; and the metal center if there are five or more. This sequence of electron transfer followed by formation of a solvent&#8208;separated ion pair is unraveled by infrared spectroscopy.







Abstract
We investigate activation of carbon dioxide by singly charged hydrated magnesium cations Mg&#8201;.+(H2O)n, through infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The spectra of [MgCO2(H2O)n].+ in the 1250&#8211;4000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region show a sharp transition from n=2 to n=3 for the position of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode. This is evidence for the activation of CO2 via charge transfer from Mg&#8201;.+ to CO2 for n&#8805;3, while smaller clusters feature linear CO2 coordinated end&#8208;on to the metal center. Starting with n=5, we see a further conformational change, with CO2.&#8722; coordination to Mg2+ gradually shifting from bidentate to monodentate, consistent with preferential hexa&#8208;coordination of Mg2+. Our results reveal in detail how hydration promotes CO2 activation by charge transfer at metal centers.

Abstract
To show the synthetic utility of the catalytic C&#8722;C activation of less strained substrates, described here are the collective and concise syntheses of the natural products (&#8722;)&#8208;microthecaline&#8197;A, (&#8722;)&#8208;leubehanol, (+)&#8208;pseudopteroxazole, (+)&#8208;seco&#8208;pseudopteroxazole, pseudopterosin&#8197;A&#8211;F and G&#8212;J aglycones, and (+)&#8208;heritonin. The key step in these syntheses involve a Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H activation cascade of 3&#8208;arylcyclopentanones, which provides a rapid and enantioselective route to access the polysubstituted tetrahydronaphthalene cores presented in these natural products. Other important features include 1)&#8197;the direct C&#8722;H amination of the tetralone substrate in the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;microthecaline&#8197;A, 2)&#8197;the use of phosphoric acid to enhance efficiency and regioselectivity for problematic cyclopentanone substrates in the C&#8722;C activation reactions, and 3)&#8197;the direct conversion of serrulatane into amphilectane diterpenes by an allylic cyclodehydrogenation coupling.

      <title>A Glutathione Activatable Ion Channel Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells by Depleting Intracellular Glutathione Levels</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer cells use elevated glutathione (GSH) levels as an inner line of defense to evade apoptosis and develop drug resistance. A 2,4&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl&#8208;protected 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide is described that compromises intracellular glutathione defense by activation of ion channels leading to production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis.







Abstract
Cancer cells use elevated glutathione (GSH) levels as an inner line of defense to evade apoptosis and develop drug resistance. In this study, we describe a novel 2,4&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNS) protected 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide system that exploits GSH for its activation into free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide forming supramolecular M+/Cl&#8722; channels. Better permeation of the DNS protected compound into MCF&#8208;7 cells compared to the free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide and GSH&#8208;activatable ion transport resulted in higher cytotoxicity, which was associated with increased oxidative stress that further reduced the intracellular GSH levels and altered mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The GSH&#8208;activatable transport&#8208;mediated cell death was further validated in rat insulinoma cells (INS&#8208;1E); wherein the intracellular GSH levels showed a direct correlation to the resulting cytotoxicity. Lastly, the active compound was found to restrict the growth and proliferation of 3D spheroids of MCF&#8208;7 cells with efficiency similar to that of the anticancer drug doxorubicin.

The GSH&#8208;activatable transport&#8208;mediated cell death was further validated in rat insulinoma cells (&lt;i&gt;INS&#8208;1E&lt;/i&gt;); wherein the intracellular GSH levels showed a direct correlation to the resulting cytotoxicity. Lastly, the active compound was found to restrict the growth and proliferation of 3D spheroids of MCF&#8208;7 cells with efficiency similar to that of the anticancer drug doxorubicin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catalytic Regioselective Isomerization of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes to Homoallylic Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Ring strain: 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted oxetanes, easily prepared by a double Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reaction, readily isomerize into homoallylic alcohols using B(C6F5)3 as a catalyst. DFT calculations show a key intramolecular proton migration. The synthetic potential was proven by the synthesis of several chiral disubstituted alcohols, with high enantiomeric excesses, by asymmetric hydrogenation of the homoallylic alcohols.







Abstract
The selective isomerization of strained heterocyclic compounds is an important tool in organic synthesis. An unprecedented regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes into homoallylic alcohols is described. The use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3), a commercially available Lewis acid was key to obtaining good yields and selectivities since other Lewis acids afforded mixtures of isomers and substantial polymerization. The reaction took place under exceptionally mild reaction conditions and very low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%). DFT calculations disclose the mechanistic features of the isomerization and account for the high selectivity displayed by the B(C6F5)3 catalyst. The synthetic applicability of the new reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of &#947;&#8208;chiral alcohols using iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.

      <title>Distal Allylic/Benzylic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Silyl Ethers Using Donor/Acceptor Rhodium(II) Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;H functionalization: Distal selective allylic/benzylic C&#8722;H functionalization of silyl ethers were developed by means of donor/acceptor carbene intermediates. The reactions proceed with high levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The potential of this methodology was illustrated by accessing a synthetically important heterocyclic scaffold.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective distal allylic/benzylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl and benzyl silyl ethers was achieved using rhodium(II) carbenes derived from N&#8208;sulfonyltriazoles and aryldiazoacetates as carbene precursors. The bulky rhodium carbenes led to highly site&#8208;selective functionalization of less activated allylic and benzylic C&#8722;H bonds even in the presence of electronically preferred C&#8722;H bonds located &#945; to oxygen. The dirhodium catalyst Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4 is the most effective chiral catalyst for triazole&#8208;derived carbene transformations, whereas Rh2(S&#8208;TPPTTL)4 works best for carbenes derived from aryldiazoacetates. The reactions afford a variety of &#948;&#8208;functionalized allyl silyl ethers with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The utility of the present method was demonstrated by its application to the synthesis of a 3,4&#8208;disubstituted l&#8208;proline scaffold.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Chemotherapy by Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Differential Stress Sensitization</title>
      <dc:description>Most of current nanomedicines are administrated intravenously to favour tumor accumulation via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which, however, suffers from a number of drawbacks such as low drug bioavailability and severe side effect. Inspired from the advances in nutriology, in this work, we have constructed a doxorubicin(Dox)&#8208;based liposomal nanosystem, whose component is analogous to that of FDA&#8208;approved cancer nanomedicine Doxil  &#174;  , for tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy by enabling differential stress sensitization between cancer and normal cells for restricting the chemodrug toxicity exclusively in tumor regions. In detail, 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (2DG) was loaded in the nanoliposome to inhibit glycolysis of cancer cells, which works in synergy with the co&#8208;loaded chemodrug Dox to promote mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent apoptosis. In the meantime, the starvation effect of 2DG is able to counteract the toxicity of Dox in normal cells and thus mitigates the harmful side effect of chemotherapy. In vivo results also evidence that this engineered nanosystem features largely elevated therapeutic efficacy, mitigated side effects, as well as distinct anti&#8208;metastasis function. It is expected that such a differential stress sensitization strategy may greatly benefit future nanomedicine design.</dc:description>

Inspired from the advances in nutriology, in this work, we have constructed a doxorubicin(Dox)&#8208;based liposomal nanosystem, whose component is analogous to that of FDA&#8208;approved cancer nanomedicine Doxil  &#174;  , for tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy by enabling differential stress sensitization between cancer and normal cells for restricting the chemodrug toxicity exclusively in tumor regions. In detail, 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (2DG) was loaded in the nanoliposome to inhibit glycolysis of cancer cells, which works in synergy with the co&#8208;loaded chemodrug Dox to promote mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent apoptosis. In the meantime, the starvation effect of 2DG is able to counteract the toxicity of Dox in normal cells and thus mitigates the harmful side effect of chemotherapy. In vivo results also evidence that this engineered nanosystem features largely elevated therapeutic efficacy, mitigated side effects, as well as distinct anti&#8208;metastasis function. It is expected that such a differential stress sensitization strategy may greatly benefit future nanomedicine design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Achieving Morphological Control over Lamellar Manganese Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Modulated Bi&#8208;phase Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials offer wealth of applications depending on if they are crystallized in bulk or layered nature. However, the control over this morphology is difficult especially for those involving metal cations with low electronegativity and uncontrollable kinetic reaction. Here, we report modulated bi&#8208;phase synthesis route towards large&#8208;scale manganese 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate (MnBDC) with a precise control over their morphology i.e., bulk vs layered. In this bi&#8208;phase method, metal precursors and organic ligands are separated to reduce the kinetic reaction rates for better control over the crystallization process. Based on scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy studies, we find that the continuous ligand supply along with the presence of pyridine capping agent are highly effective in promoting the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth and achieving large crystal sizes. Once layered MnBDC is stabilized, we further used topotactic intercalation chemistry to demonstrate the feasibility of bromine intercalation on these layered materials. Comprehensive studies show that bromine intercalation is possible between the MOFs layers for the first time. Interestingly, bromine intercalation causes colossal reduction in layered MnBDC band gap while it has no observable effect on bulk MOFs. Overall results introduce novel manufacturing concepts to realize lamellar MOFs containing challenging metal cations and offer fundamental insights into their material properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused&#8208;Quinoxaline as Key Building Block for Highly Efficient and Stable Sensitizers in Copper Electrolyte Based Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on Cu(II/I) bipyridyl or phenanthroline complexes as redox shuttles have achieved very high open&#8208;circuit voltages (  V  OC  , &gt; 1 V). However, their short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (  J  SC  ) has remained modest. The challenge for increasing the  J  SC  is expected to extend the spectral response of sensitizers to the red or NIR region while maintaining efficient electron injection in the mesoscopic TiO  2  film and fast regeneration by the Cu(I) complex. Here, we report two new D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A featured sensitizers coded  HY63  and  HY64  , which employ either benzothiadiazole (BT) or phenanthrene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (PFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;withdrawing acceptor moiety. In spite of very similar energy levels and absorption onsets,  HY64  &#8208;based DSSCs outperform largely their  HY63  counterpart, achieving an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5% with superior stability. In depth studies of interfacial charge carrier dynamics show that PFQ is superior to BT in retarding charge recombination resulting in near quantitative collection of photogenerated charge carriers.</dc:description>

      <title>Beyond Mechanical Recycling: Giving New Life to Plastic Waste</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing the stream of recycled plastic from currently 12 wt.% necessitates an approach beyond traditional low value recycling via melting and re&#8208;extrusion. Various chemical recycling processes have great potential to enhance recycling rates, because a higher variety of plastic waste streams can be recycled leading to a higher purity and quality product than melting and re&#8208;extrusion. But despite long&#8208;standing efforts, commercial processes are still not operated at the volumes to address the recycling necessity. In this review, a summary of the various chemical recycling routes and assessment via life cycle analysis is complemented by a&#160;list of processes developed by companies active in chemical recycling. We show that each of the currently available processes is applicable for specific plastic waste streams. Thus, only a combination of different technologies can address the plastic waste problem. While pyrolysis can handle relatively mixed waste streams, it works best with polyolefins, PS and PMMA. Contaminations including PVC, PET and PU and non&#8208;plastic additives like glass fiber cause operational problems. Multilayer plastics containing these materials are best separated into mono&#8208;streams by dissolution/precipitation. Pure polyester or polyamide waste streams can be recycled by solvolysis techniques with high monomer recovery. Research should focus on more realistic, more contaminated and mixed waste streams, while collection and sorting infrastructure will need to be improved, i.e. by stricter regulation. This review aims to inspire both science and innovation for the production of higher value and quality products from plastic recycling suitable for reuse or valorization to create the necessary economic and environmental push for a circular economy.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of galactosyl&#8208;queuosine and distribution of hypermodified Q&#8208;nucleosides in mouse tissues</title>
      <dc:description>Queuosine (Q) is a hypermodified RNA nucleoside that is found in tRNA  His  , tRNA  Asn  , tRNA  Tyr  , and tRNA  Asp  . It is located at the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon loop, where it can interact both with U or C bases located at the respective position of the corresponding mRNA codons. In higher eukaryotes, including humans, the Q base is for yet unknown reasons further modified in tRNA  Tyr  and tRNA  Asp  by the addition of a galactose or mannose sugar, respectively. The reason for this additional modification, and how the sugar modification is orchestrated with Q&#8208;formation and insertion, is unknown. Here, we report a total synthesis of the hypermodified nucleoside galactosyl&#8208;queuosine (galQ). The availability of the compound enabled us to study the absolute levels of the Q&#8208;family nucleosides in six different organs of new&#8208;born and adult mice, and also in human cytosolic tRNA. Our synthesis now paves the way to a more detailed analysis of the biological function of the Q&#8208;nucleoside family.</dc:description>

      <title>Observation of Ion Electrosorption in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Micropores with in operando Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular&#8208;level understanding of transport and adsorption mechanisms of electrolyte ions in nanoporous electrodes under applied potentials is essential to control the performance of double layer capacitors for rapidly emerging high power energy storage. Here  in operando  small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to directly detect ion movements into the nanopores of a conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) electrode under operating conditions. Neutron scattering data reveals that most of the void space within the MOF is accessible to the solvent. Upon the addition of the electrolyte NaOTF, the ions are adsorbed on the outer surface of the protrusions to form a 30 &#197; layer instead of entering the ionophobic pores in the absence of an applied charging potential. The changes in scattering intensity when potentials are applied suggests the ion rearrangement in the micropores following different mechanisms depending on the electrode polarization. These observations shed new insights on ion electrosorption in electrode materials.</dc:description>

Here  in operando  small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to directly detect ion movements into the nanopores of a conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) electrode under operating conditions. Neutron scattering data reveals that most of the void space within the MOF is accessible to the solvent. Upon the addition of the electrolyte NaOTF, the ions are adsorbed on the outer surface of the protrusions to form a 30 &#197; layer instead of entering the ionophobic pores in the absence of an applied charging potential. The changes in scattering intensity when potentials are applied suggests the ion rearrangement in the micropores following different mechanisms depending on the electrode polarization. These observations shed new insights on ion electrosorption in electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Approaching the Integer&#8208;Charge Transfer Regime in Molecularly Doped Oligothiophenes by Efficient Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Symmetrical linear oligothiophenes are important model organic semiconductors. A library of such oligothiophenes was synthesized by an efficient decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling route. These compounds enable the critical oligomer length for integer&#8208;charge transfer upon molecular doping to be explored, thereby connecting the fundamentally different doping phenomenologies of oligo&#8208; and polythiophenes.







Abstract
A library of symmetrical linear oligothiophene was prepared employing decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key transformation. Thiophene potassium carboxylate salts were used as cross&#8208;coupling partners without the need of co&#8208;catalyst, base, or additives. This method demonstrates complete chemoselectivity and is a comprehensive greener approach compared to the existing methods. The modularity of this approach is demonstrated with the preparation of discreet oligothiophenes with up to 10 thiophene repeat units. Symmetrical oligothiophenes are prototypical organic semiconductors where their molecular electrical doping as a function of the chain length can be assessed spectroscopically. An oligothiophene critical length for integer charge transfer was observed to be 10 thiophene units, highlighting the potential use of discrete oligothiophenes as doped conduction or injection layers in organic electronics applications.

      <title>A Multi&#8208;action and Multi&#8208;target RuII&#8211;PtIV Conjugate Combining Cancer&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy to Overcome Drug Resistant Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>
Medicinal metal match: The treatment of cancer remains a major challenge in modern medicine. Herein, a novel approach combining a PtIV complex as chemotherapeutic drug and a RuII complex as an agent for photodynamic therapy is presented. The conjugate demonstrated to act on various cellular compartments with different mechanism on 2D monolayer cells as well as 3D multicellular tumor spheroids.







Abstract
PtII complexes are commonly used to treat cancer. To reduce their side effects and improve their pharmacological properties, PtIV complexes are being developed as prodrug candidates that are activated by reduction in cancer cells. Concomitantly, RuII polypyridine complexes have gained much attention as photosensitizers for use in photodynamic therapy due to their attractive characteristics. In this article, a novel PtIV&#8211;RuII conjugate, which combines cancer activated chemotherapy with PDT, is presented. Upon entering the cancer cell, the PtIV centre is reduced to PtII and the axial ligands including the RuII complex and phenylbutyrate are released. As each component has its individual targets, the conjugate exerts a multi&#8208;target and multi&#8208;action effect with (photo&#8208;)cytotoxicity values upon irradiation up to 595&#8197;nm in the low nanomolar range in various (drug resistant) 2D monolayer cancer cells and 3D multicellular tumour spheroids.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition A Multi&#8208;action and Multi&#8208;target RuII&#8211;PtIV Conjugate Combining Cancer&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy to Overcome Drug Resistant Cancers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medicinal metal match&lt;/b&gt;: The treatment of cancer remains a major challenge in modern medicine. Herein, a novel approach combining a Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complex as chemotherapeutic drug and a Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex as an agent for photodynamic therapy is presented. The conjugate demonstrated to act on various cellular compartments with different mechanism on 2D monolayer cells as well as 3D multicellular tumor spheroids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are commonly used to treat cancer. To reduce their side effects and improve their pharmacological properties, Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are being developed as prodrug candidates that are activated by reduction in cancer cells. Concomitantly, Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; polypyridine complexes have gained much attention as photosensitizers for use in photodynamic therapy due to their attractive characteristics. In this article, a novel Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; conjugate, which combines cancer activated chemotherapy with PDT, is presented. Upon entering the cancer cell, the Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; centre is reduced to Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and the axial ligands including the Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex and phenylbutyrate are released. As each component has its individual targets, the conjugate exerts a multi&#8208;target and multi&#8208;action effect with (photo&#8208;)cytotoxicity values upon irradiation up to 595&#8197;nm in the low nanomolar range in various (drug resistant) 2D monolayer cancer cells and 3D multicellular tumour spheroids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polarity Umpolung Strategy for the Radical Alkylation of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Polarity switch: A novel, mild, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute protocol for radical alkylation of alkenes was developed using a polarity umpolung strategy. Both activated and challenging unactivated alkenes are suitable substrates. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.







Abstract
Free radical mediated alkylation of alkenes is a challenging and largely unmet goal. Disclosed here is a conceptually novel &#8220;polarity umpolung&#8221; strategy for radical alkylation of alkenes using a portfolio of easily accessed, difunctional alkylating reagents. This strategy is achieved by substituting inherently nucleophilic alkyl radicals with electrophilic sulfone&#8208;bearing surrogates, thus inverting the usual mode of reactivity. Along with alkylation, either an heteroaryl or oximino group is concurrently incorporated into the alkenes by a consecutive docking and migration process, leading to valuable products. The reaction displays a broad functional&#8208;group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.

      <title>Strong and Confined Acids Control Five Stereogenic Centers in Catalytic Asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclohexadienones with Cyclopentadiene</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cross&#8208;conjugated dienones containing electronically unbiased quaternary centers with cyclopentadiene has been developed. The chiral microenvironment and greater acidity of the imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) Br&#248;nsted acid motif control the desired outcome. The resulting cycloaddition adducts contain up to five stereogenic centers.







Abstract
We describe a highly enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cross&#8208;conjugated cyclohexadienones with cyclopentadiene, in which five stereocenters are effectively controlled by a strongly acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidate catalyst. Our approach provides tricyclic products in excellent stereoselectivity. We also report methods to convert the obtained products into useful intermediates and a computational study that aids in gaining deeper insight into the reaction mechanism and origin of stereoselectivity.

      <title>Reversible Assembly of Microgels by Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Assemble&#8211;freeze&#8211;disassemble: Tailor&#8208;made terpyridine&#8208;functionalized PNiPAM microgels form a reversible supramolecular assembly. It freezes by formation of metallo&#8208;supramolecular links between microgels, followed by oxidation&#8208;responsive disassembly.







Abstract
The combination of supramolecular chemistry and soft colloids as microgels represents an ambitious way to develop multi&#8208;versatile colloidal assemblies. Hereafter, terpyridine&#8208;functionalized poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgel building blocks are shown to undergo an assemble&#8211;freeze&#8211;disassemble process. The microgel assemblies, which are controlled by monitoring the attractive and repulsive potentials between the soft colloidal particles, are then frozen by forming inter&#8208;particle metal&#8211;terpyridine bis&#8208;complexes upon addition of the metallic cation (such as FeII, CoII). By oxidation of the metal&#8211;terpyridine bis&#8208;complex links, the aggregates open up, which is due to the complex dissociation releasing the connected particles in the form of single microgels. We extended our work to the development of 1D filaments and 2D membranes materials made of soft particles connected via supramolecular chemistry.

      <title>An AIE&#8208;Active Conjugated Polymer with High ROS&#8208;Generation Ability and Biocompatibility for Efficient Photodynamic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Sunlight is the best disinfectant: A benzothiadiazole and tetraphenylethene&#8208;containing conjugated polymer (PTB&#8208;APFB) with high ROS&#8208;generation ability and selectivity for pathogenic microorganisms over mammalian cells was developed. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results show that PTB&#8208;APFB inhibits growth of bacteria efficiently, leading to recovery from infection 3&#8197;days faster than cefalotin.







Abstract
New, biocompatible materials with favorable antibacterial activity are highly desirable. In this work, we develop a unique conjugated polymer featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) for reliable bacterial eradication. Thanks to the AIE and donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure, this polymer shows a high reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generation ability compared to a low&#8208;mass model compound and the common photosensitizer Chlorin E6. Moreover, the selective binding of pathogenic microorganisms over mammalian cells was found, demonstrating its biocompatibility. The effective growth inhibition of bacteria upon polymer treatment under light irradiation was validated in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Notably, the recovery from infection after treatment with our polymer is faster than that with cefalotin. Thus, this polymer holds great promise in fighting against bacteria&#8208;related infections in practical applications.

The catalyst is obtained via pyrolysis of a polymer ionic liquid with a CoCl42&#8722; counter&#8208;anion on a carbon support and shows unprecedented activity in these reactions.







Abstract
Core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts are attractive due to their versatility and stability. Here, we describe cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated within graphitic shells prepared via the pyrolysis of a cationic poly&#8208;ionic liquid (PIL) with a cobalt(II) chloride anion. The resulting material has a core&#8211;shell structure that displays excellent activity and selectivity in the self&#8208;dehydrogenation and hetero&#8208;dehydrogenation of primary amines to their corresponding imines. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the synthesis of secondary imines from substrates with various reducible functional groups (C=C, C&#8801;C and C&#8801;N) and amino acid derivatives.

Abstract
Despite recent advances, reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity remain significant obstacles for the practical application of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization methods. Here, we describe a system that combines a salicylic&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;derived L,X&#8208;type directing group with an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand to enable the &#946;&#8208;methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic alcohols, which has not been possible previously. Notably, this protocol is compatible with heterocycles embedded in both alcohol substrates and aryl coupling partners. A site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;specific annulation of dihydrocholesterol and the synthesis of a key intermediate of englitazone illustrate the practicality of this method.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The palladium&#8208;catalyzed&lt;/b&gt; &#946;&#8208;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic alcohols was realized by the combination of a new L,X&#8208;type bidentate directing group and a 2&#8208;pyridone ligand. A site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;specific annulation of dihydrocholesterol and the synthesis of a key intermediate of englitazone illustrate the practicality of this method.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent advances, reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity remain significant obstacles for the practical application of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond functionalization methods. Here, we describe a system that combines a salicylic&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;derived L,X&#8208;type directing group with an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand to enable the &#946;&#8208;methylene C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic alcohols, which has not been possible previously. Notably, this protocol is compatible with heterocycles embedded in both alcohol substrates and aryl coupling partners. A site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;specific annulation of dihydrocholesterol and the synthesis of a key intermediate of englitazone illustrate the practicality of this method.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bisphosphine Derivatives through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Hydrophosphination</title>
      <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric conjugate hydrophosphination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfides with diarylphosphines allows rapid construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine derivatives with diversified electronic nature and steric hindrance. This reaction is facilitated by the &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; interaction between copper(I) catalysts and phosphine sulfides.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Bisphosphines have been identified as one class of important and powerful chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis with transition metals. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfides was developed with the assistance of &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; interaction between copper(I)&#8208;catalyst and the phosphine sulfide moiety, which afforded 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine derivatives with diversified electronic nature and steric hindrance in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, the challenging catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphination/protonation reaction was achieved with excellent enantioselectivity. Strikingly, the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic diarylphosphines was also successfully carried out with high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Interestingly, the nucleophilic copper(I)&#8208;diphenylphosphide species was characterized by 31P&#8197;NMR spectrum and mass spectrum. At last, three products were transformed to chiral 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines, which were employed as ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester. The &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative was produced in high enantioselectivity, which demonstrated the utility of the present methodology.

      <dc:description>ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanoboxes with accessible meso&#8208;micro&#8208;pore architecture and strong acid sites are important to heterogeneous catalysis suffering from mass transfer limitations and weak acidities.

The parent MFI zeolite was prepared by a strategy of rapid ageing of the zeolite sol gel synthesis mixture. The accessibility to the well&#8208;developed meso&#8208;micro&#8208;porous intra&#8208;crystalline network was probed systematically by comparative pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8208;NMR) diffusion measurements, which, in synergy with the high concentration of strong acidity of nanoboxes, provided superb catalytic activity and catalyst longevity in hydrocarbon cracking for producing propylene.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
A flexible chemical platform is described for the conversion of bioethanol into three distinct specialty chemical building blocks at high yields: crotonic acid (i, 62&#8201;%), 3&#8208;hydroxy butanoic acid (ii, 29&#8201;%), and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyacid (iii, 21&#8201;%).

Abstract
We report a reaction platform for the synthesis of three different high&#8208;value specialty chemical building blocks starting from bio&#8208;ethanol, which might have an important impact in the implementation of biorefineries. First, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde generates an aldehyde&#8208;containing stream active for the production of C4 aldehydes via base&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;condensation. Then, the resulting C4 adduct is selectively converted into crotonic acid via catalytic aerobic oxidation (62&#8201;% yield). Using a sequential epoxidation and hydrogenation of crotonic acid leads to 29&#8201;% yield of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acid (3&#8208;hydroxybutanoic acid). By controlling the pH of the reaction media, it is possible to hydrolyze the oxirane moiety leading to 21&#8201;% yield of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy acid (2,3&#8208;dihydroxybutanoic acid). Crotonic acid, 3&#8208;hydroxybutanoic acid, and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybutanoic acid are archetypal specialty chemicals used in the synthesis of polyvinyl&#8208;co&#8208;unsaturated acids resins, pharmaceutics, and bio&#8208;degradable/ &#8208;compatible polymers, respectively.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Acids and Hydroxy Acids by Tandem Oxidation, Epoxidation, and Hydrolysis/Hydrogenation of Bioethanol Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A flexible chemical platform&lt;/b&gt; is described for the conversion of bioethanol into three distinct specialty chemical building blocks at high yields: crotonic acid (i, 62&#8201;%), 3&#8208;hydroxy butanoic acid (ii, 29&#8201;%), and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyacid (iii, 21&#8201;%). The products can serve as basis for the production of numerous high&#8208;value chemicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a reaction platform for the synthesis of three different high&#8208;value specialty chemical building blocks starting from bio&#8208;ethanol, which might have an important impact in the implementation of biorefineries. First, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde generates an aldehyde&#8208;containing stream active for the production of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; aldehydes via base&#8208;catalyzed aldol&#8208;condensation. Then, the resulting C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adduct is selectively converted into crotonic acid via catalytic aerobic oxidation (62&#8201;% yield). Using a sequential epoxidation and hydrogenation of crotonic acid leads to 29&#8201;% yield of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acid (3&#8208;hydroxybutanoic acid). By controlling the pH of the reaction media, it is possible to hydrolyze the oxirane moiety leading to 21&#8201;% yield of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy acid (2,3&#8208;dihydroxybutanoic acid). Crotonic acid, 3&#8208;hydroxybutanoic acid, and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybutanoic acid are archetypal specialty chemicals used in the synthesis of polyvinyl&#8208;co&#8208;unsaturated acids resins, pharmaceutics, and bio&#8208;degradable/ &#8208;compatible polymers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular Indole C2&#8208;Allylation</title>
      <dc:description>
An enantioselective C2&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;substituted indoles is reported, providing C2&#8208;allylated products with excellent regiocontrol. Experimental studies and DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via direct C2&#8208;allylation with steric congestion at the indole&#8208;C3 position and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions identified as major contributors to the selectivity observed.







Abstract
The enantioselective intermolecular C2&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;substituted indoles is reported for the first time. This directing group&#8208;free approach relies on a chiral Ir&#8208;(P, olefin) complex and Mg(ClO4)2 Lewis acid catalyst system to promote allylic substitution, providing the C2&#8208;allylated products in typically high yields (40&#8211;99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (83&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) with excellent regiocontrol. Experimental studies and DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via direct C2&#8208;allylation, rather than C3&#8208;allylation followed by in situ migration. Steric congestion at the indole&#8208;C3 position and improved &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions have been identified as major contributors to the C2&#8208;selectivity.

Abstract
DNA encoded libraries (DEL) have shown promise as a valuable technology for democratizing the hit discovery process. Although DEL provides relatively inexpensive access to libraries of unprecedented size, their production has been hampered by the idiosyncratic needs of the encoding DNA tag relegating DEL compatible chemistry to dilute aqueous environments. Recently reversible adsorption to solid support (RASS) has been demonstrated as a promising method to expand DEL reactivity using standard organic synthesis protocols. Here we demonstrate a suite of on&#8208;DNA chemistries to incorporate medicinally relevant and C&#8722;S, C&#8722;P and N&#8722;S linkages into DELs, which are underrepresented in the canonical methods.

      <title>A Molecular Strategy to Lock&#8208;in the Conformation of a Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular polymers delivers a new class of robust, &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanoscale objects. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements elucidate the unique optoelectronic properties of this semiconducting superstructures.







Abstract
Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular assemblies provides a new avenue to regulate the (opto)electronic properties of robust nanoscale objects. In the present contribution, we show that the covalent tethering of a perylene bisimide (PBI)&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer with a molecular locker enables the formation of a locked superstructure equipped with emergent structure&#8211;function relationships. Experiments that exploit variable&#8208;temperature ground&#8208;state electronic absorption spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrate that the excitonic coupling between nearest neighboring units in the tethered superstructure is preserved at a temperature (371&#8197;K) where the pristine, non&#8208;covalent assembly exists exclusively in a molecularly dissolved state. A close examination of the solid&#8208;state morphologies reveals that the locked superstructure engenders the formation of hierarchical 1D materials which are not achievable by unlocked assemblies. To complement these structural attributes, we further demonstrate that covalently tethering a supramolecular polymer built from PBI subunits enables the emergence of electronic properties not evidenced in non&#8208;covalent assemblies. Using cyclic voltammetry experiments, the elucidation of the potentiometric properties of the locked superstructure reveals a 100&#8208;mV stabilization of the conduction band energy when compared to that recorded for the non&#8208;covalent assembly.

      <title>Molecular, Macromolecular, and Supramolecular Glucuronide Prodrugs: Lead Identified for Anticancer Prodrug Monotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Targeting tumors: Safe, tumor&#8208;accumulating prodrugs that are specific to the enzymatic repertoire of the tumor comprise an effective anticancer therapy. The lead structure could not be predicted by in vitro/ex vivo screens but was identified through in vivo monitoring.







Abstract
In this work, a tumor growth intervention by localized drug synthesis within the tumor volume, using the enzymatic repertoire of the tumor itself, is presented. Towards the overall success, molecular, macromolecular, and supramolecular glucuronide prodrugs were designed for a highly potent toxin, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The lead candidate exhibited a fold difference in toxicity between the prodrug and the drug of 175, had an engineered mechanism to enhance the deliverable payload to tumours, and contained a highly potent toxin such that bioconversion of only a few prodrug molecules created a concentration of MMAE sufficient enough for efficient suppression of tumor growth. Each of these points is highly significant and together afford a safe, selective anticancer measure, making tumor&#8208;targeted glucuronides attractive for translational medicine.

      <dc:description>
LED down the gradient path: Miniaturized autonomous swimmers follow chemical and magnetic field gradients with simultaneous light emission based on the integration of two redox reactions into a light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Miniaturized autonomous chemo&#8208;electronic swimmers, based on the coupling of spontaneous oxidation and reduction reactions at the two poles of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), are presented as chemotactic and magnetotactic devices. In homogeneous aqueous media, random motion caused by a bubble&#8208;induced propulsion mechanism is observed. However, in an inhomogeneous environment, the self&#8208;propelled devices exhibit positive chemotactic behavior, propelling themselves along a pH or ionic strength gradient (&#8711;pH and &#8711;I, respectively) in order to reach a thermodynamically higher active state. In addition, the intrinsic permanent magnetic moment of the LED allows self&#8208;orientation in the terrestrial magnetic field or following other external magnetic perturbations, which enables a directional motion control coupled with light emission. The interplay between chemotaxis and magnetotaxis allows fine&#8208;tuning of the dynamic behavior of these swimmers.

      <title>Crystals in Minutes: Instant On&#8208;Site Microcrystallisation of Various Flavours of the CYP102A1 (P450BM3) Haem Domain</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal Rain: Using microcrystals of CYP102A1 (P450BM3) bound to the crystallisation accelerator N&#8208;abietoyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan (AbiATrp) as nuclei in batch microseeding, a range of novel structures of the P450BM3 haem domain could be determined. These structures could be useful in the structure&#8208;based design of P450BM3 as a potent biocatalyst.







Abstract
Despite CYP102A1 (P450BM3) representing one of the most extensively researched metalloenzymes, crystallisation of its haem domain upon modification can be a challenge. Crystal structures are indispensable for the efficient structure&#8208;based design of P450BM3 as a biocatalyst. The abietane diterpenoid derivative N&#8208;abietoyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan (AbiATrp) is an outstanding crystallisation accelerator for the wild&#8208;type P450BM3 haem domain, with visible crystals forming within 2&#8197;hours and diffracting to a near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;. Using these crystals as seeds in a cross&#8208;microseeding approach, an assortment of P450BM3 haem domain crystal structures, containing previously uncrystallisable decoy molecules and diverse artificial metalloporphyrins binding various ligand molecules, as well as heavily tagged haem&#8208;domain variants, could be determined. Some of the structures reported herein could be used as models of different stages of the P450BM3 catalytic cycle.

Abstract
SuFEx reactions, in which an S&#8722;F moiety reacts with a silyl&#8208;protected phenol, have been developed as powerful click reactions.

      <title>Deciphering Iron&#8208;Dependent Activity in Oxygen Evolution Catalyzed by Nickel&#8211;Iron Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron versus nickel: Turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyzed by a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been determined. Effects of structural disorder of NiOOH lattice are revealed.







Abstract
Nickel iron oxyhydroxide is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Whereas the presence of Fe ions is essential to the high activity, the functions of Fe are currently under debate. Using oxygen isotope labeling and operando Raman spectroscopic experiments, we obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites for a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are structurally defined samples of the corresponding oxyhydroxides. The Fe sites have TOFs 20&#8211;200 times higher than the Ni sites such that at an Fe content of 4.7&#8201;% and above the Fe sites dominate the catalysis. Higher Fe contents lead to larger structural disorder of the NiOOH host. A volcano&#8208;type correlation was found between the TOFs of Fe sites and the structural disorder of NiOOH. Our work elucidates the origin of the Fe&#8208;dependent activity of NiFe LDH, and suggests structural ordering as a strategy to improve OER catalysts.

      <title>Assembly of the Thiolated [Au1Ag22(S&#8208;Adm)12]3+ Superatom Complex into a Framework Material through Direct Linkage by SbF6&#8722; Anions</title>
      <dc:description>
A fresh framework: A new type of porous material, termed a SCIF (superatom complex inorganic framework), was constructed by linking Au1Ag22 superatom clusters with inorganic SbF6&#8722; (see picture). The obtained SCIF&#8208;1 and SCIF&#8208;2 materials exhibited unique fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence properties.







Abstract
Building framework materials with desirable properties and enhanced functionalities with nanocluster/superatom complexes as building blocks remains a challenge in the field of nanomaterials. In this study, the chiral [Au1Ag22(S&#8208;Adm)12]3+ nanocluster/superatom complex (SC, in which S&#8208;Adm=1&#8208;adamantanethiol) was employed as a building block to construct the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) superatom complex inorganic framework (SCIF) materials SCIF&#8208;1 and SCIF&#8208;2 through inorganic SbF6&#8722; linkers. SCIF&#8208;1 is racemic due to the assembly of two SC enantiomers in a single crystal. In SCIF&#8208;2, the SC enantiomers are packed in separate crystals, thus producing larger channels and a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. These two 3D SCIF materials exhibit unique sensitive photoluminescence (PL) in protic solvents. Our study provides a new pathway for creating novel open&#8208;framework materials with superatom complexes and a foundation for the further development of 3D framework materials for sensing and other applications.

      <title>Programmed Locomotion of an Active Gel Driven by Spiral Waves</title>
      <dc:description>
Run and turn! With alternation between darkness and illumination, transition between nearly linear (&#8220;run&#8221;) and steering (&#8220;turn&#8221;) locomotion can be realized. Such composite locomotion is often found in biological activities like larval taxis.







Abstract
Active media that host spiral waves can display complex modes of locomotion driven by the dynamics of those waves. We use a model of a photosensitive stimulus&#8208;responsive gel that supports the propagation of spiral chemical waves to study locomotive transition and programmed locomotion. The mode transition between circular and toroidal locomotion results from the onset of spiral tip meandering that arises via a secondary Hopf bifurcation as the level of illumination is increased. This dynamic instability of the system introduces a second circular locomotion with a small diameter caused by tip meandering. The original circular locomotion with large diameter is driven by the push&#8208;pull asymmetry of the wavefront and waveback of the simple spiral waves initiated at one corner of gel. By harnessing this mode transition of the gel locomotion via coded illumination, we design programmable pathways of nature&#8208;inspired angular locomotion of the gel.

      <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective Acylation of Biaryl Phenols via Sequential Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Atropselective acylation of symmetric biaryl diols using isothiourea catalysis leads to chiral biaryls with high enantioselectivity. This process consists of two successive enantioselective reactions with an initial desymmetrization coupled with a chiroablative kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Axially chiral phenols are attractive targets in organic synthesis. This motif is central to many natural products and widely used as precursors to, or directly, as chiral ligands and catalysts. Despite their utility few simple catalytic methods are available for their synthesis in high enantiopurity. Herein the atropselective acylation of a range of symmetric biaryl diols is investigated using isothiourea catalysis. Studies on a model biaryl diol substrate shows that the high product er observed in the process is a result of two successive enantioselective reactions consisting of an initial enantioselective desymmetrization coupled with a second chiroablative kinetic resolution. Extension of this process to a range of substrates, including a challenging tetraorthosubstituted biaryl diol, led to highly enantioenriched products (14 examples, up to 98:2 er), with either HyperBTM or BTM identified as the optimal catalyst depending upon the substitution pattern within the substrate. Computation has been used to understand the factors that lead to high enantiocontrol in this process, with maintenance of planarity to maximize a 1,5&#8208;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction within the key acyl ammonium intermediate identified as the major feature that determines atropselective acylation and thus product enantioselectivity.

Studies on a model biaryl diol substrate shows that the high product er observed in the process is a result of two successive enantioselective reactions consisting of an initial enantioselective desymmetrization coupled with a second chiroablative kinetic resolution. Extension of this process to a range of substrates, including a challenging tetraorthosubstituted biaryl diol, led to highly enantioenriched products (14 examples, up to 98:2 er), with either HyperBTM or BTM identified as the optimal catalyst depending upon the substitution pattern within the substrate. Computation has been used to understand the factors that lead to high enantiocontrol in this process, with maintenance of planarity to maximize a 1,5&#8208;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction within the key acyl ammonium intermediate identified as the major feature that determines atropselective acylation and thus product enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Repurposing antiviral drugs for orthogonal RNA&#8208;catalyzed labeling of RNA</title>
      <dc:description>In vitro  selected ribozymes are promising tools for site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA. Previously known nucleic acid catalysts attached fluorescently labeled adenosine or guanosine derivatives via 2',5'&#8208;branched phosphodiester bonds to the RNA of interest. Here we report new ribozymes that use orthogonal substrates, derived from the antiviral drug tenofovir, and attach bioorthogonal functional groups, as well as affinity handles and fluorescent reporter units via a hydrolytically more stable phosphonate ester linkage. The tenofovir transferase ribozymes were identified by  in vitro  selection and are orthogonal to nucleotide transferase ribozymes. As genetically encodable functional RNAs, these ribozymes may be developed for potential cellular applications. Here, the orthogonal ribozymes addressed desired target sites in large RNAs  in vitro  , as shown by fluorescent labeling of  E.coli  16S and 23S rRNAs in total cellular RNA.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantiocomplementary Epoxidation Reactions Catalyzed by&#160;an Engineered Cofactor&#8208;Independent Non&#8208;Natural Peroxygenase</title>
      <dc:description>Peroxygenases are heme&#8208;dependent enzymes that use peroxide&#8208;borne oxygen to catalyze a wide range of oxyfunctionalization reactions. Herein, we report the engineering of an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent peroxygenase based on a promiscuous tautomerase that accepts different hydroperoxides (t&#8208;BuOOH and H2O2) to accomplish enantiocomplementary epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes (citral and substituted cinnamaldehydes), providing access to both enantiomers of the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes.&#160;High conversions (up to 98%), high enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee), and good product yields (50&#8208;80%) were achieved. The reactions likely proceed via a reactive enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediate, allowing tweaking of the enzyme&#8217;s activity and selectivity by protein engineering. Our results underscore the potential of catalytic promiscuity for the engineering of new cofactor&#8208;independent oxidative enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Cyclobutyl Ketones Using a Chiral Transient Directing Group</title>
      <dc:description>The utilization of chiral transient directing groups (TDGs) has recently emerged as a promising approach for developing Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H activation reactions. However, this strategy is particularly challenging because the stereogenic center present on the TDG is often far from the C&#8211;H bond. Additionally, the TDG covalently attached to the substrate and the free TDG are both capable of coordinating to Pd(II) centers, which can result in a mixture of reactive complexes that may lead to opposite asymmetric induction. To date, the single example of TDG&#8208;enabled enantioselective C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H activation is limited to the functionalization of benzylic C&#8211;H bonds. Herein we report the first example of a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H arylation reaction of aliphatic ketones using a chiral transient directing group. A chiral trisubstituted cyclobutane is efficiently synthesized from a monosubstituted cyclobutane via sequential C&#8211;H arylation reactions, demonstrating the ability of this method to access structurally complex products from simple starting materials. The use of an electron&#8208;deficient pyridone ligand is also crucial for the observed high enantioselectivity. Interestingly, employing different silver salts can reverse the enantioselectivity in the C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H arylation reaction. These key mechanistic findings will provide insight for future development of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H activation reactions with chiral TDGs.</dc:description>

To date, the single example of TDG&#8208;enabled enantioselective C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H activation is limited to the functionalization of benzylic C&#8211;H bonds. Herein we report the first example of a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H arylation reaction of aliphatic ketones using a chiral transient directing group. A chiral trisubstituted cyclobutane is efficiently synthesized from a monosubstituted cyclobutane via sequential C&#8211;H arylation reactions, demonstrating the ability of this method to access structurally complex products from simple starting materials. The use of an electron&#8208;deficient pyridone ligand is also crucial for the observed high enantioselectivity. Interestingly, employing different silver salts can reverse the enantioselectivity in the C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H arylation reaction. These key mechanistic findings will provide insight for future development of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H activation reactions with chiral TDGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>In Vitro Selection of A DNA Aptamer&#160;Targeting Degraded Protein Fragments for Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>Protein biomarkers often exist as degradation fragments in biological samples, and affinity agents derived using a purified protein may not recognize them, limited their value for clinical diagnosis. Herein we present a method to overcome this issue, by selecting aptamers against a degraded form of the toxin B protein, which is a marker for diagnosing toxigenic  Clostridium difficile  infections. This approach has led to isolation of a DNA aptamer that recognizes degraded toxin B, fresh toxin B, and toxin B spiked into human stool samples. DNA aptamers selected using intact recombinant toxin B failed to recognize degraded toxin B, which is the form present in stored stool samples. Using this new aptamer, we produced a simple paper&#8208;based analytical device for colorimetric detection of toxin B in stool samples, or in the NAP1 strain of  Clostridium difficile  .

      <title>An Activatable AIEgen Probe for High&#8208;Fidelity Monitoring of Overexpressed Tumor Enzyme Activity and Its Application to Surgical Tumor Excision</title>
      <dc:description>
The cutting edge: An enzyme&#8208;activated two&#8208;photon AIEgen, DQM&#8208;ALP, for imaging the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in tumor cells and 3D tumor spheroids with high spatial resolution was synthesized. DQM&#8208;ALP enabled accurate differentiation between tumor and normal tissue ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo, suggesting that the probe may serve as a powerful tool to assist surgeons during tumor resection.







Abstract
Monitoring fluctuations in enzyme overexpression facilitates early tumor detection and excision. An AIEgen probe (DQM&#8208;ALP) for the imaging of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was synthesized. The probe consists of a quinoline&#8208;malononitrile (QM) core decorated with hydrophilic phosphate groups as ALP&#8208;recognition units. The rapid liberation of DQM&#8208;OH aggregates in the presence of ALP resulted in aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence. The up&#8208;regulation of ALP expression in tumor cells was imaged using DQM&#8208;ALP. The probe permeated into 3D cervical and liver tumor spheroids for imaging spatially heterogeneous ALP activity with high spatial resolution on a two&#8208;photon microscopy platform, providing the fluorescence&#8208;guided recognition of sub&#8208;millimeter tumorigenesis. DQM&#8208;ALP enabled differentiation between tumor and normal tissue ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo, suggesting that the probe may serve as a powerful tool to assist surgeons during tumor resection.

      <title>Capturing the Monomeric (L)CuH in NHC&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrin: Cavity&#8208;Controlled Chemoselective Hydrosilylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>
The law of cavity: Cavity&#8208;controlled chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones was observed inside NHC&#8208;capped cyclodextrins (ICyDs). The cavity features an elusive intermediate monomeric (L)CuH moiety.







Abstract
The encapsulation of copper inside a cyclodextrin capped with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (ICyD) allowed both to catch the elusive monomeric (L)CuH and a cavity&#8208;controlled chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Remarkably, (&#945;&#8208;ICyD)CuCl promoted the 1,2&#8208;addition exclusively, while (&#946;&#8208;ICyD)CuCl produced the fully reduced product. The chemoselectivity is controlled by the size of the cavity and weak interactions between the substrate and internal C&#8722;H bonds of the cyclodextrin.

The right handedness: Chiral FexCuySe nanoparticles (NPs) that absorb in the range of 400&#8211;1000&#8197;nm have been prepared. The findings reveal that d&#8208;FexCuySe NPs have a high efficiency for protection against the neuronal damage induced by the deposition of A&#946;42 and alleviated the symptoms in mice with Alzheimer's disease to recover their cognitive competence.







Abstract
The accumulation and deposition of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) plaques in the brain is considered a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chiral l/d&#8208;FexCuySe nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated that interfer with the self&#8208;assembly of A&#946;42 monomers and trigger the A&#946;42 fibrils in dense structures to become looser monomers under 808&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. d&#8208;FexCuySe NPs have a much higher affinity for A&#946;42 fibrils than l&#8208;FexCuySe NPs and chiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs. The chiral FexCuySe NPs also generate more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than chiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs under NIR&#8208;light irradiation. In living MN9D cells, d&#8208;NPs attenuate the adhesion of A&#946;42 to membranes and neuron loss after NIR treatment within 10&#8197;min without the photothermal effect. In&#8208;vivo experiments showed that d&#8208;FexCuySe NPs provide an efficient protection against neuronal damage induced by the deposition of A&#946;42 and alleviate symptoms in a mouse model of AD, leading to the recovery of cognitive competence.

Upon triggering by the tumor microenvironment, FEAD1 can specifically light&#8208;up metastatic tumor nodules with high sensitivity accompanied by burst drug release into deep tumor tissue.







Abstract
Activatable theranostic systems show potential for improved tumor diagnosis and therapy owing to high detection specificities, effective ablation, and minimal side&#8208;effects. Herein, a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostic system (FEAD1) for precise diagnosis and treatment of peritoneal metastases is presented. FEAD1 was fabricated by self&#8208;assembling the peptide Fmoc&#8208;His, mercaptopropionic&#8208;functionalized Ag2S quantum dots (MPA&#8208;Ag2S QDs), the chemodrug doxorubicin (DOX), and NIR absorber A1094 into nanoparticles. We show that in healthy tissue, FEAD1 exists in an NIR&#8208;II fluorescence &#8220;off&#8221; state, because of Ag2S QDs&#8208;A1094 interactions, while DOX remains in stealth mode. Upon delivery of FEAD1 to the tumor, the acidic TME triggers its disassembly through breakage of the Fmoc&#8208;His metal coordination and DOX hydrophobic interactions. Release of A1094 switches on Ag2S fluorescence, illuminating the tumor, accompanied by burst release of DOX within the tumor tissue, thereby achieving precise tumor theranostics. This TME&#8208;activated theranostic strategy holds great promise for future clinical applications.

      <title>Electrooxidation Enables Selective Dehydrogenative [4+2] Annulation between Indole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy for electrochemical [4+2] annulation of different indoles, to afford highly functionalized pyrimido[5,4&#8208;b]indoles, is presented. This method displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance and can be extended to pharmaceutical research. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction proceeds by radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling between an indole radical cation and an N&#8208;centered radical.







Abstract
Dearomative annulation of indoles has emerged as a powerful tool for the preparation of polycyclic indoline&#8208;based alkaloids. Compared with well&#8208;established methods towards five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused indolines, the six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused indolines are rarely accessed under thermal conditions. Herein, a dearomative [4+2] annulation between different indoles is developed through an electrochemical pathway. This transformation offers a remarkably regio&#8208; and stereoselective route to highly functionalized pyrimido[5,4&#8208;b]indoles under oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, this electrochemical approach maintains excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance and can be extended as a modification tactic for pharmaceutical research. Preliminary mechanism studies indicate that the electrooxidation annulation proceeds through radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling between an indole radical cation and an N&#8208;centered radical generated in&#8197;situ.

      <title>Autocatalytic Carbonyl Arylation through In Situ Release of Aryl Nucleophiles from N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;Silyldiazenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Under cover of nitrogen: Silyl&#8208;protected aryl&#8208;substituted diazenes act as masked aryl nucleophiles. Upon initiation with Me3SiOM (M=Li, Na, and K), aryl transfer to carbonyl and carboxyl groups occurs at ambient temperature. This mild nucleophile generation is compatible with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating functional groups.







Abstract
A method for the catalytic generation of functionalized aryl alkali metals is reported. These highly reactive intermediates are liberated from silyl&#8208;protected aryl&#8208;substituted diazenes by the action of Lewis basic alkali metal silanolates, resulting in desilylation and loss of N2. Catalytic quantities of these Lewis bases initiate the transfer of the aryl nucleophile from the diazene to carbonyl and carboxyl compounds with superb functional&#8208;group tolerance. The aryl alkali metal can be decorated with electrophilic substituents such as methoxycarbonyl or cyano as well as halogen groups. The synthesis of a previously unknown cyclophane&#8208;like [4]arene macrocycle from a 1,3&#8208;bisdiazene combined with a 1,4&#8208;dialdehyde underlines the potential of the approach.

Abstract
The understanding of catalyst deactivation represents one of the major challenges for the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon (MTH) reaction over acidic zeolites. Here we report the critical role of intermolecular &#960;&#8208;interactions in catalyst deactivation in the MTH reaction on zeolites H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 and H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. &#960;&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced spatial proximities between cyclopentenyl cations and aromatics in the confined channels and/or cages of zeolites are revealed by two&#8208;dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The formation of naphtalene as a precursor to coke species is favored due to the reaction of aromatics with the nearby cyclopentenyl cations and correlates with both acid density and zeolite topology.

      <title>Total Synthesis of a Mycolic Acid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
      <dc:description>
The total synthesis of four methoxy mycolic acid diastereomers is described. Key steps involve a Suzuki&#8211;Fu cross&#8208;coupling, an anti&#8208;selective Abiko&#8211;Masamune asymmetric aldol reaction, and an enantioselective Charette cyclopropanation. CD1b&#8208;free mycolic acid tetramer staining experiments clearly favoured one diastereomer over the other three.







Abstract
In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycolic acids and their glycerol, glucose, and trehalose esters (&#8220;cord factor&#8221;) form the main part of the mycomembrane. Despite their first isolation almost a century ago, full stereochemical evaluation is lacking, as is a scalable synthesis required for accurate immunological, including vaccination, studies. Herein, we report an efficient, convergent, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of four stereo&#8208;isomers of a mycolic acid and its glucose ester. Binding to the antigen presenting protein CD1b and T cell activation studies are used to confirm the antigenicity of the synthetic material. The absolute stereochemistry of the syn&#8208;methoxy methyl moiety in natural material is evaluated by comparing its optical rotation with that of synthetic material.

      <title>Ligand Effects on the Electronic Structure of Heteroleptic Antimony&#8208;Centered Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical Tuning: Three unprecedented heteroleptic stibanyl radicals were synthesized and their electronic structures elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The boryl&#8208;substituted radical undergoes one&#8208;electron reduction to give the corresponding stibanyl anion, which was shown to possess partial Sb&#8722;B double&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
We report on the structures of three unprecedented heteroleptic Sb&#8208;centered radicals [L(Cl)Ga](R)Sb. (2&#8208;R, R=B[N(Dip)CH]2 2&#8208;B, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3 2&#8208;C, N(SiMe3)Dip 2&#8208;N) stabilized by one electropositive metal fragment [L(Cl)Ga] (L=HC[C(Me)N(Dip)]2, Dip=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) and one bulky B&#8208; (2&#8208;B), C&#8208; (2&#8208;C), or N&#8208;based (2&#8208;N) substituent. Compounds 2&#8208;R are predominantly metal&#8208;centered radicals. Their electronic properties are largely influenced by the electronic nature of the ligands R, and significant delocalization of unpaired&#8208;spin density onto the ligands was observed in 2&#8208;B and 2&#8208;N. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies showed that 2&#8208;B undergoes a quasi&#8208;reversible one&#8208;electron reduction, which was confirmed by the synthesis of [K([2.2.2]crypt)][L(Cl)GaSbB[N(Dip)CH]2] ([K([2.2.2]crypt)][2&#8208;B]) containing the stibanyl anion [2&#8208;B]&#8722;, which was shown to possess significant Sb&#8722;B multiple&#8208;bonding character.

The boryl&#8208;substituted radical undergoes one&#8208;electron reduction to give the corresponding stibanyl anion, which was shown to possess partial Sb&#8722;B double&#8208;bond character.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the structures of three unprecedented heteroleptic Sb&#8208;centered radicals [L(Cl)Ga](R)Sb&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;R&lt;/b&gt;, R=B[N(Dip)CH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;B&lt;/b&gt;, 2,6&#8208;Mes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;C&lt;/b&gt;, N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Dip &lt;b&gt;2&#8208;N&lt;/b&gt;) stabilized by one electropositive metal fragment [L(Cl)Ga] (L=HC[C(Me)N(Dip)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dip=2,6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and one bulky B&#8208; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;B&lt;/b&gt;), C&#8208; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;C&lt;/b&gt;), or N&#8208;based (&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;N&lt;/b&gt;) substituent. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&#8208;R&lt;/b&gt; are predominantly metal&#8208;centered radicals. Their electronic properties are largely influenced by the electronic nature of the ligands R, and significant delocalization of unpaired&#8208;spin density onto the ligands was observed in &lt;b&gt;2&#8208;B&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&#8208;N&lt;/b&gt;. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies showed that &lt;b&gt;2&#8208;B&lt;/b&gt; undergoes a quasi&#8208;reversible one&#8208;electron reduction, which was confirmed by the synthesis of [K([2.2.2]crypt)][L(Cl)GaSbB[N(Dip)CH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] ([K([2.2.2]crypt)][&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;B&lt;/b&gt;]) containing the stibanyl anion [&lt;b&gt;2&#8208;B&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which was shown to possess significant Sb&#8722;B multiple&#8208;bonding character.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discrete Hf18 metal&#8208;oxo cluster&#160;as a heterogeneous&#160; nanozyme for site&#8208;specific proteolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Effective heterogeneous catalysts for the controlled transformation of large and complex biomolecules are rare and challenging to develop. In particular, selective hydrolysis of proteins by non&#8208;enzymatic catalysis is difficult to achieve, yet it is crucial for many modern applications in biotechnology and proteomics. Herein we report that discrete hafnium metal&#8208;oxo cluster (Hf  18  O  10  (OH)  26  (SO  4  )  13  (H  2  O)  33  ) (  Hf  18  ), which is centred by the same hexamer motif found in many MOFs, acts as a heterogeneous catalyst for the efficient hydrolysis of horse heart myoglobin (HHM) protein in low buffer concentrations. Remarkably, among 154 amino acids present in the sequence of HHM, strictly selective cleavage at only 6 solvent accessible aspartate residues, Asp5, Asp21, Asp45, Asp110, Asp123 and Asp142 was observed. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the hydrolytic activity is likely derived from the synergistic actuation of Hf  4+  Lewis acidic sites and the Br&#248;nsted acidic surface of  Hf  18  . A combination of X&#8208;ray scattering and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that  Hf  18  is completely insoluble in these conditions, confirming the HHM hydrolysis is caused by a heterogeneous reaction of solid  Hf  18  cluster, and not from smaller, soluble Hf species that could leach in solution. This study highlights the great potential of discrete metal&#8208;oxo cluster materials as inorganic proteases.</dc:description>

      <title>Principles of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: Design of Deactivation Pathways for Advanced AIEgens and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Twenty years ago, the concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) was proposed, and this unique luminescent property has attracted scientific interest ever since. However, AIE denominates only the phenomenon, while the details of its underlying guiding principles remain to be elucidated. This mini review discusses the basic principles of AIE based on our previous mechanistic study on the photophysical behavior of 9,10&#8208;bis( N  , N  &#8208;dialkylamino)anthracene ( BDAA  ) and the corresponding mechanistic analysis by quantum chemical calculations. BDAA  comprises of an anthracene core and small electron donors, which allows discussing the quantum&#8208;chemical aspects of AIE. The key factor for AIE is the control over the non&#8208;radiative decay (deactivation) pathway, which can be visualized by considering the conical intersection (CI) on a potential energy surface. Controlling the conical intersection (CI) on the potential energy surface enables the separate formation of fluorescent (CI:high) and non&#8208;fluorescent (CI:low) molecules. The novelty and originality of AIE in the field of photochemistry lies in the creation of functionality by design and in the active control over deactivation pathways. Moreover, we provide a new design strategy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) and discuss selected examples.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the hybridization of local exciton and charge&#8208;transfer states in highly efficient organic photovoltaic cells</title>
      <dc:description>Decreasing the energy loss is one of the most feasible ways to improve the efficiencies of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Recent studies have suggested that non&#8208;radiative energy loss is the dominant factor that hinders further improvements in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPV cells. However, there is no rational molecular design strategy for OPV materials with suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss. In this work, taking molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a quantitative parameter, we establish a general relationship between chemical structure and intermolecular interactions. The results reveal that increasing the ESP difference between donor and acceptor will enhance the intermolecular interaction. In the OPV cells, the enhanced intermolecular interaction will increase the charge transfer state ratio in its hybridization with local exciton to facilitate the charge generation but simultaneously result in a larger non&#8208;radiative energy loss. These results suggest that finely tuning the ESP of OPV materials is a feasible method to further improve the efficiencies of OPV cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Extending Carrier Lifetimes in Lead Halide Perovskites with Alkali Metals by Passivating and Eliminating Halide Interstitial Defects</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkalis passivate iodine interstitial defects in lead perovskites, eliminate the mid&#8208;gap states, and suppress the nonradiative recombination. Theoretical guidelines are developed for defect inactivation in perovskite solar cells and other devices.







Abstract
Defects, such as halide interstitials, act as charge recombination centers, induce degradation of halide perovskites, and create major obstacles to applications of these materials. Alkali metal dopants greatly improve perovskite performance. Using ab&#8197;initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, it is demonstrated that alkalis bring favorable effects. The formation energy of halide interstitials increases by up to a factor of four in the presence of alkali dopants, and therefore, defect concentration decreases. When defects are present, alkali metals strongly bind to them. Halide interstitials introduce mid&#8208;gap states that rapidly trap charge carriers. Alkalis eliminate the trap states, helping to maintain high current density. Further to charge trapping, the interstitials accelerate charge recombination. By passivating the interstitials, alkalis make carrier lifetimes up to seven times longer than in defect&#8208;free perovskites and up to thirty times longer than in defective perovskites.

      <title>Homogeneous, Low&#8208;volume, Efficient, and Sensitive Quantitation of Circulating Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 for Cancer Diagnosis and Immunotherapy Response Prediction</title>
      <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;induced thermophoresis quantitation of exosomal programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1, a transmembrane protein) was developed, which integrates effective recognition of aptamer and homogeneous thermophoresis. The facile technique is more sensitive and efficient than the current enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;based methods. Translation of the method into standard clinical practice for immunotherapy prediction and monitoring is anticipated.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but its efficacy is severely hindered by the lack of effective predictors. Herein, we developed a homogeneous, low&#8208;volume, efficient, and sensitive exosomal programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1, a type of transmembrane protein) quantitation method for cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy response prediction (HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1). The method combines a newly evolved aptamer that efficiently binds to PD&#8208;L1 with less hindrance by antigen glycosylation than antibody, and homogeneous thermophoresis with a rapid binding kinetic. As a result, HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 is higher in sensitivity, more rapid in reaction time, and easier to operate than existing enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;based methods. As a consequence of an outstanding improvement of sensitivity, the level of circulating exosomal PD&#8208;L1 detected by HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 can effectively distinguish cancer patients from healthy volunteers, and for the first time was found to correlate positively with the metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Overall, HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 brings a fresh approach to exosomal PD&#8208;L1 quantitation, offering unprecedented potential for early cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy response prediction.

      <title>In Situ Reconstruction of a Hierarchical Sn&#8208;Cu/SnOx Core/Shell Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A Sn/SnOx interface reconstructed in&#8197;situ facilitates formic acid production by optimizing the binding of the reaction intermediate HCOO* while promotes Faradaic efficiency of C1 products by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. This results in high Faradaic efficiency, current density, and stability of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to give C1 (formate and CO) products is one of the most techno&#8208;economically achievable strategies for alleviating CO2 emissions. Now, it is demonstrated that the SnOx shell in Sn2.7Cu catalyst with a hierarchical Sn&#8208;Cu core can be reconstructed in&#8197;situ under cathodic potentials of CO2RR. The resulting Sn2.7Cu catalyst achieves a high current density of 406.7&#177;14.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with C1 Faradaic efficiency of 98.0&#177;0.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.70&#8197;V vs. RHE, and remains stable at 243.1&#177;19.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a C1 Faradaic efficiency of 99.0&#177;0.5&#8201;% for 40&#8197;h at &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. RHE. DFT calculations indicate that the reconstructed Sn/SnOx interface facilitates formic acid production by optimizing binding of the reaction intermediate HCOO* while promotes Faradaic efficiency of C1 products by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in high Faradaic efficiency, current density, and stability of CO2RR at low overpotentials.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Organic Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Circularly polarized organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) of small molecules is realized by direct bonding of achiral carbazole to a chiral ester chain for efficient chirality transfer and molecular packing arrangement upon photo&#8208;activation. The photo&#8208;activated CP&#8208;OURTP can be facilely deactivated by thermal treatment for stimuli&#8208;responsive reversible CP&#8208;OURTP with high photo/thermal stabilities.







Abstract
Purely organic materials showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and ultralong RTP (OURTP) have recently attracted much attention. However, it is challenging to integrate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) into RTP/OURTP. Here, we show a strategy to realize CPL&#8208;active OURTP (CP&#8208;OURTP) by binding an achiral phosphor group directly to the chiral center of an ester chain. Engineering of this flexible chiral chain enables efficient chirality transfer to carbazole aggregates, resulting in strong CP&#8208;OURTP with a lifetime of over 0.6&#8197;s and dissymmetry factor of 2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 after the conformation regulation upon photo&#8208;activation. The realized CP&#8208;OURTP is thus stable at room temperature but can be deactivated quickly at 50&#8201;&#176;C to CP&#8208;RTP with high CPL stability during the photo&#8208;activation/thermal&#8208;deactivation cycles. Based on this extraordinary photo/thermal&#8208;responsive and highly reversible CP&#8208;OURTP/RTP, a CPL&#8208;featured lifetime&#8208;encrypted combinational logic device has been successfully established.

Based on this extraordinary photo/thermal&#8208;responsive and highly reversible CP&#8208;OURTP/RTP, a CPL&#8208;featured lifetime&#8208;encrypted combinational logic device has been successfully established.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Affecting an Ultra&#8208;High Work Function of Silver</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high increase in the work function (WF) of silver, from 4.26 to 7.42&#8197;eV, by 3D dual&#8208;entrapment of the WF modifying components l&#8208;cysteine and Zn(OH)2 within the metal is reported. The WF enhancement mechanism is based on directly affecting the charge transfer ability of the metal, separately by cysteine and hydrolyzed zinc(II), and synergistically by the combination of the two, through the known Zn&#8208;cysteine finger redox trap effect.







Abstract
An ultra&#8208;high increase in the WF of silver, from 4.26 to 7.42&#8197;eV, that is, an increase of up to circa 3.1&#8197;eV is reported. This is the highest WF increase on record for metals and is supported by recent computational studies which predict the potential ability to affect an increase of the WF of metals by more than 4&#8197;eV. We achieved the ultra&#8208;high increase by a new approach: Rather than using the common method of 2D adsorption of polar molecules layers on the metal surface, WF modifying components, l&#8208;cysteine and Zn(OH)2, were incorporated within the metal, resulting in a 3D architecture. Detailed material characterization by a large array of analytical methods was carried out, the combination of which points to a WF enhancement mechanism which is based on directly affecting the charge transfer ability of the metal separately by cysteine and hydrolyzed zinc(II), and synergistically by the combination of the two through the known Zn&#8208;cysteine finger redox trap effect.

      <title>Optimal Geometrical Configuration of Cobalt Cations in Spinel Oxides to Promote Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
MgCo2O4, CoCr2O4, and Co2TiO4 were selected, where only Co3+ in the center of octahedron (Oh), Co2+ in the center of tetrahedron (Td), and Co2+ in the center of Oh can be active sites as model electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.

Abstract
MgCo2O4, CoCr2O4, and Co2TiO4 were selected, where only Co3+ in the center of octahedron (Oh), Co2+ in the center of tetrahedron (Td), and Co2+ in the center of Oh, can be active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co3+(Oh) sites are the best geometrical configuration for OER. Co2+(Oh) sites exhibit better activity than Co2+(Td). Calculations demonstrate the conversion of O* into OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step for Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td). For Co2+(Oh), it is thermodynamically favorable for the formation of OOH* but difficult for the desorption of O2. Co3+(Oh) needs to increase the lowest Gibbs free energy over Co2+(Oh) and Co2+(Td), which contributes to the best activity. The coexistence of Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td) in Co3O4 can promote the formation of OOH* and decrease the free&#8208;energy barrier. This work screens out the optimal geometrical configuration of cobalt cations for OER and gives a valuable principle to design efficient electrocatalysts.

      <title>Photoacoustic Imaging Quantifies Drug Release from Nanocarriers via Redox Chemistry of Dye&#8208;Labeled Cargo</title>
      <dc:description>
A covalently linked paclitaxel&#8211;methylene blue conjugate (PTX&#8208;MB) is used for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release from nanocarriers via photoacoustic imaging. The PTX&#8208;MB remained in acoustically silent form when encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. After release, PTX&#8208;MB instantly oxidized to the photoacoustically active form to report quantity and biodistribution.







Abstract
We report a new approach to monitor drug release from nanocarriers via a paclitaxel&#8211;methylene blue conjugate (PTX&#8208;MB) with redox activity. This construct is in a photoacoustically silent reduced state inside poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (PTX&#8208;MB@PLGA NPs). During release, PTX&#8208;MB is spontaneously oxidized to produce a concentration&#8208;dependent photoacoustic signal. An in vitro drug&#8208;release study showed an initial burst release (25&#8201;%) between 0&#8211;24&#8197;h and a sustained release between 24&#8211;120&#8197;h with a cumulative release of 40.6&#8201;% and a 670&#8208;fold increase in photoacoustic signal. An in vivo murine drug release showed a photoacoustic signal enhancement of up to 649&#8201;% after 10&#8197;hours. PTX&#8208;MB@PLGA NPs showed an IC50 of 78&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and 44.7&#177;4.8&#8201;% decrease of tumor burden in an orthotopic model of colon cancer via luciferase&#8208;positive CT26 cells.

      <title>Branching Regulation in Olefin Polymerization via Lewis Acid Triggered Isomerization of Monomers</title>
      <dc:description>
Branch manager: Addition of AlCl3 to a Pd&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking polymerization results in rapid isomerization of 1&#8208;alkenes to internal alkenes which polymerize with high branching. Block copolymers can be prepared by adding AlCl3 midway through the reaction.







Abstract
We present a new strategy to regulate branching in chain&#8208;walking olefin polymerization by triggering a rapid isomerization of 1&#8208;alkene monomers into internal olefins by adding a Lewis acid. Polymerization of internal alkenes proceeds via chain&#8208;walking to give polymers with much higher branching than 1&#8208;alkene analogues. The utility of this approach is exemplified by synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with distinct branching characteristics per block by addition of Lewis acid midway through a reaction. We propose a novel mechanism whereby Lewis acid undergoes a counterion swap with the complex which favors isomerization as well as forming adducts with ancillary ligands, freeing coordination sites for internal alkene coordination polymerization.

      <title>Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry Within Cellulose Nanocrystal Gel Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixing cellulose nanocrystal suspensions (CNC&#8208;Na+) with the polyionic macrocycle cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) yields gels with embedded active hosts. These materials reversibly absorb and recognize guests from solution to produce colorful host&#8211;guest complexes. This behavior has enabled CNC&#8208;CBPQT4+ gels to function as substrates for chromatography and encryption.







Abstract
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) spontaneously assemble into gels when mixed with a polyionic organic or inorganic salt. Here, we have used this ion&#8208;induced gelation strategy to create functional CNC gels with a rigid tetracationic macrocycle, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+). Addition of [CBPQT]Cl4 to CNCs causes gelation and embeds an active host inside the material. The fabricated CNC gels can reversibly absorb guest molecules from solution then undergo molecular recognition processes that create colorful host&#8211;guest complexes. These materials have been implemented in gel chromatography (for guest exchange and separation), and as elements to encode 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional patterns. We anticipate that this concept might be extended to design a set of responsive and selective gel&#8208;like materials functioning as, for instance, water&#8208;pollutant scavengers, substrates for chiral separations, or molecular flasks.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mixing cellulose nanocrystal suspensions&lt;/b&gt; (CNC&#8208;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) with the polyionic macrocycle cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene) (&lt;b&gt;CBPQT&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;) yields gels with embedded active hosts. These materials reversibly absorb and recognize guests from solution to produce colorful host&#8211;guest complexes. This behavior has enabled CNC&#8208;&lt;b&gt;CBPQT&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; gels to function as substrates for chromatography and encryption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) spontaneously assemble into gels when mixed with a polyionic organic or inorganic salt. Here, we have used this ion&#8208;induced gelation strategy to create functional CNC gels with a rigid tetracationic macrocycle, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene) (&lt;b&gt;CBPQT&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;). Addition of [&lt;b&gt;CBPQT&lt;/b&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to CNCs causes gelation and embeds an active host inside the material. The fabricated CNC gels can reversibly absorb guest molecules from solution then undergo molecular recognition processes that create colorful host&#8211;guest complexes. These materials have been implemented in gel chromatography (for guest exchange and separation), and as elements to encode 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional patterns. We anticipate that this concept might be extended to design a set of responsive and selective gel&#8208;like materials functioning as, for instance, water&#8208;pollutant scavengers, substrates for chiral separations, or molecular flasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stable Polymer Nanoparticles with Exceptionally High Drug Loading by Sequential Nanoprecipitation</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple nanoprecipitation approach is used to produce drug&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles with exceptionally high drug loading (up to 58.5&#8201;%) from a wide range of polymers and drugs. This technology is based on tuning the precipitation time of drugs and polymers using a mixed&#8208;solvent system.







Abstract
Poor solubility often leads to low drug efficacy. Encapsulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in polymeric nanoparticles offers a solution. However, low drug loading remains a critical challenge. Now, a simple and robust sequential nanoprecipitation technology is used to produce stable drug&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles with high drug loading (up to 58.5&#8201;%) from a wide range of polymers and drugs. This technology is based on tuning the precipitation time of drugs and polymers using a solvent system comprising multiple organic solvents, which allows the formation of drug nanoparticles first followed by immediate precipitation of one or two polymers. This technology offers a new strategy to manufacture polymeric nanoparticles with high drug loading having good long&#8208;term stability and programmed release and opens a unique opportunity for drug delivery applications.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Radical Polymerisation by Living Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacteria are able to synthesise complex macromolecules from a variety of natural building blocks. It is now shown that they can also be utilized to produce entirely abiotic polymers from readily available synthetic precursors.







Abstract
The ability to harness cellular redox processes for abiotic synthesis might allow the preparation of engineered hybrid living systems. Towards this goal we describe a new bacteria&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalysed reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP), with a range of metal&#8208;chelating agents and monomers that can be used under ambient conditions with a bacterial redox initiation step to generate polymers. Cupriavidus metallidurans, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium sporogenes species were chosen for their redox enzyme systems and evaluated for their ability to induce polymer formation. Parameters including cell and catalyst concentration, initiator species, and monomer type were investigated. Water&#8208;soluble synthetic polymers were produced in the presence of the bacteria with full preservation of cell viability. This method provides a means by which bacterial redox systems can be exploited to generate &#8220;unnatural&#8221; polymers in the presence of &#8220;host&#8221; cells, thus setting up the possibility of making natural&#8211;synthetic hybrid structures and conjugates.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Metal Ion Precursors for the Synthesis of Nanocomposites for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Benefits of instability: MOFs are used as metal ion precursors for the synthesis of nanocomposites by exploiting the instability of MOFs. The reaction occurs simply by mixing the MOFs, substrates, and other reactants (such as TAA and nickel nitrate). Through a heterogeneous growth process, nanomaterials with uniform structures can be formed on different substrates.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials with fascinating properties. Their widespread applications are sometimes hindered by the intrinsic instability of frameworks. However, this instability of MOFs can also be exploited for useful purposes. Herein, we report the use of MOFs as metal ion precursors for constructing functional nanocomposites by utilizing the instability of MOFs. The heterogeneous growth process of nanostructures on substrates involves the release of metal ions, nucleation on substrates, and formation of a covering structure. Specifically, the synthesized CoS with carbon nanotubes as substrates display enhanced performance in a lithium&#8208;ion battery. Such strategy not only presents a new way for exploiting the instability of MOFs but also supplies a prospect for designing versatile functional nanocomposites.

      <title>Low&#8208;Fouling Fluoropolymers for Bioconjugation and In&#8197;Vivo Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluoropolymers that are water&#8208;soluble and low&#8208;fouling and have a high fluorine content demonstrate outstanding 19F magnetic resonance imaging sensitivity. They were used as self&#8208;trackable polymers for bioconjugation and in&#8197;vivo tracking.







Abstract
The conjugation of hydrophilic low&#8208;fouling polymers to therapeutic molecules and particles is an effective approach to improving their aqueous stability, solubility, and pharmacokinetics. Recent concerns over the immunogenicity of poly(ethylene glycol) has highlighted the importance of identifying alternative low fouling polymers. Now, a new class of synthetic water&#8208;soluble homo&#8208;fluoropolymers are reported with a sulfoxide side&#8208;chain structure. The incorporation of fluorine enables direct imaging of the homopolymer by 19F MRI, negating the need for additional synthetic steps to attach an imaging moiety. These self&#8208;reporting fluoropolymers show outstanding imaging sensitivity and remarkable hydrophilicity, and as such are a new class of low&#8208;fouling polymer for bioconjugation and in&#8197;vivo tracking.

      <title>Polyhydrazide&#8208;Based Organic Nanotubes as Efficient and Selective Artificial Iodide Channels</title>
      <dc:description>
The right channels: A novel class of foldamer&#8208;based pore&#8208;forming helically folded polyhydrazides, having hydrophobic cavities of about a 6.5&#8197;&#197; diameter, promote transport of anions, rather than cations, across membranes, with iodide as the preferred transport species.

Abstract
Reported herein is a series of pore&#8208;containing polymeric nanotubes based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrazide backbone. Nanotubes of suitable lengths, possessing a hollow cavity of about a 6.5&#8197;&#197; diameter, mediate highly efficient transport of diverse types of anions, rather than cations, across lipid membranes. The reported polymer channel, having an average molecular weight of 18.2&#8197;kDa and 3.6&#8197;nm in helical height, exhibits the highest anion&#8208;transport activities for iodide (EC50=0.042&#8197;&#956;m or 0.028&#8197;mol&#8201;% relative to lipid), whcih is transported 10 times more efficiently than chlorides (EC50=0.47&#8197;&#956;m). Notably, even in cholesterol&#8208;rich environment, iodide transport activity remains high with an EC50 of 0.37&#8197;&#956;m. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that the channel is highly selective for anions and that such anion selectivity arises from a positive electrostatic potential of the central lumen rendered by the interior&#8208;pointing methyl groups.

Nanotubes of suitable lengths, possessing a hollow cavity of about a 6.5&#8197;&#197; diameter, mediate highly efficient transport of diverse types of anions, rather than cations, across lipid membranes. The reported polymer channel, having an average molecular weight of 18.2&#8197;kDa and 3.6&#8197;nm in helical height, exhibits the highest anion&#8208;transport activities for iodide (&lt;i&gt;EC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=0.042&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; or 0.028&#8197;mol&#8201;% relative to lipid), whcih is transported 10 times more efficiently than chlorides (&lt;i&gt;EC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=0.47&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;). Notably, even in cholesterol&#8208;rich environment, iodide transport activity remains high with an &lt;i&gt;EC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.37&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that the channel is highly selective for anions and that such anion selectivity arises from a positive electrostatic potential of the central lumen rendered by the interior&#8208;pointing methyl groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A General Strategy to Enhance Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecules Using Solvent&#8208;Excluding Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>
On the bright side: The photophysical behavior of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecules can be improved through installation of a polar, solvent&#8208;shielding auxiliary to an amino&#8208;donating group. This &#946;&#8208;carbonyl substituent generally enhances the fluorescence quantum yield of D&#8208;A fluorophores, enabling brighter labeling probes for live&#8208;cell imaging.







Abstract
While organic donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecules are widely employed in multiple areas, the application of more D&#8208;A molecules could be limited because of an inherent polarity sensitivity that inhibits photochemical processes. Presented here is a facile chemical modification to attenuate solvent&#8208;dependent mechanisms of excited&#8208;state quenching through addition of a &#946;&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;based polar substituent. The results reveal a mechanism wherein the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl substituent creates a structural buffer between the donor and the surrounding solvent. Through computational and experimental analyses, it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl simultaneously attenuates two distinct solvent&#8208;dependent quenching mechanisms. Using the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl substituent, improvements in the photophysical properties of commonly used D&#8208;A fluorophores and their enhanced performance in biological imaging are shown.

      <title>Rational Development of Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization of Biphenyl: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
Remote control: A nitrile&#8208;directed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of biphenyl derivatives was realized by using 2&#8208;pyridone as a ligand. DFT calculations revealed that a new ligand&#8208;containing Pd&#8211;Ag dimeric transition state is responsible for the meta&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
A simple and efficient nitrile&#8208;directed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H olefination, acetoxylation, and iodination of biaryl compounds is reported. Compared to the previous approach of installing a complex U&#8208;shaped template to achieve a molecular U&#8208;turn and assemble the large&#8208;sized cyclophane transition state for the remote C&#8722;H activation, a synthetically useful phenyl nitrile functional group could also direct remote meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation. This reaction provides a useful method for the modification of biaryl compounds because the nitrile group can be readily converted to amines, acids, amides, or other heterocycles. Notably, the remote meta&#8208;selectivity of biphenylnitriles could not be expected from previous results with a macrocyclophane nitrile template. DFT computational studies show that a ligand&#8208;containing Pd&#8211;Ag heterodimeric transition state (TS) favors the desired remote meta&#8208;selectivity. Control experiments demonstrate the directing effect of the nitrile group and exclude the possibility of non&#8208;directed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation. Substituted 2&#8208;pyridone ligands were found to be key in assisting the cleavage of the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond in the concerted metalation&#8211;deprotonation (CMD) process.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Soft Actuators with Switchable Thermal Reprogrammability</title>
      <dc:description>
The old switcheroo: Soft actuators with switchable thermal reprogrammability have been developed. By flexibly switching on/off network dynamics, easy reprogramming and excellent actuation stability can be achieved, as well as efficient recycling and seamless integration of different motions in a very common siloxane liquid crystalline elastomer.







Abstract
Thermal reprogrammability is essential for new&#8208;generation large dry soft actuators, but the realization sacrifices the favored actuation performance. The contradiction between thermal reprogrammability and stability hampers efforts to design high&#8208;performance soft actuators to be robust and thermally adaptable. Now, a strategy has been developed that relies on repeatedly switching on/off thermal reprogrammability in liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomer (LCE) actuators to resolve this problem. By post&#8208;synthesis swelling, a latent siloxane exchange reaction can be induced in the common siloxane LCEs (switching on), enabling reprogramming into on&#8208;demand 3D&#8208;shaped actuators; by switching off the dynamic network by heating, actuation stability is guaranteed even at high temperature (180&#8201;&#176;C). Using partially black&#8208;ink&#8208;patterned LCEs, selectively switching off reprogrammability allows integration of completely different actuation modes in one monolithic actuator for more delicate and elaborate tasks.

      <title>Deconstructive Reorganization: De Novo Synthesis of Hydroxylated Benzofuran</title>
      <dc:description>
Deconstructive arene cycloisomerization is reported as unprecedented strategy for the de novo synthesis of hydroxylated benzofuran, using kojic acid&#8208; or maltol&#8208;derived alkynes as precursors. Several types of free hydroxyl groups are introduced into the benezofurans with different substitution patterns. A collective total synthesis of hydroxylated benzofuran&#8208;containing natural products (11 examples) is realized.







Abstract
An unprecedented deconstructive reorganization strategy for the de novo synthesis of hydroxylated benzofurans from kojic acid&#8208; or maltol&#8208;derived alkynes is reported. In this reaction, both the benzene and furan rings were simultaneously constructed, whereas the pyrone moiety of the kojic acid or maltol was deconstructed and then reorganized into the benzene ring as a six&#8208;carbon component. Through this strategy, at least one free hydroxyl group was introduced into the benzene ring in a substitution&#8208;pattern tunable fashion without protection&#8211;deprotection and redox adjustment. With this method, a large number of hydroxylated benzofuran derivatives with different substitution&#8208;patterns have been prepared efficiently. This methodology has also been shown as the key step in a collective total synthesis of hydroxylated benzofuran&#8208;containing natural products (11 examples).

      <title>A Flexible Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Battery with Excellent Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability</title>
      <dc:description>
Powering the frozen world: The first flexible zinc&#8211;air battery with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability was achieved through the development of an innovative air&#8208;cathodic electrocatalyst and hydrogel electrolyte. The battery delivers a capacity of 691&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 798&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, along with excellent flexibility and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;temperature performance.







Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZAB) are a promising battery candidate for emerging flexible electronic devices, but the catalysis&#8208;based working principle and unique semi&#8208;opened structure pose a severe challenge to their overall performance at cold temperature. Herein, we report the first flexible rechargeable ZAB with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability, based on the innovation of an efficient electrocatalyst to offset the electrochemical performance shrinkage caused by decreased temperature and a highly conductive hydrogel with a polarized terminal group to render the anti&#8208;freezing property. The fabricated ZABs show excellent electrochemical performances that outperform those of many aqueous ZABs at room temperature. They also deliver a high capacity of 691&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 798&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C (92.7&#8201;% and 87.2&#8201;% retention of the room temperature counterparts, respectively), together with excellent flexibility and reverting capability.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition A Flexible Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Battery with Excellent Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Powering the frozen world&lt;/b&gt;: The first flexible zinc&#8211;air battery with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability was achieved through the development of an innovative air&#8208;cathodic electrocatalyst and hydrogel electrolyte. The battery delivers a capacity of 691&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an energy density of 798&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, along with excellent flexibility and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;temperature performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZAB) are a promising battery candidate for emerging flexible electronic devices, but the catalysis&#8208;based working principle and unique semi&#8208;opened structure pose a severe challenge to their overall performance at cold temperature. Herein, we report the first flexible rechargeable ZAB with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability, based on the innovation of an efficient electrocatalyst to offset the electrochemical performance shrinkage caused by decreased temperature and a highly conductive hydrogel with a polarized terminal group to render the anti&#8208;freezing property. The fabricated ZABs show excellent electrochemical performances that outperform those of many aqueous ZABs at room temperature. They also deliver a high capacity of 691&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an energy density of 798&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C (92.7&#8201;% and 87.2&#8201;% retention of the room temperature counterparts, respectively), together with excellent flexibility and reverting capability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intrinsically Low Thermal Conductivity and High Carrier Mobility in Dual Topological Quantum Material, n&#8208;Type BiTe</title>
      <dc:description>
Highs and lows: Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) and high carrier mobility (&#956;) occurs in BiTe, which is facilitated by its unique dual topological quantum phases. It is a weak topological insulator (WTI) as a result of its layered hetero&#8208;structure, and thus it exhibits low thermal conductivity; but simultaneously BiTe is also a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) and thus it has high carrier mobility.







Abstract
A challenge in thermoelectrics is to achieve intrinsically low thermal conductivity in crystalline solids while maintaining a high carrier mobility (&#956;). Topological quantum materials, such as the topological insulator (TI) or topological crystalline insulator (TCI) can exhibit high &#956;. Weak topological insulators (WTI) are of interest because of their layered hetero&#8208;structural nature which has a low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat). BiTe, a unique member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series (m:n=1:2), has both the quantum states, TCI and WTI, which is distinct from the conventional strong TI, Bi2Te3 (where m:n=0:1). Herein, we report intrinsically low &#954;lat of 0.47&#8211;0.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the 300&#8211;650&#8197;K range in BiTe resulting from low energy optical phonon branches which originate primarily from the localized vibrations of Bi bilayer. It has high &#956;&#8776;516&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 707&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 along parallel and perpendicular to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) directions, respectively, at room temperature.

      <title>Guanine&#8208;Stabilized Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Guanine perovskites: Stabilization of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase (FA=formamidinium) is realized by using guaninium (G) based G2PbI4 low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, forming heterostructures that lead to improved performances and stabilities of the corresponding solar cells. The structural properties are investigated to unravel the mode of action and set the path for using this approach in perovskite solar cell research.







Abstract
Formamidinium (FA) lead iodide perovskite materials feature promising photovoltaic performances and superior thermal stabilities. However, conversion of the perovskite &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase to the thermodynamically stable yet photovoltaically inactive &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase compromises the photovoltaic performance. A strategy is presented to address this challenge by using low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite materials comprising guaninium (G) organic spacer layers that act as stabilizers of the three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase. The underlying mode of interaction at the atomic level is unraveled by means of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and DFT calculations. Low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;phase&#8208;containing hybrid FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells are obtained with improved performance and enhanced long&#8208;term stability.

      <title>A Coordinative Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Efficiency in Cytosolic Protein and Peptide Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Stand and deliver: A coordinative dendrimer was rationally designed for cytosolic protein delivery. The synthesized polymer shows unprecedented efficiency in the cytosolic delivery of proteins and peptides with different isoelectric points. The bioactivities of the proteins are maintained after intracellular release.







Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery is a prerequisite for the development of protein therapeutics that act on intracellular targets. Proteins are generally membrane&#8208;impermeable and thus need a carrier such as a polymer to facilitate their internalization. However, the efficient binding of proteins with different isoelectric points to polymeric carriers is challenging. In this study, we designed a coordinative dendrimer to solve this problem. The dendrimers modified with dipicolylamine/zinc(II) complex were capable of binding proteins through a combination of ionic and coordination interactions. The best polymer efficiently delivered 30 cargo proteins and peptides into the cytosol, while maintaining their bioactivity after intracellular release. The removal or replacement of zinc ions in the polymer with other transition&#8208;metal ions lead to significantly decreased efficiency in cytosolic protein delivery. This study provides a new strategy to develop robust and efficient polymers for cytosolic protein delivery.

      <dc:description>
A coordinative dendrimer delivers 30 types of cargo proteins and peptides into the cytosol of living cells, while maintaining their bioactivity after intracellular release. In their Research Article on page&#8197;4711, Y. Cheng et al. report that dendrimers modified with a dipicolylamine/zinc(II) complex are capable of binding proteins through a combination of ionic and coordination interactions. This provides a new strategy to develop robust and efficient polymers for cytosolic protein delivery.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A coordinative dendrimer&lt;/b&gt; delivers 30 types of cargo proteins and peptides into the cytosol of living cells, while maintaining their bioactivity after intracellular release. In their Research Article on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201914970page&#8197;4711&lt;/a&gt;, Y. Cheng et al. report that dendrimers modified with a dipicolylamine/zinc(II) complex are capable of binding proteins through a combination of ionic and coordination interactions. This provides a new strategy to develop robust and efficient polymers for cytosolic protein delivery.

Biomimetic strain&#8208;stiffening supramolecular hydrogels were prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of molecular gelators, as shown by J.&#8197;H. van&#8197;Esch and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;4830. Orthogonal self&#8208;assembly of the molecular gelators and lipids led to hydrogel networks embedded with liposomes being formed that also showed strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, thus resembling both the structures and mechanical responsiveness of biological tissue.

      <dc:description>
Photoacoustic imaging enables a new strategy to monitor drug delivery, as reported by J.&#8197;V. Jokerst and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;4678. Here, the paclitaxel drug is tagged with redox&#8208;active methylene blue. This drug&#8211;dye conjugate was sealed inside a poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanocarrier in the reduced state where it does not absorb light. When the drug&#8211;dye conjugate is released, the dye is oxidized to report the location and quantity of the cargo.

      <title>Switching in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
A switch in time: Although dynamic and flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been closely assessed in recent literature, analysis into the subcategory of switchable MOFs has been comparably lacking. By virtue of their steady rise in popularity, MOFs with intriguing, switchable responses to light, temperature, pressure, redox species and guests are surveyed.







Abstract
In recent years, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have become an area of intense research interest because of their adjustable pores and nearly limitless structural diversity deriving from the design of different organic linkers and metal structural building units (SBUs). Among the recent great challenges for scientists include switchable MOFs and their corresponding applications. Switchable MOFs are a type of smart material that undergo distinct, reversible, chemical changes in their structure upon exposure to external stimuli, yielding interesting technological applicability. Although the process of switching shares similarities with flexibility, very limited studies have been devoted specifically to switching, while a fairly large amount of research and a number of Reviews have covered flexibility in MOFs. This Review focuses on the properties and general design of switchable MOFs. The switching activity has been delineated based on the cause of the switching: light, spin crossover (SCO), redox, temperature, and wettability.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Based Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Despite the rapid developments in the past decade, many great challenges remain for the practical use of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based electrocatalysts. This Minireview summaries some major recent research efforts and advances on MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Some promising directions and strategies are also discussed.







Abstract
In view of the clean and sustainable energy, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials, including pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and their derivatives are emerging as unique electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the clean and sustainable energy, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials, including pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and their derivatives are emerging as unique electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thanks to their tunable compositions and diverse structures, efficient MOF&#8208;based materials provide new opportunities to accelerate the sluggish ORR at the cathode in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. This Minireview first provides some introduction of ORR and MOFs, followed by the classification of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts towards ORR.

      <title>Emerging Bottom&#8208;Up Strategies for the Synthesis of Graphene Nanoribbons and Related Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
To prepare high&#8208;quality, defect&#8208;free graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), cycloaromatization reactions need to be very efficient, proceed without side reaction and mild enough to accommodate various functional groups. In this Minireview, the latest approaches for the synthesis of GNRs and related structures, including alkyne benzannulation, photochemical cyclodehydrohalogenation, Mallory and Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed reactions are presented.







Abstract
The solution&#8208;phase synthesis is one of the most promising strategies for the preparation of well&#8208;defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in large scale. To prepare high quality, defect&#8208;free GNRs, cycloaromatization reactions need to be very efficient, proceed without side reaction and mild enough to accommodate the presence of various functional groups. In this Minireview, we present the latest synthetic approaches for the synthesis of GNRs and related structures, including alkyne benzannulation, photochemical cyclodehydrohalogenation, Mallory and Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

      <title>Enantioselective Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions of Indanonecarboxamides with Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Crossing over: A highly efficient asymmetric radical&#8208;polar crossover reaction of indanonecarboxamides/esters and various electron&#8208;rich alkenes was realized by combining a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/NiII complex catalyst with Ag2O. Five types of products could be obtained with good to excellent yields and ee values.







Abstract
Highly efficient asymmetric intermolecular radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were realized by combining a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/NiII complex catalyst with Ag2O under mild reaction conditions. Various terminal alkenes and indanonecarboxamides/esters underwent radical addition/cyclization reactions to afford spiro&#8208;iminolactones and spirolactones with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, a range of different radical&#8208;mediated oxidation/elimination or epoxide ring&#8208;opening products were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The Lewis acid catalysts exhibited excellent performance and precluded the strong background reaction.

      <title>Ribosomal Incorporation of Aromatic Oligoamides as Peptide Sidechain Appendages</title>
      <dc:description>
The ribosome tolerates aromatic oligoamide foldamer&#8211;peptide hybrids not only when the foldamer belongs to the initiation unit, but also when it is appended as a sidechain within the peptide or at the C&#8208;terminus of the peptide. This expands the range of substrates known to be accepted by the ribosome to include significantly larger and more structurally defined substrates.







Abstract
Derivatives of 4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine with aromatic oligoamide foldamers as sidechain appendages were successfully charged on tRNA by means of flexizymes. Their subsequent incorporation both at the C&#8208;terminus of, and within, peptide sequences by the ribosome, was demonstrated. These results expand the registry of chemical structures tolerated by the ribosome to sidechains significantly larger and more structurally defined than previously demonstrated.

      <dc:description>
An activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted oxidative cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the assembly of biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids was developed for the synthesis of arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.







Abstract
Biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides comprise an intriguing class of structurally diverse natural products with significant biological activity. Especially noteworthy are the antibiotics arylomycin and its synthetic analogue G0775, which exhibits potent activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Herein, we present a simple, flexible, and reliable strategy based on activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted catalytic oxidative coupling for assembling biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids. The synthetic approach was utilized for preparing a number of natural and unnatural biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides, including arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.

      <dc:description>
Enantioselective construction of axially chiral compounds by the electrophilic carbothiolation of alkynes is disclosed. This transformation is enabled by the use of a tosyl&#8208;protected bifunctional sulfide catalyst and mesyl&#8208;protected ortho&#8208;alkynylaryl amines.

Abstract
The enantioselective construction of axially chiral compounds by electrophilic carbothiolation of alkynes is disclosed for the first time. This enantioselective transformation is enabled by the use of a Ts&#8208;protected bifunctional sulfide catalyst and Ms&#8208;protected ortho&#8208;alkynylaryl amines (Ts=tosyl; Ms=mesyl). Both electrophilic arylthiolating and electrophilic trifluoromethylthiolating reagents are suitable for this reaction. The obtained products of axially chiral vinyl&#8211;aryl amino sulfides can be easily converted into biaryl amino sulfides, biaryl amino sulfoxides, biaryl amines, vinyl&#8211;aryl amines, and other valuable difunctionalized compounds.

      <title>Access to Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Polypropylene through Coordination Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Selective coordination polymerization of allenes was achieved using rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal precursors. The resultant polyallenes can be easily transformed into the poly(allyl alcohol) derivatives through hydroboration/oxidation. The copolymerization of propylene and allene monomers also proceeds to afford unprecedented hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polypropylene after post&#8208;functionalization. DFT simulations suggests kinetic rather than thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Preparation of polyethylenes containing hydroxy groups has been already industrialized through radical copolymerization under harsh conditions followed by alcoholysis. By contrast, hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polypropylene has proven a rather challenging goal in polymer science. Propylene can't be polymerized through a radical mechanism, and its coordination copolymerization with polar monomers is frustrated by catalyst poisoning. Herein, we report a new strategy to reach this target. The coordination polymerization of allenes by rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal precursors affords pure 1,2&#8208;regulated polyallenes, which are facilely transformed into poly(allyl alcohol) analogues by subsequent hydroboration/oxidation. Strikingly, the copolymerization of allenes and propylene gives unprecedented hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polypropylene after post&#8208;polymerization modification. Mechanistic elucidation by DFT simulation suggests kinetic rather than thermodynamic control.

      <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Cationic Boron Complexes Distorted by Pyridine&#8208;based Pincer Ligands: Isolation of a Photochemical Hofmann&#8211;Martius&#8208;type Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron fit to a T: Pincer ligands distort boron cations toward a T&#8208;shaped geometry, enabling new reactivity patterns including a photochemical C&#8722;C formation/C&#8722;N cleavage yielding a Hofmann&#8211;Martius&#8208;type intermediate.







Abstract
A family of cationic boron complexes was synthesized, using a dianilidopyridine pincer ligand, which imposes in&#8208;plane distortion of the geometry at boron towards T&#8208;shaped. Reactivity of these cations toward hydride and base was investigated, and the utility of these cations as precursors to a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated BN heterocycles was demonstrated. 300&#8197;nm irradiation of a deprotonated pincer boron complex triggered a C&#8722;N cleavage/C&#8722;C formation yielding a dearomatized boryl imine, which has a structure akin to the long&#8208;proposed intermediate in the photochemical Hofmann&#8211;Martius rearrangement. The photo&#8208;rearrangement triggers relief of the distortion imposed by the pincer ligand.

      <title>Formation and Fate of Formaldehyde in Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbon Reaction: In Situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Formaldehyde (HCHO) was unambiguously detected and quantified for the first time during methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon catalysis over HSAPO&#8208;34 and HZSM&#8208;5 by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry. The time&#8208;resolved profiles of products show that HCHO is mainly derived from the disproportionation of methanol at acidic sites, HCHO affects the hydrogen&#8208;transfer processes of olefins into aromatics and aromatics into coke, and HCHO controls the contribution of the aromatic&#8208;based cycle.







Abstract
HCHO has been confirmed as an active intermediate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon (MTH) reaction, and is critical for interpreting the mechanisms of coke formation. Here, HCHO was detected and quantified during the MTH process over HSAPO&#8208;34 and HZSM&#8208;5 by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry. Compared with conventional methods, excellent time&#8208;resolved profiles were obtained to study the formation and fate of HCHO, and other products during the induction, steady&#8208;state reaction, and deactivation periods. Similar formation trends of HCHO and methane, and their close correlation in yields suggest that they are derived from disproportionation of methanol at acidic sites. In the presence of Y2O3, the amount of HCHO changes, affecting the hydrogen&#8208;transfer processes of olefins into aromatics and aromatics into cokes. The yield of HCHO affects the aromatic&#8208;based cycle and the formation of ethylene, indicating that ethylene is mainly formed from the aromatic&#8208;based cycle.

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Activation by a Molecular Aluminium Imide: C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage and C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
C&#8722;C coupling: An isolable molecular aluminium imide with a highly polarized Al&#8722;N bond has been found to react with CO via C&#8801;O bond cleavage and C&#8722;C coupling. Key proposed intermediates in this transformation feature an aluminium&#8208;bound isocyanate fragment.







Abstract
Anionic molecular imide complexes of aluminium are accessible via a rational synthetic approach involving the reactions of organo azides with a potassium aluminyl reagent. In the case of K2[(NON)Al(NDipp)]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) structural characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a short Al&#8722;N distance, which is thought primarily to be due to the low coordinate nature of the nitrogen centre. The Al&#8722;N unit is highly polar, and capable of the activation of relatively inert chemical bonds, such as those found in dihydrogen and carbon monoxide. In the case of CO, uptake of two molecules of the substrate leads to C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8801;O bond cleavage. Thermodynamically, this is driven, at least in part, by Al&#8722;O bond formation. Mechanistically, a combination of quantum chemical and experimental observations suggests that the reaction proceeds via exchange of the NR and O substituents through intermediates featuring an aluminium&#8208;bound isocyanate fragment.

Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of unprotected &#948;&#8208;lactams has been realized starting from readily accessible acrylamides and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides an efficient means of synthesizing a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines.







Abstract
We report a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available acrylamide derivatives and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides a rapid route to a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines. The regioselectivity of the reaction with unactivated terminal alkene is significantly improved by using Cpt ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The synthetic utility of the reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of a potential drug candidate containing a trisubstituted piperidine moiety. Mechanistic studies show that the reversibility of the C&#8722;H activation depends on the choice of Cp ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The irreversible C&#8722;H activation is observed and becomes turnover&#8208;limiting with [CptRhCl2]2 as catalyst.

      <title>Molecular Evidence for Metallic Cobalt Boosting CO2 Electroreduction on Pyridinic Nitrogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts are presented for application in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Molecular probes were designed to clarify the genuine catalytically active sites. CO2RR takes place preferentially on pyridinic rather than pyrrolic nitrogen, and metallic cobalt nanoparticles enhance the CO2RR on pyridinic nitrogen significantly.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials (N&#8208;Cmat) are emerging as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), although the activities are still unsatisfactory and the genuine active site is still under debate. We demonstrate that the CO2RR to CO preferentially takes place on pyridinic N rather than pyrrolic N using phthalocyanine (Pc) and porphyrin with well&#8208;defined N&#8208;Cmat configurations as molecular model catalysts. Systematic experiments and theoretic calculations further reveal that the CO2RR performance on pyridinic N can be significantly boosted by electronic modulation from in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated metallic Co nanoparticles. By introducing Co nanoparticles, Co@Pc/C can achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 84&#8201;% and CO current density of 28&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V, which are 18 and 47 times higher than Pc/C without Co, respectively. These findings provide new insights into the CO2RR on N&#8208;Cmat, which may guide the exploration of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction.

      <title>Proton Insertion Chemistry of a Zinc&#8211;Organic Battery</title>
      <dc:description>
Proton insertion chemistry based on organic aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) was developed in a mild electrolyte. The H+ insertion/extraction endows the battery system with enhanced electrochemical performance. Moreover, the proton insertion chemistry will broaden horizons of aqueous ZIBs.







Abstract
Proton storage in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) is attracting extensive attention owing to the fast kinetics of H+ insertion/extraction. However, it has not been achieved in organic materials&#8208;based ZIBs with a mild electrolyte. Now, aqueous ZIBs based on diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) in a mild electrolyte are developed. Electrochemical and structural analysis confirm for the first time that such Zn&#8211;HATN batteries experience a H+ uptake/removal behavior with highly reversible structural evolution of HATN. The H+ uptake/removal endows the Zn&#8211;HATN batteries with enhanced electrochemical performance. Proton insertion chemistry will broaden the horizons of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries and open up new opportunities to construct high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

      <title>Acetylene as a Dicarbene Equivalent for Gold(I) Catalysis: Total Synthesis of Waitziacuminone in One Step</title>
      <dc:description>
Acetylene gas behaves as a dicarbene equivalent in the presence of gold(I). This concept has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of acetylene gas with alkenes leads to (Z,Z)&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;butadienes and biscyclopropanes depending on the donor ligand on gold(I). Acetylene was generated in&#8197;situ from calcium carbide and water in a user&#8208;friendly procedure. Reaction of acetylene with 1,5&#8208;dienes gives rise stereoselectively to tricyclo[5.1.0.02,4]octanes. This novel double cyclopropanation has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [4+2] Cycloadditions of Vinylcarbenes with Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective [4+2] cycloaddition: A mechanistically unusual approach for a highly enantioselective [4+2] cycloaddition between rhodium&#8208;stabilized vinylcarbenes and siloxydienes was developed. The reaction is initiated by attack of the diene at the vinylogous position of the vinylcarbene and the outcome is dependent of the reacting conformation of the vinylcarbene intermediate.







Abstract
The reaction of 2&#8208;siloxycyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with E&#8208;vinyldiazoacetates in the presence of the bulky chiral dirhodium tetracarboxylate catalyst, Rh2(R&#8208;p&#8208;PhTPCP)4 results in an enantioselective [4+2] cycloaddition, in which three new stereogenic centers are formed. The [4+2] cycloadducts are generated as single diastereomers with high enantiocontrol (95&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). When the diene contains an additional stereogenic center, effective kinetic resolution can be achieved.

      <title>Biomimetic Strain&#8208;Stiffening Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogels have been prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of molecular gelators. On the basis of orthogonal self&#8208;assembly of the molecular gelators and lipids, hydrogel networks embedded with liposomes are formed and show strain&#8208;stiffening behavior as well, resembling both the structures and mechanical responsiveness of biological tissue.







Abstract
Supramolecular structures with strain&#8208;stiffening properties are ubiquitous in nature but remain rare in the lab. Herein, we report on strain&#8208;stiffening supramolecular hydrogels that are entirely produced through the self&#8208;assembly of synthetic molecular gelators. The involved gelators self&#8208;assemble into semi&#8208;flexible fibers, which thereby crosslink into hydrogels. Interestingly, these hydrogels are capable of stiffening in response to applied stress, resembling biological intermediate filaments system. Furthermore, strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogel networks embedded with liposomes are constructed through orthogonal self&#8208;assembly of gelators and phospholipids, mimicking biological tissues in both architecture and mechanical properties. This work furthers the development of biomimetic soft materials with mechanical responsiveness and presents potentially enticing applications in diverse fields, such as tissue engineering, artificial life, and strain sensors.

The DNA hybridization occurring at the interface of the SNA and DNA&#8208;coated CNTs leads to an approximately five&#8208;fold improvement in the positioning efficiency in comparison to the positioning of DNA&#8208;coated CNTs directly on the DNA origami.







Abstract
Aligning carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a key challenge for fabricating CNT&#8208;based electronic devices. Herein, we report a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) mediated approach for the highly precise alignment of CNTs at prescribed sites on DNA origami. We find that the cooperative DNA hybridization occurring at the interface of SNA and DNA&#8208;coated CNTs leads to an approximately five&#8208;fold improvement of the positioning efficiency. By combining this with the intrinsic positioning addressability of DNA origami, CNTs can be aligned in parallel with an extremely small angular variation of within 10&#176;. Moreover, we demonstrate that the parallel alignment of CNTs prevents incorrect logic functionality originating from stray conducting paths formed by misaligned CNTs. This SNA&#8208;mediated method thus holds great potential for fabricating scalable CNT arrays for nanoelectronics.

      <title>Precise Size&#8208;Selective Sieving of Nanoparticles Using a Highly Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nm sieving: A flexible supramolecular membrane for the sub&#8208;nanometer sieving of nanoparticles is developed. This membrane comprises a highly oriented, honeycomb&#8208;like, two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer with uniform nanocavities. Owing to this unique structural feature, a precise cutoff size of about 4&#8197;nm has been realized.







Abstract
The development of size&#8208;selective membranes with well&#8208;defined nanopores towards the precise separation of nanometer&#8208;sized substances is a challenging task to achieve. Here a supramolecular membrane is presented that comprises a highly oriented, honeycomb&#8208;like, 2D supramolecular polymer on a polycarbonate filter support. It enables precise size&#8208;selective sieving of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs). Owing to the uniform parallel&#8208;aligned nanocavities within the 2D supramolecular polymers, the composite membrane shows a high size&#8208;selectivity with a sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy in the cutoff size of about 4.0&#8197;nm. In principle, the species of size&#8208;separable particles are unlimited, as demonstrated by quantum dots, noble metal, and metal oxide NPs. This supramolecular membrane combined with filtration advances the potential of NPs in terms of their monochromatic emission and size monodispersity, and also enables rapid removal of small magnetic NP adsorbents that are otherwise difficult to capture.

      <title>Mechanical Force Induces Ylide&#8208;Free Cycloaddition of Nonscissible Aziridines</title>
      <dc:description>
The force awakens: Mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced cycloaddition of intact aziridine groups in a macromolecule with dipolarophiles does not follow the reaction pathways that occur under traditional thermal and photochemical conditions. The aziridines do not undergo cis&#8211;trans isomerization, thus suggesting retention of the ring structure under force. This demonstrates that nonvulnerable chemical structures can be attractive mechanophores.







Abstract
The application of aziridines as nonvulnerable mechanophores is reported. Upon exposure to a mechanical force, stereochemically pure nonactivated aziridines incorporated into the backbone of a macromolecule do not undergo cis&#8211;trans isomerization, thus suggesting retention of the ring structure under force. Nonetheless, aziridines react with a dipolarophile and seem not to obey conventional reaction pathways that involve C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond cleavage prior to the cycloaddition. Our work demonstrates that a nonvulnerable chemical structure can be a mechanophore.

      <title>&#8220;Self&#8208;Lockable&#8221; Liquid Crystalline Diels&#8211;Alder Dynamic Network Actuators with Room Temperature Programmability and Solution Reprocessability</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystalline dynamic networks can be shaped into 3D objects at room temperature while being stabilized by slowly formed Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;bonded (DA) cross&#8208;links. The actuators demonstrate thermally or optically induced reversible shape change for the purpose of performing mechanical work or locomotion.







Abstract
Novel main&#8208;chain liquid crystalline Diels&#8212;Alder dynamic networks (LCDANs) were prepared that exhibit unprecedented ease for actuator programming and reprocessing compared to existing liquid crystalline network (LCN) systems. Following cooling from 125&#8201;&#176;C, LCDANs are deformed with aligned mesogens self&#8208;locked at room temperature by slowly formed Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) bonds, which allows for the formation of solid 3D actuators capable of reversible shape change, and strip walker and wheel&#8208;capable light&#8208;driven locomotion upon either thermally or optically induced order&#8211;disorder phase transition. Any actuator can readily be erased at 125&#8201;&#176;C and reprogrammed into a new one under ambient conditions. Moreover, LCDANs can be processed directly from melt (for example, fiber drawing) and from solution (for example, casting tubular actuators), which cannot be achieved with LCNs using exchangeable covalent bonds. The combined attributes of LCDANs offer significant progress toward developing easily programmable/processable LCN actuators.

      <title>A Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structure for Charge Transport and Active Sites in Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Live LICs: The balance of active sites and charge transport allow Nb2O5 with a hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure to deliver excellent energy density, an ultrahigh power density, and good cycle stability for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs).







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;ion capacitor (LIC) has attracted tremendous research interest because it meets both the requirement on high energy and power densities. The balance between effective surface areas and mass transport is highly desired to fabricate the optimized electrode material for LIC. Now, triple&#8208;shelled (3S) Nb2O5 hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) were synthesized for the first time through the sequential templating approach and then applied for the anode of LIC. The unique structure of HoMSs, such as large efficient surface area, hierarchical pores, and multiple shells, provides abundant reaction sites, decreases the electron transport resistance, and increases the diffusion rate for ion transport. In this case, the best combination performance has been achieved among all the reported Nb2O5&#8208;based materials, which delivered an excellent energy and power densities simultaneously, and superb cycling stability.

      <title>Biomimetic Hydrogenation Catalyzed by a Manganese Model of [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>
The design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is reported. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H4MPT+, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is an efficient biological hydrogenation catalyst. Despite intense research, Fe complexes mimicking the active site of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase have not achieved turnovers in hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we describe the design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H4MPT+, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This activity enables asymmetric relay hydrogenation of benzoxazinones and benzoxazines, involving the hydrogenation of a chiral hydride transfer agent using our catalyst coupled to Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed hydride transfer from this agent to the substrates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is an efficient biological hydrogenation catalyst. Despite intense research, Fe complexes mimicking the active site of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase have not achieved turnovers in hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we describe the design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;MPT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This activity enables asymmetric relay hydrogenation of benzoxazinones and benzoxazines, involving the hydrogenation of a chiral hydride transfer agent using our catalyst coupled to Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed hydride transfer from this agent to the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Production of Hydroxy Acids: Selective Double Oxidation of Diols by Flavoprotein Alcohol Oxidase</title>
      <dc:description>
Triple action: The flavoprotein alcohol oxidase (AOX*) facilitates the double and triple oxidations of diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. Such biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids has potential for the preparation of polyester building blocks.







Abstract
Flavoprotein oxidases can catalyze oxidations of alcohols and amines by merely using molecular oxygen as the oxidant, making this class of enzymes appealing for biocatalysis. The FAD&#8208;containing (FAD=flavin adenine dinucleotide) alcohol oxidase from P. chrysosporium facilitated double and triple oxidations for a range of aliphatic diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. For example, diethylene glycol could be selectively and fully converted into 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethoxy)acetic acid. Such a facile cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids opens up new avenues for the preparation of polyester building blocks.

      <title>Controllable Synthesis of Graphdiyne Nanoribbons</title>
      <dc:description>
Stack a nanoribbon: A facile method for atomically precise graphdiyne nanoribbons has been developed. The method featured inter&#8208; and intramolecular stepwise Glaser&#8211;Hay coupling strategy to reduce random intermolecular polymerization of the ethynyl groups.







Abstract
Graphdiyne nanoribbons with high chemical precision are of great significance for further understanding of the intrinsic properties of graphdiyne and the relationship between structure and properties. However, the reliable synthesis of graphdiyne nanoribbons with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. A facile method is now presented for fabrication of graphdiyne nanoribbons with uniform width through stepwise inter&#8208; and intramolecular Glaser&#8211;Hay coupling reaction of ethynyl groups. The synthetic ribbons were interwoven into nanotextiles by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and were applied for protective coating of Li&#8208;electrode in Li&#8208;ion batteries, which efficiently suppressed the growth of the Li dendrites during cycling and prolonged the life span of Li&#8208;metal batteries.

      <title>Emerging Cubic Chirality in &#947;CD&#8208;MOF for Fabricating Circularly Polarized Luminescent Crystalline Materials and the Size Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest interaction between the chiral void of &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and achiral luminophores with different charges and sizes are presented. Numerous achiral luminophores could be integrated into &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and emitted significantly boosted positive or negative circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). When the size of the guest luminophores was close to the cube size, strong negative CPL was observed.







Abstract
The chiral feature of &#947;CD&#8208;MOF, and especially the emergent cubic void, was not unveiled so far. Now, through the host&#8211;guest interaction between &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and achiral luminophores with different charges and sizes, the unique cubic chirality of the emerging void in &#947;CD&#8208;MOF as well as a size effect on CPL induction are revealed for the first time. Numerous achiral luminophores could be integrated into &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and emitted significantly boosted circularly polarized luminescence. While the small sized luminophores preferred to be loaded into the intrinsic void of &#947;CD, large ones were selectively encapsulated into the cubic void. Interestingly, when the size of the guest luminophores was close to the cube size, it showed strong negative CPL. Otherwise, either positive or negative CPL was induced.

      <dc:description>
A highly regioselective sequential activation of cage B&#8722;I and B&#8722;H bonds in o&#8208;carborane has been achieved in a one&#8208;pot manner. The thermodynamically favorable migration of Pd from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 carbon to cage B(4) serves as a key step in this new process, which represents a new route for regioselective bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carborane with different substituents.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly selective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of 3&#8208;I&#8208;o&#8208;carborane has been developed, leading to the preparation of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;4&#8208;R&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (R=alkyl, alkynyl, aryl, allyl, CN, and amido) in high to excellent yields. This protocol combines the sequential activation of cage B(3)&#8722;I and B(4)&#8722;H bonds by Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to cage B(4), which is driven by thermodynamic force. This represents a brand&#8208;new strategy for selective bifunctionalization of carboranes with two different substituents.

We report a supramolecular strategy for promoting the selective reduction of O2 for direct electrosynthesis of H2O2. We utilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (Co&#8208;TPP), an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst with highly variable product selectivity, as a building block to assemble the permanently porous supramolecular cage Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) bearing six Co&#8208;TPP subunits connected through twenty&#8208;four imine bonds. Reduction of these imine linkers to amines yields the more flexible cage Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6). Both Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) and Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6) cages produce 90&#8211;100&#8201;% H2O2 from electrochemical ORR catalysis in neutral pH water, whereas the Co&#8208;TPP monomer gives a 50&#8201;% mixture of H2O2 and H2O. Bimolecular pathways have been implicated in facilitating H2O formation, therefore, we attribute this high H2O2 selectivity to site isolation of the discrete molecular units in each supramolecule. The ability to control reaction selectivity in supramolecular structures beyond traditional host&#8211;guest interactions offers new opportunities for designing such architectures for a broader range of catalytic applications.

      <title>Li[LiCs2Cl][Ga3S6]: A Nanoporous Framework of GaS4 Tetrahedra with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
The salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenide Li[LiCs2Cl][Ga3S6] is presented, which features a 3D framework composed of [Ga3S6] nanosized tunnels. Introduction of an ionic guest to the covalent chalcogenide host produces a material with a moderate nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficient and an ultrawide band gap (Eg). These characteristics are promising for the development of infrared (IR) NLO materials.







Abstract
A large nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficient and a wide band gap are two crucial but contradictory parameters that are difficult to achieve simultaneously in a single infrared (IR) NLO compound. A salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenide (SIC), Li[LiCs2Cl][Ga3S6] (1), was prepared that presents a nanosized tunnel framework constructed from monotype chalcogenide tetrahedra. Highly oriented covalent GaS4 tetrahedra in the host lead to a moderate second harmonic generation response (0.7&#8201;AgGaS2), and ionic guests effectively broaden the band gap to the widest value (4.18&#8197;eV) among all IR NLO chalcogenides, thereby achieving a remarkable balance between NLO efficiency and band gap.
