      <title>Information Coding in Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
      <dc:description>DNA nanostructures with programmable nanoscale patterns has been achieved in the past decades, and molecular information coding (MIC) on those designed nanostructures has gained increasing attention for information security. However, exerting steganography and cryptography synchronously on DNA nanostructures still remains a challenge to guarantee more security approach for MIC. Here, we demonstrated MIC in a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA), which can reconfigure intrinsic patterns but keep the DODA outline the same for steganography. When a set of keys (DNA strands) are added, the cryptographic data (e.g. Numbers &#8220;0 &#8208; 9&#8221;) can be translated into visible patterns within DODA. More complex cryptography with ASCII nanocodes definition within programmable 6&#215;6 lattice is demonstrated to ensure the versatility of MIC in the DODA. Furthermore, a further  anti&#8208;counterfeiting approach based on conformational transformation mediated toehold strand displacement reaction is designed to protect MIC from decoding and falsification, presenting a unique high&#8208;security level approach for information processing.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystalline Diradical Dianions of Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacenes</title>
      <dc:description>Although diradicals and azaacenes have been greatly attractive in fundamental chemistry and functional materials, the isolable diradical dianions of azaacenes are still unknown. Here we describe the first isolation of azaacene diradical dianion salts [(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)K(THF)  2  ]  +  [(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)K]  +  &#8226;  1  2&#8211;&#8226;&#8226;  and [(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)K(THF)]  2+  &#8226;  2  2&#8211;&#8226;&#8226;  by reduction of the neutral pyrene&#8208;fused azaacene derivatives  1  and  2  with excess potassium graphite in THF in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Their electronic structures were investigated by various experiments, in conjunction with theoretical calculations. It was found that they are open&#8208;shell singlets in the ground state and their triplet states are thermally readily accessible due to the small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This work provides two first examples of crystalline diradical dianions of azaacenes with considerable diradical character.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of NiO Crystals Exposing Stable High&#8208;Index Facets</title>
      <dc:description>Metal oxides exposing high&#8208;index facets are potentially impactful in catalysis and adsorption processes owing to under&#8208;coordinated ions and polarities that alter their interfacial properties compared to low&#8208;index facets. Here, we report molten salt syntheses of NiO particles exposing a variety of crystal facets. We show that for a given anion (nitrate or chloride), the alkali cation has a notable impact on the formation of crystals exposing {311}, {611}, {100} and {111} faces. Based on parametric analysis of synthesis conditions, we posit that the crystallization mechanism is governed by the formation of growth units consisting of Ni(II) complexes whose coordination numbers are determined by temperature and the selection of anion (associated to the coordination sphere) and alkali cation (associated with the outer coordination sphere). Notably, our findings reveal that high&#8208;index facets are particularly favored in chloride media and are stable under prolonged periods of catalysis and steaming. Collectively, these results illustrate the potential of the molten salt method for scalable syntheses of high surface energy metal oxides.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free (5+1) cycloaddition of aryl&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) and hydrosilanes to afford silacyclohexanes is reported. Catalytic amounts of the trityl cation initiate the reaction by hydride abstraction from the hydrosilane, and the further progress of the reaction is maintained by self&#8208;regeneration of the silylium ions.

Various control experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations support a mechanistic picture where a silylium ion intramolecularly stabilized by a cyclopropane ring can either undergo a kinetically favored, concerted [1,2]&#8208;aryl migration/ring expansion or engage in a cyclopropane&#8208;to&#8208;cyclopropane rearrangement.</dc:description>

      <title>Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions between Pt Single Atoms and TiO2</title>
      <dc:description>Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) has gained great attention in heterogeneous catalysis field. However, whether single  &#8208;  atom catalyst can exhibit SMSI remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the SMSI can occur on TiO  2  supported Pt single atoms but at a much higher reduction temperature than that on Pt nanoparticles (NPs). In SMSI state Pt single atoms neither are covered by, nor sink into the subsurface of, TiO  2  support. The suppression of CO adsorption on Pt single atoms stems from the coordination saturation (18 electron role) rather than the physical coverage by support. Based on the new finding it is revealed that in 3&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation reaction single atoms are the real active sites while Pt NPs barely contribute to the activity through selectively encapsulating the NP sites. The finding in this work provides a new approach to study the active sites by tuning the SMSI state.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Nanostructures derived from amphiphilic DNA&#8208;polymer conjugates have emerged prominently due to their rich self&#8208;assembly behavior, however, their synthesis is traditionally challenging. Here, we report a novel platform technology towards DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures of various shapes by leveraging polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) for the polymerization from single stranded DNA (ssDNA). A &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; protocol for thermal reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization from ssDNA under ambient conditions was developed and utilized for the synthesis of functional DNA&#8208;polymer conjugates and DNA&#8208;diblock conjugates derived from acrylates and acrylamides. Using this method, PISA was applied for the first time to manufacture isotropic and anisotropic DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructrures by varying the chain length of the polymer block. The resulting nanostructures were further functionalized by hybridization with a dye&#8208;labelled complementary ssDNA, thus establishing PISA as a powerful route towards intrinsically functional DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures.</dc:description>

      <title>The length of a ubiquitin chain is a general determinant for selective recognition by ubiquitin&#8208;binding proteins</title>
      <dc:description>The attachment of differently linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains of varying length to proteins is a prevalent posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells. The fate of a modified protein is determined by Ub&#8208;binding proteins (UBPs) that interact with Ub chains in a linkage&#8208;selective manner.

      <title>Lewis Acid Coordination Redirects S&#8208;Nitrosothiol Signaling Output</title>
      <dc:description>
S&#8208;Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) serve as air&#8208;stable reservoirs for nitric oxide in biology and are responsible for a myriad of physiological responses. O&#8208;coordination by a Lewis acid both dramatically facilitates RSNO reduction and changes its signaling output from NO to N2O, following protonation of the Lewis acid capped hyponitrite that forms upon reduction.







Abstract
S&#8208;Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) serve as air&#8208;stable reservoirs for nitric oxide in biology. While copper enzymes promote NO release from RSNOs by serving as Lewis acids for intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer, redox&#8208;innocent Lewis acids separate these two functions to reveal the effect of coordination on structure and reactivity. The synthetic Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 coordinates to the RSNO oxygen atom, leading to profound changes in the RSNO electronic structure and reactivity. Although RSNOs possess relatively negative reduction potentials, B(C6F5)3 coordination increases their reduction potential by over 1&#8197;V into the physiologically accessible +0.1&#8197;V vs. NHE. Outer&#8208;sphere chemical reduction gives the Lewis acid stabilized hyponitrite dianion trans&#8208;[LA&#8208;O&#8208;N=N&#8208;O&#8208;LA]2&#8722; [LA=B(C6F5)3], which releases N2O upon acidification. Mechanistic and computational studies support initial reduction to the [RSNO&#8208;B(C6F5)3] radical anion, which is susceptible to N&#8722;N coupling prior to loss of RSSR.

      <title>Engineering Active Sites of Polyaniline for AlCl2+ Storage in Aluminum Battery</title>
      <dc:description>The reversible capacity of AlCl  4  &#8209;  intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation in conventional cathodes of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) is often difficult to be improved due to the large size of AlCl  4  &#8209;  anions. Therefore, it is highly desired to realize the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of other Al&#8208;based ions with smaller size. Here, we fabricated polyaniline/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (PANI/SWCNTs) composite films and further protonated the PANI nanorods in them. The protonation endows PANI with more active sites and enhanced conductivity. More importantly, hyper self&#8208;protonated PANI (PANI(H  +  )) exhibits the reversible AlCl  2  +  intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation during discharge/charge process. As a result, the Al/PANI(H  +  ) battery displays a twice higher discharge capacity in comparison with the original composite films. Furthermore, PANI(H  +  )@SWCNT electrodes also display stable cycling life with only 0.003% capacity decay per cycle over 8000 cycles. In addition, owing to the excellent mechanical properties, PANI(H  +  )@SWCNT composite films can act as the electrodes of flexible AIBs. As a proof of concept, the flexible cable&#8208;type AIBs were assembled based on them and remained stable electrochemical performance at bending states. This work will pave the way for the applications of conducting polymers in AIBs and broadens the horizons of AIBs in flexible energy storage devices.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Structural modulations have been recently found to cause some unusual physical properties, such as superconductivity or charge density wave, however, the thus&#8208;induced nonlinear optical property is rare. We report for the first time two unprecedented incommensurately modulated nonlinear optical sulfides exhibiting phase matching behaviors, A 2  SnS 5  (A = Ba, Sr) with (3+1)D superspace groups  P  2 1  2 1  2(00 &#947;  )00 s  or P  2 1  ( &#945;  0 &#947;  )0, featuring different modulations of the [Sn 2  S 7  ] &#8734;  belts. Remarkably, Ba 2  SnS 5  exhibits an excellent second harmonic generation (SHG) of 1.1 &#215; benchmark AgGaS 2  at 1570 nm and a very large laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of 8 &#215; AgGaS 2  . The theoretical studies uncover the structural modulations increase about 44 or 25% the distortions of the Sn/S building units and enhance significantly the SHG compared with &#945;  &#8208;Ba 2  SnSe 5  without modulation. Besides, despite of having smaller E g  , A 2  SnS 5  exhibit higher LIDTs owing to their smaller thermal expansion anisotropies (Ba 2  SnS 5  (1.51) &lt; Sr 2  SnS 5  (2.08) &lt; AgGaS 2  (2.97)).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural modulations have been recently found to cause some unusual physical properties, such as superconductivity or charge density wave, however, the thus&#8208;induced nonlinear optical property is rare. We report for the first time two unprecedented incommensurately modulated nonlinear optical sulfides exhibiting phase matching behaviors, A 2  SnS 5  (A = Ba, Sr) with (3+1)D superspace groups  P  2 1  2 1  2(00 &#947;  )00 s  or P  2 1  ( &#945;  0 &#947;  )0, featuring different modulations of the [Sn 2  S 7  ] &#8734;  belts. Remarkably, Ba 2  SnS 5  exhibits an excellent second harmonic generation (SHG) of 1.1 &#215; benchmark AgGaS 2  at 1570 nm and a very large laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of 8 &#215; AgGaS 2  . The theoretical studies uncover the structural modulations increase about 44 or 25% the distortions of the Sn/S building units and enhance significantly the SHG compared with &#945;  &#8208;Ba 2  SnSe 5  without modulation. Besides, despite of having smaller E g  , A 2  SnS 5  exhibit higher LIDTs owing to their smaller thermal expansion anisotropies (Ba 2  SnS 5  (1.51) &amp;lt; Sr 2  SnS 5  (2.08) &amp;lt; AgGaS 2  (2.97)).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrizing Protoboration of Vinylsilanes</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric creation of silicon&#8208;stereocenter silanes is a long&#8208;sought but far less developed topic, and only a handful of examples have been reported. Moreover, the construction of (more than) two stereocenters&#8208;containing chiral silanes is a more arduous task and remains unexploited.  We herein  report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrizing protoboration of divinyl substituted silanes with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B  2  pin  2  ). This method allows facile preparation of an array of enantiomerically enriched boronate&#8208;substituted organosilanes bearing contiguous silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereocenters with exclusive regioselectivity and generally excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics at the nanoscale Fe(III)&#8208;OH&#8208;Pt interface</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics is deemed as an environment&#8208;benign strategy to produce industrially important aniline intermediates. Herein, we report that the Pt nanocrystals with Fe(OH) x  deposition, Fe(OH) x  /Pt, enable the selective hydrogenation of nitro group into amino group without hydrogenating other functional groups on aromatic ring. The unique catalytic behavior is identified to be associated with the Fe(III)&#8208;OH&#8208;Pt interfaces. While H 2  activation occurs on exposed Pt atoms to ensure the high activity, the high selectivity towards the production of substituted aniline is originated from the Fe(III)&#8208;OH&#8208;Pt interfaces. In situ  IR, XPS and isotope effect studies reveal that the Fe 3+  /Fe 2+  redox couple facilitates the hydrodeoxygenation of the &#8208;NO 2  group during hydrogenation catalysis.

      <title>Unprecedented kinetic inertness for a Mn2+&#8208;bispidine chelate: a novel structural entry for Mn2+&#8208;based imaging agents</title>
      <dc:description>The search for more biocompatible alternatives to Gd  3+  &#8208;based MRI agents, and the interest in  52  Mn for PET imaging call for ligands that form inert Mn  2+  chelates. Given the labile nature of Mn  2+  , high inertness is challenging to achieve. The strongly preorganized structure of the 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidol ligand L  1  endows its Mn  2+  complex with exceptional kinetic inertness. Indeed, MnL  1  did not show any dissociation for 140 days in the presence of 50 eq. of Zn  2+  (37&#176;C, pH 6), while recently reported potential MRI agents MnPyC3A and MnPC2A&#8208;EA have dissociation half&#8208;lives of 0.285 h and 54.4 h under similar conditions. In addition, the relaxivity of MnL  1  (4.28 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  at 25&#176;C, 20 MHz) is remarkable for a monohydrated, small Mn  2+  chelate.  In vivo  MRI experiments in mice and determination of the tissue Mn content evidence rapid renal clearance of MnL  1  . Additionally, L  1  could be radiolabeled with  52  Mn and the complex revealed good stability in biological media.</dc:description>

      <title>Sandwich&#8208;like catalyst&#8208;carbon&#8208;catalyst trilayer structure as compact 2D host for highly stable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Rational cathode design and compositing are expected to promote the compact Li&#8208;S batteries with the minimization of unloaded and non&#8208;polar volume spaces, which often take a high fraction in loose host framework with the prevailing point contacts between discrete catalyst nanodomains and conductive substrate. Herein, we propose a construction of sandwich structured host full of continuous 2D catalysis&#8208;conduction interfaces. This MoN&#8208;C&#8208;MoN trilayer architecture causes the strong conformal adsorption of S/Li2Sx and their high&#8208;efficiency conversion on the two&#8208;sided nitride polar surfaces, which are supplied with high&#8208;flux electron transfer from the buried carbon interlayer. The 3D self&#8208;assembly of these 2D sandwich structures further reinforces the interconnection of conductive and catalytic networks. The maximized exposure of adsorptive/catalytic planes endows the MoN&#8208;C@S electrode with excellent cycling stability (capacity degradation rate as small as 0.033% per cycle at 1 C over 1000 cycles) and high rate performance (515 mAh/g at 4.0 C) even under high S loading (75.7 wt%) and low host surface area (97 m2/g). The high conductivity of this trilayer texture does not compromise the capacity retention (604 mAh/g after 500 cycles) after increasing the S content to 3.4 mg/cm2. Such a job&#8208;synergistic mode between catalytic and conductive functions guarantees the homogeneous deposition of S/Li2Sx, and avoids their thick and devitalized accumulation (electrode passivation) even after high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling. Our chelation&#8208;ammonification method provides a facile solution to the dispersion of metal&#8208;cations and following attenuation of their nitride products during phase separation between C and MoN nuclei.

      <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Biaryls via C&#8208;H Activation and Intermolecular Coupling with Sterically Hindered Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral biaryls make important synthetic building blocks and privileged ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Reported herein is atroposelective synthesis of biaryl NH isoquinolones via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation of benzamides and intermolecular [4+2] annulation with a broad scope of 2&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalenes as well as sterically hindered symmetric diarylacetylenes. The axial chirality is constructed based on dynamic kinetic transformation of the alkyne in redox&#8208;neutral annulation with benzamides, with alkyne insertion being stereo&#8208;determining. The reaction also accommodates both benzamides and heteroaryl carboxamides and proceeds in excellent regioselectivity (if applicable) and enantioselectivities (average 91.6% ee). An enantiomerically and diastereomerically pure rhodacyclic complex has been prepared and offers insight into enantiomeric control of the coupling system, and the steric interactions between the amide directing group and the alkyne substrate serve to dictate both the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA nanostructures as a tool for targeted antimicrobial delivery</title>
      <dc:description>We report the use of DNA origami nanostructures, functionalized with aptamers, as a vehicle for delivering the antibacterial peptide lysozyme in a specific and efficient manner. We test the system against Gram positive (  Bacillus subtilis  ) and Gram negative (  Escherichia coli  ) targets. We use direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (  d  STORM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the DNA origami nanostructures and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to assess the binding of the origami to the bacteria. We show that treatment with lysozymefunctionalized origami slows bacterial growth more effectively than treatment with free lysozyme. Our study introduces DNA origami as a tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance, and our results demonstrate the specificity and efficiency of the nanostructure as a drug delivery vehicle.</dc:description>
