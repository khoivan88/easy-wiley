      <title>Metal Alkyls with Alkylidynic Metal&#8211;Carbon Bond Character: Key Electronic Structures in Alkane Metathesis Precatalysts.</title>
      <dc:description>The homologation of alkanes via alkane metathesis is catalyzed at low temperatures (150 &#176;C) by the silica&#8208;supported species&#160; (SiO)WMe  5  and&#160;&#160;(SiO)TaMe  4  , while (SiO)TaMe  3  Cp* is inactive. The contrasting reactivity is paralleled by differences in&#160;  13  C NMR signature; the former display significantly more deshielded isotropic chemical shifts (&#948;  iso  ) and almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensors, similar to what is observed in their molecular precursors TaMe  5  and WM  6  . Analysis of the chemical shift tensors reveals the presence of a triple&#8208;bond character in their metal&#8208;carbon (formally single) bond. This electronic structure is reflected in their propensity to generate alkylidynes and to participate in alkane metathesis, further supporting that alkylidynes are key reaction intermediates in that reaction.

      <title>Disentangling Catalytic Processes of Zeolites within Single Oriented Channels</title>
      <dc:description>Establishing structure&#8208;reactivity relationships is vital to developing superior materials for catalysis. It has been well studied in metal&#8208;based catalysts by designing metal nanoparticles with controlled active sites. However, it is rather difficult to achieve for microporous materials as their reactivities are determined by both the type of the active sites and their pores and/or cavities. Herein, a well&#8208;defined model system was developed to build structure&#8208;reactivity relationships for specific zeolite channel orientations during various catalytic reactions, namely methanol&#8208; and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH and ETH) processes as well as oligomerization reactions. The entrapped and effluent hydrocarbons from single oriented zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 channels during the MTH were monitored using  operando  UV&#8208;Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and online mass spectrometry (MS), respectively. The results reveal that the straight channels favor the formation of internal coke, promoting the aromatic cycle. Furthermore, the sinusoidal channels produce aromatics,  e.g.  toluene, that further grow into more condensed polyaromatics,  e.g.,  graphitic coke, leading to the deactivation of the zeolites.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Pyrolaside B:&#160;PhenolTrimerization via Sequenced Oxidative C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A facile method to oxidatively trimerize phenols using a low loading catalytic aerobic copper system is described. The mechanism of this transformation is probed, an understanding of which enabled cross coupling trimerizations. With this method, the natural product pyrolaside B has been synthesized for the first time. The key strategy used for this novel synthesis is the facile one&#8208;step construction of a spiroketal trimer intermediate which can be selectively reduced to give the natural product framework without recourse to stepwise Ullmann&#8208; and Suzuki&#8208;type couplings. As a result, pyrolaside B can be obtained expeditiously in five steps and 16% overall yield. Two other analogues were synthesized highlighting the utility of the method and new accessibility to this range of chemical space. A novel xanthene was also synthesized through controlled Lewis acid promoted rearrangement of a spiroketal trimer.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8208;MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single&#8208;Site Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Boron&#8208;containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron&#8208;containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous&#160;B2(OH)2xO(3 &#8211; x)&#160;(x = 0 &#8208; 3)&#160;layer. Yet, the precise nature of the active site(s) remains elusive. In this communication, we provide a detailed characterization of zeolite MCM&#8208;22 isomorphously substituted with boron (B&#8208;MWW). Using&#160;11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B&#8208;MWW exist as isolated BO3&#160;units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B&#8208;MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site&#8208;isolated BO3&#160;units are the active site in boron&#8208;based catalysts. This observation is at odds with other traditionally studied catalysts like vanadium&#8208;based catalysts and provides an important piece of the mechanistic puzzle.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrophysiological characterization of transport across outer membrane channels from Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)</title>
      <dc:description>Multi&#8208;drug resistance in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is often associated with low permeability of the outer membrane. To investigate the role of membrane channels in the uptake of antibiotics here, we show a robust approach using fusion of native outer membrane vesicles (OMV) into planar lipid bilayer, which moreover allows also characterization of membrane protein channels in their native environment. Two major membrane channels from  E. coli  , OmpF and OmpC, were overexpressed from the host and the corresponding OMVs were collected. Each OMV fusion revealed surprisingly single or only a few channel activities. The asymmetry of the OMV&#180;s translates after fusion into the lipid membrane with the LPS dominantly present at the side of OMV addition. Compared to conventional reconstitution method, the channels fused from OMVs containing LPS have similar conductance but a much broader distribution and significantly lower permeation. We suggest using outer membrane vesicles as a fast and easy approach for functional and structural studies of membrane channels in the native membrane.</dc:description>

      <title>Excimer and Exciplex Formation in Gold(I) Complexes Preconditioned by Aurophilic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Excimers and exciplexes are defined as assemblies of atoms or molecules  A  /  A  &#180; where interatomic /intermolecular bonding appears only in excited states like [  A  2  ]* (for excimers) and [  AA&#180;  ]*[ (for exciplexes). Their formation has become widely known owing to the important role it plays for gas phase laser technologies, but its significance in general chemistry terms has been given little attention.&#160; Recent investigations in gold chemistry have opened up a new field of excimer and exciplex chemistry which relies largely on the preorganization of two&#8208;coordinate gold(I) compounds (with the gold atoms in the closed&#8208;shell 5d  10  electronic configuration) through aurophilic contacts. In the excimers&#160; the intimate aggregation&#160;arises&#160; from&#160; a new type of Au&#8211;Au bonding where the bond energies and distances estimated from experimental and theoretical studies approach those of ground state Au&#8211;Au bonds observed in compounds with the metal atoms in the oxidation states Au  0  (5d  10  s  1  ) and Au  II  (5d  9  ). To provide this background, the chemistry of the gold molecule Au  2  and its complexes which contain the Au  0  &#8211;Au  0  bond, and of compounds with the [Au  II  &#8211;Au  II  ]  4+  core unit, are briefly described, followed by a survey of relevant aspects of aurophilic interactions. Finally, the current knowledge of excimers and exciplexes in gold chemistry is reviewed focusing mainly on simple examples including e.g. the fascinating "antielectrostatic" association of the dicyanoaurate(I) anions in solids and in solution. In all cases, excimer formation gives rise to a broad spectrum of luminescence and related photophysical effects, for which some of the relaxation dynamics have recently been clarified. There is a wide scope for future progress in excimer/exciplex research in inorganic chemistry not only of gold, but also of its neighboring elements in the periodic table. Excimers.have also been shown to be active as photoredox gold catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Reagents for Selective Fluoromethylation &#8208; a Challenge in Organofluorine Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The introduction of a monofluoromethyl moiety has undoubtedly become a very important area of research in recent years.

      <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Insertion of Carbonyl Substrates into Cu&#8208;H: Different Rate&#8208;Limiting Steps as a Function of Electrophilicity</title>

      <title>General Strategy for Synthesis of Ordered Pt3M Intermetallics with Ultrasmall Particle&#8208;size</title>
      <dc:description>Controllable synthesis of atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial to obtain superior electrocatalytic performance for fuel cell reactions, but still remains arduous.  Herein, we demonstrate  a novel and general hydrogel&#8208;freeze drying strategy  for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (  rGO  ) supported Pt  3  M (M= Mn, Cr, Fe and Co etc.) intermetallic NPs (Pt  3  M/rGO&#8208;HF) with ultrasmall particle&#8208;size (about 3 nm) and dramatic monodispersity. The formation of hydrogel prevents the aggregation of graphene oxide and significantly promotes their excellent dispersion, while a freeze&#8208;drying can retain the hydrogel derived three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) porous structure and immobilize the metal precursors with defined atomic ratio on GO support during solvent sublimation, which is not afforded by traditional oven drying. The subsequent annealing process produces rGO supported ultra&#8208;small ordered Pt  3  M intermetallic NPs (~3 nm) due to confinement effect of 3D porous structure.  Such Pt  3  M intermetallic NPs exhibit the smallest particle size among the reported ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts.  A detailed study of the synthesis of ordered intermetallic Pt  3  Mn/rGO catalyst is provided as an example of a generally applicable method. This study provides an economical and scalable route for the controlled synthesis of Pt&#8208;based intermetallic catalysts, which can pave a way for the commercialization of fuel cell technologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous and Segmented Semiconducting Fiber&#8208;like Nanostructures with Spatially Selective Functionalization by Living Crystallization&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control.

      <title>Boron Nitride Nanosheets as Heat&#8208;porter Enabled a Long&#8208;life Zinc&#8208;based Flow Battery</title>
      <dc:description>The capability to maintain a constant system temperature is vital in nature, since it endows the system with enhanced lifetime. This trait also works for zinc&#8208;based batteries, because their cycle&#8208;life is limited by notorious zinc dendrite/accumulation, which are highly affected by the inhomogeneous distribution of temperature on electrode and relatively low mechanical strength of membrane. Herein, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with high mechanical strength serving as heat&#8208;porter are introduced onto a porous substrate to enable uniform deposition of zinc and further a zinc&#8208;based flow battery with long cycle&#8208;life. The results indicate that BNNSs can effectively adjust the deposited zinc from needle&#8208;like to French fries&#8208;like morphology, thus affording the battery with a stable performance for nearly 500 cycles at 80 mA cm  &#8208;2  . Most importantly, an energy efficiency of above 80% can be obtained even at 200 mA cm  &#8208;2  , which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc&#8208;based flow batteries.</dc:description>

Most importantly, an energy efficiency of above 80% can be obtained even at 200 mA cm  &#8208;2  , which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc&#8208;based flow batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Drug screening in human cells by NMR allows early assessment of drug potency</title>
      <dc:description>Structure&#8208;based drug development is often hampered by the lack of in vivo activity of promising compounds screened in vitro, due to low membrane permeability or poor intracellular binding selectivity. Here we show that ligand screening can be performed in living human cells by &#8216;intracellular protein&#8208;observe&#8217; NMR, without requiring enzymatic activity measurements or other cellular assays. Quantitative binding information is obtained by fast, inexpensive  1  H NMR experiments, providing intracellular dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent ligand binding curves, from which kinetic and thermodynamic parameters linked to cell permeability and binding affinity and selectivity are obtained. The approach was applied to carbonic anhydrase and, in principle, can be extended to any NMR&#8208;observable intracellular target. The results obtained are directly related to the potency of candidate drugs, i.e. the required dose. The application of this approach at an early stage of the drug design pipeline could greatly increase the low success rate of modern drug development.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Developing electrolyte compatible with efficient and reversible cycling of electrodes is critical to the success of rechargeable Li metal batteries. Upon investigating the Coulombic efficiency and cycle life of Li metal batteries with ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, ethylene sulfite and their combinations as electrolyte solvents, we find that in a binary&#8208;solvent electrolyte, the extent of electrolyte decomposition on electrode surface is strongly dependent on the solvent component that dominates the solvation sheath of Li  +  .

      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight (MW) protein assemblies in a non&#8208;amorphous precipitate.

      <title>Spatially Controlled Supramolecular Polymerization of Peptide Nanotubes by Microfluidics</title>
      <dc:description>The recent advances in the supramolecular polymerization of synthetic building blocks in aqueous conditions has given rise to new artificial and biocompatible functional materials. However, despite the importance of spatially resolved self&#8208;assembly for natural and artificial molecular machines, the spatial control of supramolecular polymerization with synthetic monomers has not been experimentally established yet.

This method allowed the precise preferential localization of the fibres either at the interface or into the core of the droplets. UV absorbance, circular dichroism and fluorescence microscopy indicated that the microfluidic control of the stimuli (changes in pH or ionic strength) can be employed to adjust the packing degree and the spatial position of microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes. Additionally, this spatially organized supramolecular polymerization of peptide nanotubes was applied in the assembly of highly ordered two&#8208;dimensional droplet networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Prospect of Sulfurized Pyrolyzed Poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention S@pPAN: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.

      <dc:description>
Heterobifunctional rotaxanes serve as catalysts for the addition of malonates to Michael acceptors. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913781), J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al. report a series of heterobifunctional rotaxanes, featuring an amine&#8208;based thread and a chiral phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based macrocycle.

      <title>Production of Hydroxy Acids: Selective Double Oxidation of Diols by Flavoprotein Alcohol Oxidase</title>
      <dc:description>
Triple action: The flavoprotein alcohol oxidase (AOX*) facilitates the double and triple oxidations of diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. Such biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids has potential for the preparation of polyester building blocks.







Abstract
Flavoprotein oxidases can catalyze oxidations of alcohols and amines by merely using molecular oxygen as the oxidant, making this class of enzymes appealing for biocatalysis. The FAD&#8208;containing (FAD=flavin adenine dinucleotide) alcohol oxidase from P. chrysosporium facilitated double and triple oxidations for a range of aliphatic diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. For example, diethylene glycol could be selectively and fully converted into 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethoxy)acetic acid. Such a facile cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids opens up new avenues for the preparation of polyester building blocks.

      <title>Supracolloidal Self&#8208;Assembly of Divalent Janus 3D DNA Origami via Programmable Multivalent Host/Guest Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Combined forces: Adamantane and &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin functionalized 3D DNA origami Janus colloids are used for cooperative multivalent interaction enhancement of supramolecular host/guest interactions resulting in 1D&#8208;fibril formation. The merger of DNA nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry gives access to study multivalent effects at a colloidal level.







Abstract
We introduce divalent 3D DNA origami cuboids as truly monodisperse colloids and harness their ability for precision functionalization with defined patches and defined numbers of supramolecular binding motifs. We demonstrate that even adamantane/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin host/guest inclusion complexes of moderate association strength can induce efficient supracolloidal fibrillization at high dilution of the 3D DNA Origami as a result of cooperative multivalency. We show details on the assembly of Janus and non&#8208;Janus 3D DNA origami into supracolloidal homo&#8208; and heterofibrils with respect to multivalency effects, electrostatic screening, and stoichiometry. We believe that the merger of 3D DNA origami with colloidal self&#8208;assembly and supramolecular motifs provides new synergies at the interface of these disciplines to better understand multivalency effects, to promote structural complexity, and add non&#8208;DNA assembling and switching mechanisms to DNA nanoscience.

      <title>A Multiaction and Multitarget Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(IV) Conjugate Combining Cancer Activated Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy to Overcome Drug Resistant Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer has emerged as one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Pt(II) complexes are commonly used to treat this condition. To reduce their side effects and improve their pharmacological properties, Pt(IV) complexes are being developed as prodrug candidates that are activated by reduction in cancer cells. Concomitantly, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received increasing attention over the last years. Among other compounds studied as photosensitizers (PSs), Ru(II) polypyridine complexes have gained much attention over the recent years due to their attractive characteristics. In this article, the first example of a novel Pt(IV)&#8208;Ru(II) conjugate, which combines cancer activated chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy, is presented. Upon entering the cancer cell, the Pt(IV) centre is reduced to Pt(II) and the axial ligands including the Ru(II) complex and phenylbutyrate are released. As each component has its individual target, the conjugate exerts a multitarget and multiaction effect with (photo&#8208;)cytotoxicity values upon irradiation up to clinically relevant 595 nm in the low nanomolar range in various (drug resistant) 2D monolayer cancer cells and 3D multicellular tumour spheroids.</dc:description>

      <title>Protection strategies enable selective conversion of biomass</title>
      <dc:description>Selective and economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass components, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, to bio&#8208;based fuels and chemical, is the major goal of biorefineries but low yields and selectivities for fuel precurors such as sugars, furanics, and lignin&#8208;derived monomers pose significant disadvantages in process economics. It is widely recognized that a low selectivity results because degradation and/or condensation of biomass components occurs during its fractionation and conversion. Research efforts to minimize such undesirable side&#8208;reactions include optimization of reaction parameters and catalysts, equilibrium&#8208;controlled physical protection, and kinetic&#8208;controlled chemical protection. In most cases, the optimization of reaction parameters and catalysts has achieved limited selectivity improvements due to the parallel side&#8208;reactions associated with most of the biomass chemical conversion pathways. In this article, we summarized the existing protection strategies during biomass chemocatalytic conversion processes and focus the discussions on mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities of each strategy. We introduce a concept of using analogous methods to manipulate biomass catalytic conversion pathways during upgrading of carbohyrates to fuels and chemicals. We anticipate that this article may provide new insights into the development of selective biorefining processes from a different perspective, expanding the options for selective conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyhalogen and Polyinterhalogen Anions from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
      <dc:description>
The diverse field of polyhalogen anions and polyinterhalide chemistry is explored in terms of the structural diversity and chemical behavior of these anions as well as their applications. While the first anions of this class were described almost one hundred years ago, recent research has focused on the synthesis, structural diversity, and bonding of polyhalogen anions of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.







Abstract
This Review deals with the evolving field of polyhalogen chemistry, specifically polyhalogen anions (polyhalides). In addition to a historical outline, current progress in synthetic approaches towards the formation of polyfluorides, polychlorides, polybromides, and polyinterhalides is also illustrated. The structural diversity of polyhalides has substantially increased in the past decade, especially for polychlorides and polybromides, which are commonly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Polyfluorides have been examined by sophisticated state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and investigated spectroscopically in noble gas matrix&#8208;isolation experiments under cryogenic conditions at 4&#8197;K. The bonding in such polyhalide systems is also discussed. The last Section deals with applications of polyhalides in halogenation reactions and electrochemistry as well as their use as reactive ionic liquids, emphasizing the promising future of polyhalogen chemistry.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanomaterials for Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer therapy: Recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for photothermal therapy including their optical properties, synthesis methods, surface modification, and applications is reviewed. The unique properties and advantages of 2D nanomaterials have been successfully used in photothermal therapy and combined photothermal therapy. This application will continue to be attractive and need further exploration.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are currently explored as novel photothermal agents because of their ultrathin structure, high specific surface area, and unique optoelectronic properties. In addition to single photothermal therapy (PTT), 2D nanomaterials have demonstrated significant potential in PTT&#8208;based synergistic therapies. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in 2D nanomaterials for enhanced photothermal cancer therapy over the last five years. Their unique optical properties, typical synthesis methods, and surface modification are also covered. Emphasis is placed on their PTT and PTT&#8208;synergized chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. The major challenges of 2D photothermal agents are addressed and the promising prospects are also presented.

      <title>Conformational Dynamics of Monomer&#8208; versus Dimer&#8208;like Features in a Naphthalenediimide&#8208;Based Conjugated Cyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
A shining duo: A pair of conjugated cyclophane enantiomers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Cyclo&#8208;NDIs, is reported. The spatial electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI is modulated by external stimuli such as the temperature and solvent polarity, resulting in large optical changes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based cyclophanes (Cyclo&#8208;NDIs) are reported. Each enantiomer of Cyclo&#8208;NDI exhibits a circularly polarized luminescence signal with a relatively large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3). We have further investigated the modulation of through&#8208;space electronic communication between co&#8208;facially oriented NDIs in a discrete Cyclo&#8208;NDI with changes in the temperature. Tuning of the electronic communication results from the conformational transformation of monomer&#8208; versus dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI, as confirmed by UV/Vis, fluorescence, circular dichroic, and NMR spectroscopic analysis. The temperature&#8208;dependent optical response in the Cyclo&#8208;NDI through the conformational transformation could be utilized as a highly sensitive and reversible optical thermometer in a wide temperature range (100 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C).

      <title>Fabrication of Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks in Uninterrupted Mesoporous Tunnels: Hierarchical Structure for Efficient Trypsin Immobilization and Stabilization</title>
      <dc:description>Hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) are highly promising in various applications like enzyme immobilization. So far most reported HP&#8208;MOFs are prepared based on the generation of mesopores in microporous frameworks, and the formed mesopores are connected by microporous channels, limiting the accessibility of mesopores for bulky molecules seriously. Here we report a new hierarchical structure by constructing microporous MOFs in uninterrupted mesoporous tunnels. By using the confined space in as&#8208;prepared mesoporous silica, highly dispersed metal precursors for MOFs are coated on the internal surface of mesoporous tunnels. Ligand vapor&#8208;induced crystallization method is subsequently employed to enable quantitative formation of MOFs in situ, in which sublimated ligands diffuse into mesoporous tunnels and react with metal precursors. The obtained hierarchically porous composites possessing micropores in uninterrupted mesopores exhibit record&#8208;high adsorption capacity for the bulky molecule trypsin.

      <title>Formation and Characterization of a BeOBeC Multiple Radical Featuring a Quartet Carbyne Moiety</title>
      <dc:description>Through reaction of beryllium dimers with carbon monoxide, a carbonyl complex BeBeCO is formed in solid neon. Upon visible light excitation, the BeBeCO complex rearranges to a BeCOBe isomer, which further isomerizes to a low&#8208;energy BeOBeC species under UV&#8208;visible light excitation. These species are identified on the basis of infrared absorption spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical studies. The BeOBeC molecule is characterized to be a multiple radical species having an electronic quintet ground state featuring an unusual quartet carbyne unit with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center. Bonding analysis indicates that the strong Pauli repulsion between carbon 2s lone pair electrons and the &#963; electrons of the BeOBe fragment significantly weakens the Be&#8208;C bonding and destabilizes the triplet state of the BeOBeC radical with a doublet carbyne unit.

      <title>Engineering of novel nanostructures by simple tuning of lipid combinations</title>
      <dc:description>Structural morphology is the key parameter for efficacy of nanomedicine. To date, lipid&#8208;based nanomaterial has been the most widely used material in nanomedicine and many other biomedical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been an in&#8208;depth or systematic investigation of the structure&#8208;function relationship of lipid&#8208;based nanostructures. In this report, we investigated the formulation of novel lipid&#8208;based nanostructures via simple tuning of lipid combination. To prove this concept, we used a combination of various ratio of simple and common phospholipids with different chain length (14&#8208;carbon chain DMPC: 6&#8208;carbon chain DHPC) to find out whether a myriad of novel lipid nanostructures could be obtained. Interestingly, many combinations ratio of lipid resulted in distinct lipid nanostructures.  In vitro  cell assay proved the non&#8208;toxic properties of these nanostructures. Drug encapsulation tests confirmed that they are able to load large amount of drugs for biological application.  In vivo  anti&#8208;tumor efficacy revealed that certain lipid nanostructures possessed superior tumor retardation effect, indicating the significance of this liposome structure finding. Herein, we proved that simple combinations of different lipid chain length may result in variety of novel nanostructures beyond the reported liposomes and that these distinct structures may have profound effect on their  in vitro  and  in vivo  performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable DNA Origami Motors Translocate Ballistically Over &#956;m&#160;Distances at nm/s Speeds</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by biological motor proteins, that efficiently convert chemical fuel to unidirectional motion there has been considerable interest in developing synthetic analogues. Among the synthetic motors created thus far, DNA motors that undertake discrete steps on RNA tracks have shown the greatest promise. Nonetheless, DNA nanomotors lack intrinsic directionality, are low speed and take a limited number of steps prior to stalling or dissociation. Herein, we report the first example of a highly tunable DNA origami motor that moves linearly over micron distances at an average speed of 40 nm/min. Importantly, nanomotors move unidirectionally without intervention through an external force field or a patterned track. Because DNA origami enables precise testing of nanoscale structure&#8208;function relationships, we were able to experimentally study the role of motor shape, chassis flexibility, leg distribution, and total number of legs in tuning performance. An anisotropic rigid chassis coupled with a high density of legs maximizes nanomotor speed and endurance.</dc:description>

      <title>Unraveling the Impact of Gold(I)&#8208;Thiolate Motifs on the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides an efficient strategy to synthesize highly luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs), however, rational control of emission energy and intensity of metal NCs is still challenging. This communication reveals the impact of surface Au(I)&#8208;thiolate motifs on the AIE properties of Au NCs, by employing a series of water&#8208;soluble glutathione (GSH)&#8208;coordinated Au complexes and NCs as a model (i.e., [Au10SR10], [Au15SR13], [Au18SR14], and [Au25SR18]&#8208;, where SR denotes thiolate ligand). Detailed spectroscopic investigations manifest that the emission wavelength of Au NCs is adjustable in a broad spectrum from visible to near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) regime by controlling the length of the Au(I)&#8208;SR motifs on NC surface. More interestingly, reducing the length of Au(I)&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au(0)&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence. This effect becomes more prominent when the degree of aggregation of Au NCs increases in solution. The findings revealed in this study not only provide fundamental insights into the emission origin of metal NCs, but also offer guiding principles in rational design of luminescent metal NCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Water Structure Bonded to the Phosphate Groups at the Electrified Zwitterionic Phospholipid Membranes/Aqueous Interface</title>
      <dc:description>Gaining insight into the water structure at the electrified phospholipid membranes/aqueous interface is vital and essential for elucidating the mechanism of many biochemical reactions, but still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, based on the superiority of surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy combined with electrochemistry in interfacial analysis, for the first time, the evolution of local water structure at the zwitterionic phospholipid membranes/aqueous interface with an external electric field is revealed by means of the ions perturbation. The strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water directly bonded to the phosphate groups (PO 2  &#8722;  ) has a strong mechanical strength to resist potential perturbations, and it is that such portion of water greatly affects the electrostatic properties of the phospholipid membranes.

      <title>Protein Structure&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Zeolite&#8208;Like Networks as Biomacromolecule Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>Fabrication of zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) for advanced applications such as enzyme immobilization is of great interest but represents a great synthetic challenge. Herein, we have developed a new strategy using proteins as structure&#8208;directed agents to direct the formation of new ZMOFs that can act as versatile platforms for in&#8208;situ encapsulation of proteins under ambient conditions in aqueous solution. Notably, protein incorporation directs the formation of a ZMOF with a sodalite (  sod  ) topology instead of a non&#8208;porous diamondoid (  dia  ) topology under analogous synthetic conditions. An in&#8208;depth investigation into the mechanism of the encapsulation process revealed that histidine moieties in proteins played a crucial role in the observed templating effect. Modulating histidine content thereby influenced the resultant MOF product (from  dia  to  dia  +  sod  mixture and, ultimately, to  sod  MOF). Moreover, the resulting ZMOFs incorporated proteins (e.g. enzyme and antibody) and preserved their activity even after the stress of high temperatures and organic solvents. Specifically, biocatalysis and biopharmaceutical formulation applications are enabled. This study demonstrates the first example, to our knowledge, of proteins as structure&#8208;directed agents for new crystalline metal&#8208;organic materials and paves the way for in&#8208;situ incorporation of biomacromolecules into porous materials for multiple applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Styrenes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8208;H Olefination Enabled by an Amino Amide Transient Directing Group</title>
      <dc:description>The atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral styrenes remains a formidable challenge, due to their relatively lower rotational barriers compared to the biaryl atropoisomers. Herein, we describe the construction of axially chiral styrenes by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H olefination, using a bulky amino amide as transient chiral auxiliary. Various axially chiral styrenes were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 95% yield and 99% ee). The resulting axially chiral styrenes derivatized chiral carboxylic acids showed superior enantiocontrol over the biaryl counterparts in Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation of thioamide. Mechanistic studies suggest that C&#8208;H cleavage is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Antibody Mimics Inhibit Cadherin&#8208;Mediated Cell&#8211;Cell Adhesion: A Promising Strategy for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (MIP&#8208;NPs) block the N&#8208;terminal region of cadherins, the principal site responsible for cell&#8211;cell adhesion. The MIP&#8208;NPs mimic therapeutic antibodies employed in cancer treatment by disrupting cell&#8211;cell adhesion, as confirmed by the disintegration of three&#8208;dimensional tumor spheroids of human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells.







Abstract
One of the most promising strategies to treat cancer is the use of therapeutic antibodies that disrupt cell&#8211;cell adhesion mediated by dysregulated cadherins. The principal site where cell&#8211;cell adhesion occurs encompasses Trp2 found at the N&#8208;terminal region of the protein. Herein, we employed the naturally exposed highly conserved peptide Asp1&#8208;Trp2&#8208;Val3&#8208;Ile4&#8208;Pro5&#8208;Pro6&#8208;Ile7, as epitope to prepare molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (MIP&#8208;NPs) to recognize cadherins. Since MIP&#8208;NPs target the site responsible for adhesion, they were more potent than commercially available therapeutic antibodies for inhibiting cell&#8211;cell adhesion in cell aggregation assays, and for completely disrupting three&#8208;dimensional tumor spheroids as well as inhibiting invasion of HeLa cells. These biocompatible supramolecular anti&#8208;adhesives may potentially be used as immunotherapeutic or sensitizing agents to enhance antitumor effects of chemotherapy.

      <title>Advances in the Cathode Materials for Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Cathode materials: Developing new types of cathode materials is the best way towards the next&#8208;generation of rechargeable lithium batteries. To achieve this goal, understanding the principles of the materials and recognizing the problems confronting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cathode materials are essential prerequisites.







Abstract
The accelerating development of technologies requires a significant energy consumption, and consequently the demand for advanced energy storage devices is increasing at a high rate. In the last two decades, lithium&#8208;ion batteries have been the most robust technology, supplying high energy and power density. Improving cathode materials is one of the ways to satisfy the need for even better batteries. Therefore developing new types of positive electrode materials by increasing cell voltage and capacity with stability is the best way towards the next&#8208;generation Li rechargeable batteries. To achieve this goal, understanding the principles of the materials and recognizing the problems confronting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cathode materials are essential prerequisites. This Review presents various high&#8208;energy cathode materials which can be used to build next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. It includes nickel and lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide materials, high voltage spinel oxides, polyanion, cation disordered rock&#8208;salt oxides and conversion materials. Particular emphasis is given to the general reaction and degradation mechanisms during the operation as well as the main challenges and strategies to overcome the drawbacks of these materials.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Nucleic Acid Sensors for Liquid Biopsy Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Biopsies from blood samples: In this minireview, the development of sensors for non&#8208;invasive cancer diagnosis and management, an approach referred to as &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221;, is discussed. This application has very demanding performance requirements as high sensitivity and specificity are needed to detect bloodborne nucleic acids in patient samples. Electrochemical and spectroscopic approaches that demonstrate potential for this important biomedical problem are discussed.







Abstract
Circulating tumour nucleic acids (ctNAs) are released from tumours cells and can be detected in blood samples, providing a way to track tumors without requiring a tissue sample. This &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; approach has the potential to replace invasive, painful, and costly tissue biopsies in cancer diagnosis and management. However, a very sensitive and specific approach is required to detect relatively low amounts of mutant sequences linked to cancer because they are masked by the high levels of wild&#8208;type sequences. This review discusses high&#8208;performance nucleic acid biosensors for ctNA analysis in patient samples. We compare sequencing&#8208; and amplification&#8208;based methods to next&#8208;generation sensors for ctDNA and ctRNA (including microRNA) profiling, such as electrochemical methods, surface plasmon resonance, Raman spectroscopy, and microfluidics and dielectrophoresis&#8208;based assays. We present an overview of the analytical sensitivity and accuracy of these methods as well as the biological and technical challenges they present.

      <title>When Nanozymes Meet Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes contain atomically active sites and they are similar to natural metalloenzymes; they hold great promise in sensing, degradation of organic pollutants, and in therapeutic applications. Moreover, single&#8208;atom catalysts help to unravel structure&#8211;activity relationships and thereby uncover the nature of biocatalysts at a single&#8208;atom scale.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, coined nanozymes, have been researched widely as they offer unparalleled advantages in terms of low cost, superior activity, and high stability. The complex structure and composition of nanozymes has led to extensive investigation of their catalytic sites at an atomic scale, and to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biocatalysis occurring. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), characterized by atomically dispersed active sites, have provided opportunities for mimicking metalloprotease and for bridging the gap between natural enzymes and nanozymes. In this Minireview, we illustrate the unique properties of nanozymes and we discuss recent advances in the synthesis, characterization, and applications of SACs. Subsequently, we outline the impressive progress made in single&#8208;atom nanozymes and we discuss their applications in sensing, degradation of organic pollutants, and in therapeutic roles. Finally, we present the major challenges and opportunities remaining for a successful marriage of nanozymes and SACs.

      <title>Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon with Atomically Dispersed FeN4 for Ultraefficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Smart doping: When Fe&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 single crystals were pyrolyzed, catalytically active FeN4 centers were atomically dispersed in a 3D hierarchical ordered porous carbon matrix. The interconnected carbon skeleton sufficiently meets the mass transfer requirement, thus boosting the catalytic efficiency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
The low catalytic activity and poor mass transport capacity of platinum group metal free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts seriously restrict the application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Catalysts derived from Fe&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 could in theory be as active as Pt/C thanks to the high intrinsic activity of FeN4; however, the micropores fail to meet rapid mass transfer. Herein, an ordered hierarchical porous structure is introduced into Fe&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 single crystals, which were subsequently carbonized to obtain an FeN4&#8208;doped hierarchical ordered porous carbon (FeN4/HOPC) skeleton. The optimal catalyst FeN4/HOPC&#8208;c&#8208;1000 shows excellent performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.80&#8197;V in 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4 solution, only 20&#8197;mV lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.82&#8197;V). In a real PEMFC, FeN4/HOPC&#8208;c&#8208;1000 exhibits significantly enhanced current density and power density relative to FeN4/C, which does not have an optimized pore structure, implying an efficient utilization of the active sites and enhanced mass transfer to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

      <title>Photochemical Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Cyclobutylation of C(sp3)&#8208;Centered Radicals
</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;lying SOMO radicals, generated in&#8197;situ under visible&#8208;light photoredox conditions, undergo an efficient addition to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, providing a straightforward access to valuable alkylated cyclobutanes.







Abstract
A new photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative radical addition approach to functionalized cyclobutanes is described. The reaction involves an unprecedented formal Giese&#8208;type addition of C(sp3)&#8208;centered radicals to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The mild photoredox conditions, which make use of a readily available and bench stable phenyl sulfonyl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane, proved to be amenable to a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;amino and &#945;&#8208;oxy carboxylic acids, providing a concise route to 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes. Furthermore, kinetic studies and DFT calculations unveiled mechanistic details on bicyclo[1.1.0]butane reactivity relative to the corresponding olefin system.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High&#8208;lying SOMO radicals&lt;/b&gt;, generated in&#8197;situ under visible&#8208;light photoredox conditions, undergo an efficient addition to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, providing a straightforward access to valuable alkylated cyclobutanes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative radical addition approach to functionalized cyclobutanes is described. The reaction involves an unprecedented formal Giese&#8208;type addition of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;centered radicals to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The mild photoredox conditions, which make use of a readily available and bench stable phenyl sulfonyl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane, proved to be amenable to a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;amino and &#945;&#8208;oxy carboxylic acids, providing a concise route to 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes. Furthermore, kinetic studies and DFT calculations unveiled mechanistic details on bicyclo[1.1.0]butane reactivity relative to the corresponding olefin system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nitride Spinel: An Ultraincompressible High&#8208;Pressure Form of BeP2N4</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitride spinel: At 47&#8197;GPa and 1800&#8197;K phenakite&#8208;type BeP2N4 was transformed into the spinel&#8208;type form of BeP2N4 using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. Its crystal structure was investigated using pressure&#8208;dependent in situ synchrotron XRD measurements and its isothermal bulk modulus was determined to &gt;300&#8197;GPa, which renders spinel&#8208;type BeP2N4 an ultraincompressible material.







Abstract
Owing to its outstanding elastic properties, the nitride spinel &#947;&#8208;Si3N4 is of considered interest for materials scientists and chemists. DFT calculations suggest that Si3N4&#8208;analog beryllium phosphorus nitride BeP2N4 adopts the spinel structure at elevated pressures as well and shows outstanding elastic properties. Herein, we investigate phenakite&#8208;type BeP2N4 by single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and report the phase transition into the spinel&#8208;type phase at 47&#8197;GPa and 1800&#8197;K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. The structure of spinel&#8208;type BeP2N4 was refined from pressure&#8208;dependent in situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements down to ambient pressure, which proves spinel&#8208;type BeP2N4 a quenchable and metastable phase at ambient conditions. Its isothermal bulk modulus was determined to 325(8)&#8197;GPa from equation of state, which indicates that spinel&#8208;type BeP2N4 is an ultraincompressible material.

      <title>Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Sequential Heck/Sonogashira Coupling: Asymmetric Synthesis of Oxindoles Containing Trifluoromethylated Quaternary Stereogenic Centers</title>
      <dc:description>
Pd and Cu work together: A highly enantioselective Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed Heck/Sonogashira coupling reaction was developed to prepare chiral oxindoles containing quaternary stereogenic centers, particularly trifluoromethylated ones. The synthetic utilities of this enantioselective protocol were exemplified through several stereospecific derivatizations and the synthesis of EGIS&#8208;12,233, a potent and selective antagonist for 5&#8208;HT6/7 receptors.







Abstract
An asymmetric palladium and copper co&#8208;catalyzed Heck/Sonogashira reaction between o&#8208;iodoacrylanilides and terminal alkynes to synthesize chiral oxindoles was developed. In particular, a wide range of CF3&#8208;substituted o&#8208;iodoacrylanilides reacted with terminal alkynes, affording the corresponding chiral oxindoles containing trifluoromethylated quaternary stereogenic centers in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (94&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). This asymmetric Heck/Sonogashira reaction provides a general approach to access oxindole derivatives containing quaternary stereogenic centers including CF3&#8208;substituted ones.

      <title>Encapsulation of a Porous Organic Cage into the Pores of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhanced CO2 Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile &#8220;host&#8208;in&#8208;host&#8221; approach has been utilized to prepare functional porous organic molecule based hybrid materials by encapsulating cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) cages into the nanospace of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The obtained CB6@MIL&#8208;101 composites are efficient porous adsorbents with enhanced CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 separation at low pressures.







Abstract
We present a facile approach to encapsulate functional porous organic cages (POCs) into a robust MOF by an incipient&#8208;wetness impregnation method. Porous cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) cages with high CO2 affinity were successfully encapsulated into the nanospace of Cr&#8208;based MIL&#8208;101 while retaining the crystal framework, morphology, and high stability of MIL&#8208;101. The encapsulated CB6 amount is controllable. Importantly, as the CB6 molecule with intrinsic micropores is smaller than the inner mesopores of MIL&#8208;101, more affinity sites for CO2 are created in the resulting CB6@MIL&#8208;101 composites, leading to enhanced CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 separation performance at low pressures. This POC@MOF encapsulation strategy provides a facile route to introduce functional POCs into stable MOFs for various potential applications.

      <title>Biomimetic Hydrogenation Catalyzed by a Manganese Model of [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>
The design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is reported. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H4MPT+, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is an efficient biological hydrogenation catalyst. Despite intense research, Fe complexes mimicking the active site of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase have not achieved turnovers in hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we describe the design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H4MPT+, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This activity enables asymmetric relay hydrogenation of benzoxazinones and benzoxazines, involving the hydrogenation of a chiral hydride transfer agent using our catalyst coupled to Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed hydride transfer from this agent to the substrates.

This activity enables asymmetric relay hydrogenation of benzoxazinones and benzoxazines, involving the hydrogenation of a chiral hydride transfer agent using our catalyst coupled to Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed hydride transfer from this agent to the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trackable Supramolecular Fusion: Cage to Cage Transformation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Metalloassemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular transformations are ubiquitous in natural systems, which inspire scientists to construct artificial mimics with emerging functions and applications. However, the complexity of supramolecular systems presents a major challenge to the efficient, real&#8208;time tracking of their transformation processes. Herein, we describe the trackable supramolecular transformation of a two&#8208;component molecular cage to a three&#8208;component cage through supramolecular fusion with another two&#8208;component molecular square. The use of tetraphenylethene (TPE), a chromophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, as a component for the molecular cages enables facile fluorescence monitoring of the transformation process: while both cages exhibit fluorescence emission via the restriction of intramolecular motion of the TPE motif, the interactions between TPE and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine introduced in the supramolecular fusion process result in partial fluorescence quenching and shifts in the emission maximum. This study provides a simple and efficient approach towards complex supramolecular cages with emergent functions, and demonstrates that AIE features could provide unique opportunities for the characterization of complex, dynamic supramolecular transformation processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Deactivation of Cu&#8208;exchanged Automotive Emissions NH3&#8208;SCR Catalysts Elucidated with Nanoscale Resolution using Scanning Transmission X&#8208;ray Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>To gain nanoscale insight into the underlying mechanisms of catalyst durability for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOX with an ammonia reductant, we employed scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) to study Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites with the CHA and MFI framework structures before and after a simulated 135,000 mile aging procedure. X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements were performed at the Al K&#8208; and Cu L&#8208;edges using a spot size of 50 &#215; 50 nm2. The local environment of framework Al, Cu oxidation state and geometric changes were analyzed, showing a multi&#8208;factor induced catalytic deactivation. In Cu&#8208;exchanged MFI a transformation of CuII to CuI and CuxOy was observed as a result of the aging process. We also found a spatial correlation between extra&#8208;framework Al and deactivated Cu species near the surface of the zeolite particle. In addition, a weak, positive correlation between CuI and tri&#8208;coordinated Al was present. By inspecting both Al and Cu species within fresh and aged Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites, we conclude that the importance of the preservation of isolated CuII sites trumps that of Br&#248;nsted acid sites for NH3&#8208;SCR activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis of Asymmetric [2+2] Cycloaddition in Cage&#8208;Confined Nanospace Merging Chirality with Triplet&#8208;State Photosensitization</title>
      <dc:description>The enantioselective photoreaction appears to be a long&#8208;standing challenge, considering that photodimerization of the simple nonalternant acenaphthylene (ACE) is known for 100 years but asymmetric cycloaddition of its 1&#8208;subsituted derivatives is unknown yet. Here, we report a supramolecular photochirogenic approach to utilize homochiral and photoactive &#916;/&#923;&#8208;[Pd6(RuL3)8]28+ metal&#8208;organic cage (&#916;/&#923;&#8208;MOC&#8208;16) as an effective supramolecular reactor to achieve enantioselective exited&#8208;state photocatalysis of 1&#8208;Br&#8208;ACE. By virtue of molecular cage confinement effect for preorganization of substrates, stereochemical control of triplet&#8208;state, and nanospace transfer of energy and chirality, cycloaddition of ACE gives highly conformation selective anti over syn stereoisomers, while cycloaddition of unsymmetric 1&#8208;Br&#8208;ACE results in exclusive control of regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselective product with effective enantiodifferination of a pair of anti heat&#8208;to&#8208;head stereoisomers. The enzyme mimicking photocatalysis is verified by catalytic turnover, rate enhancement and competing&#8208;guest inhibition experiments, and photocatalytic selectivity and triplet energy&#8208;transfer in molecular confined nanospace are clarified by theoretical modulations. We hope this work provides a confined nanospace engineering approach for single MOC supramolecular nanoreactor coupling photo and stereo factors to expand the burgeoning field of enantioselective photocatalysis.</dc:description>

X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals a contorted backbone for both molecules due to the steric repulsion at the inner cove position. Noticeably, the dominant structures of these molecules contain four (for CN1) or six (for CN2) localized CC double bonds embedded in nine (for CN1) or twelve (for CN2) aromatic sextet rings according to Clar&#8217;s formula, which is supported by bond length analysis and theoretical (NICS, ACID) calculations. Furthermore, Raman spectra exhibit a band associated with the longitudinal CC stretching mode of olefinic double bonds. Due to the existence of the additional olefinic bonds, both compounds show a small band gap (1.84 eV for CN1 and 1.37 eV for CN2). They also display moderate fluorescence quantum yield (35% for CN1 and 50% for CN2) owing to the contorted geometry, which can suppress aggregation in solution.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Polyaromatics by Aza&#8208;Annulative &#960;&#8208;Extension of Unfunctionalized Aromatics</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) are an important class of compounds in materials science. We report on a new aza&#8208;annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (aza&#8208;APEX) reaction that allows rapid access to a range of N&#8208;PACs in 11&#8211;84% yields from readily available unfunctionalized aromatics and imidoyl chlorides. In the presence of silver hexafluorophosphate, arenes and imidoyl chlorides couple in a regioselective fashion. The follow&#8208;up oxidative treatment with&#160;p&#8208;chloranil affords structurally diverse N&#8208;PACs, which are very difficult to synthesize. DFT calculations reveal that the aza&#8208;APEX reaction proceeds through the formal [4+2] cycloaddition of an arene and in&#8208;situ generated diarylnitrilium salt followed by sequential aromatization with relatively low activation energies. Transformation of N&#8208;PACs to nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographenes and their photophysical properties are also described.</dc:description>

      <title>Clarification of decomposition pathways in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium ion battery electrolyte through 13C&#8208;labeling of electrolyte components</title>
      <dc:description>The decomposition of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium ion battery (LIB) electrolytes leads to a highly complex mixture during battery cell operation. Furthermore, thermal strain by e.g., fast charging can initiate the degradation and generate various compounds. The correlation of electrolyte decomposition products and LIB performance fading over life&#8208;time is mainly unknown. The central reactive species in the electrolyte resulting in polymerizations products was ascribed to a monoglycolate methyl/ethyl carbonate in recent years. Recent findings evoked the consideration of an ethyl monocarbonate species as main reactive component for this study. The electrolyte decomposition reaction is investigated regarding thermal and electrochemical degradation with 13C3&#8208;labeled EC and the corresponding reaction pathways are postulated as well as a fragmentation mechanism assumption for oligomeric compounds depicted. Soluble decomposition products classes are examined and evaluated with liquid chromatography&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry and a fragmentation mechanism for oligomeric compounds postulated. This study proposes a formation scheme for oligo phosphates as well as contradictory findings regarding phosphate&#8208;carbonates, disproving monoglycolate methyl/ethyl carbonate as the central reactive species. The assumption of an ethyl monocarbonate species combines findings in this study with literature and allows straightforward decomposition routes to decomposition product classes.</dc:description>
