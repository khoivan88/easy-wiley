      <title>A chemoenzymatic approach to the synthesis of glycopeptide antibiotic analogues</title>
      <dc:description>The glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are important antibiotics that are highly challenging to synthesise due to their unique and heavily crosslinked structure. Given this, the synthetic production and diversification of this key compound class remains impractical. Furthermore, the possibility of biosynthetic reengineering of GPAs is not yet feasible as the selectivity of the biosynthetic crosslinking enzymes for altered substrates is largely unknown. Here, we show that the combination of peptide synthesis with enzymatic cyclisation enables the formation of novel examples of GPAs and provides an indication of the utility of these crucial enzymes. By accessing the biosynthetic process  in vitro  , we identify peptide modifications that are enzymatically tolerated and can also reveal the mechanistic basis for substrate intolerance where present. Using this approach, we next specifically activate modified residues within GPAs for functionalisation at previously inaccessible positions, offering the possibility of late&#8208;stage chemical functionalisation after GPA cyclisation is complete.</dc:description>

      <title>Building an Air Stable and Lithium Deposition Regulable Garnet Interface from Moderate&#8208;Temperature Conversion Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Garnet&#8208;type electrolytes suffer from unstable chemistry against air exposure, which generates contaminants on electrolyte surface and accounts for poor interfacial contact with Li metal. Thermal treatment of the garnet at &gt; 700  o  C could remove the surface contaminates, yet it regenerates the contaminants in air, and aggravate the Li dendrite issue as more electron&#8208;conducting defective sites are exposed. In a departure from the removal approach, here we report a new surface chemistry that converts the contaminants into a fluorinated interface at moderate temperature &lt;180  o  C. The modified interface shows a high electron tunnelling barrier and a low energy barrier for Li  +  surface diffusion, so that it enables dendrite&#8208;proof Li plating/stripping at a high critical current density of 1.4 mA cm  &#8722;2  . Moreover, the modified interface exhibits high chemical and electrochemical stability against air exposure, which prevents regeneration of contaminants and keeps high critical current density of 1.1 mA cm  &#8722;2  .

      <title>Micromanipulation of Mechanically Compliant Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Optical Microwaveguides</title>
      <dc:description>Flexible organic single crystals are evolving as new materials for optical waveguides that can be used for transfer of information in organic optoelectronic microcircuits. Integration in microelectronics of such crystalline waveguides requires downsizing and precise spatial control over their shape and size at the microscale, however that currently is not possible due to difficulties with manipulation of these small, brittle objects that are prone to cracking and disintegration.

Using an AFM cantilever tip, mechanically compliant acicular microcrystals of three  N  &#8208;benzylideneanilines were bent to an arbitrary angle, sliced along their longest axis into thinner crystals, cut into shorter crystals of arbitrary length, and moved across a solid surface. When excited by using laser light, such bent microcrystals act as active optical microwaveguides that transduce their fluorescence, with the total intensity of transduced light being dependent on the optical path length. This micromanipulation of the crystal waveguides using AFM is non&#8208;invasive, and after bending their emissive spectral output remains unaltered. The approach reported here effectively overcomes the difficulties that are commonly encountered with reshaping and positioning of small delicate objects (the &#8220;thick fingers&#8221; problem), and can be applied to mechanically reconfigure organic optical waveguides in order to attain spatial control over their output in two and three dimensions in optical microcircuits.</dc:description>

      <title>Shaping Microcrystals of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Reaction&#8211;Diffusion</title>
      <dc:description>
A reaction&#8211;diffusion process involving metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) or metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOP) components as well as a crystal&#8208;growth modulator yields periodic bands containing microcrystals that have different shapes and also evolve in time into unusual (e.g., concave) shapes.







Abstract
When components of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and a crystal growth modulator diffuse through a gel medium, they can form arrays of regularly&#8208;spaced precipitation bands containing MOF crystals of different morphologies. With time, slow variations in the local concentrations of the growth modulator cause the crystals to change their shapes, ultimately resulting in unusual concave microcrystallites not available via solution&#8208;based methods. The reaction&#8211;diffusion and periodic precipitation phenomena 1)&#8197;extend to various types of MOFs and also MOPs (metal&#8211;organic polyhedra), and 2)&#8197;can be multiplexed to realize within one gel multiple growth conditions, in effect leading to various crystalline phases or polycrystalline formations.

Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy serves as an indispensable tool in chemistry and biology but often suffers from long experimental times. We present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the application of deep learning and neural networks for high&#8208;quality, reliable, and very fast NMR spectra reconstruction from limited experimental data. We show that the neural network training can be achieved using solely synthetic NMR signals, which lifts the prohibiting demand for a large volume of realistic training data usually required for a deep learning approach.

      <title>Corrosion of Heritage Objects: Collagen&#8208;Like Triple Helix Found in the Calcium Acetate Hemihydrate Crystal Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
Effloresced: Calcium acetate hemihydrate, Ca(AcO)2&#8901;
&#8201;H2O, a seemingly simple efflorescence salt grown on calcareous heritage objects was found to crystallize in a surprisingly large unit cell with 11&#8201;794.5(3)&#8197;&#197;3 and exhibits a collagen&#8208;like triple helix motif.







Abstract
Helical motifs are common in nature, for example, the DNA double or the collagen triple helix. In the latter proteins, the helical motif originates from glycine, the smallest amino acid, whose molecular confirmation is closely related to acetic acid. The combination of acetic acid with calcium and water, which are also omnipresent in nature, materializing as calcium acetate hemihydrate, was now revealed to exhibit a collagen&#8208;like triple helix structure. This calcium salt is observed as efflorescence phase on calcareous heritage objects, like historic Mollusca shells, pottery or marble reliefs. In a model experiment pure calcium acetate hemihydrate was crystallized on the surface of a terracotta vessel. Calcium acetate hemihydrate crystallizes in a surprisingly large unit cell with a volume of 11,794.5(3)&#8197;&#197;3 at ambient conditions. Acetate ions bridge neighboring calcium cations forming spiral chains, which are arranged in a triple helix motif.

      <dc:description>Nature has engineered delicate synergistic covalent and supramolecular polymers (CSPs) to achieve advanced life activities like the role of thin filament in muscle contraction. Constructing artificial synergistic CSP materials with bioinspired mechanically adaptive features, however, represents a challenging goal. Here, we report an artificial CSP system to illustrate the integration of covalent polymer (CP) and supramolecular polymer (SP) in a synergistic fashion, along with the emergence of notable mechanical and dynamic properties which are unattainable when the two polymers are formed individually. The synergistic effect relies on the peculiar network structures consisted of SPs and CPs, and thus makes the resultant CSPs an overall improvement in the mechanical performance of stiffness, strength, stretchability, toughness, and elastic recovery. Moreover, the dynamic properties including self&#8208;healing, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and reprocessing are retained in CSPs as well, manifesting themselves as programmable and tunable materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulating Charge Transfer of Lattice Oxygen in Single&#8208;Atom Doped Titania for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted much attention.

Herein, we report that regulating charge transfer of lattice oxygen in serial single&#8208;atom doped titania enables tunable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity.

We fabricate various single&#8208;atom doped titania nanosheets via a simple route to validate the proposed model.

The 28  th  Ag atom, which hardly affects the geometrical and electronic structures of the Ag&#8208;S core, triggered the emission of green light as the result of  the rigidity effect in the cluster structure  .

      <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Anatase TiO2 Nanopyramid Arrays with Oriented Electric Field</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructured oxides have been proposed as excellent electron transport materials (ETMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but this has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we exploit a facile hydrothermal approach to grow highly oriented anatase TiO2  nanopyramid arrays and further demonstrate their advantages for application in PSCs. The oriented TiO2  nanopyramid arrays afford sufficient contact area for electron extraction and increase light transmission. Moreover, the nanopyramid array/perovskite system exhibits an oriented electric field that can increase charge separation and accelerate charge transport, thereby suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the anatase TiO2  nanopyramid arrays&#8208;PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of ~22.5%, which is the highest PCE reported thus far for PSCs consisting of 1D ETMs. This work demonstrates that the rational design of 1D ETMs can achieve PSCs that perform as well as typical mesoscopic and planar PSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Resolving Sphingolipid Isomers using Cryogenic Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>1&#8208;Deoxysphingolipids are a recently described class of sphingolipids, which have been shown to be associated with several disease states including diabetic and hereditary neuropathy. The identification and characterization of 1&#8208;deoxysphingolipids and their metabolites is therefore highly important. However, exact structure determination requires a combination of sophisticated analytical techniques due to the presence of various isomers, such as ketone/alkenol isomers, carbon&#8208;carbon double bond (C=C) isomers and hydroxylation&#8208;regioisomers. Here we demonstrate that cryogenic gas&#8208;phase infrared (IR) spectroscopy of ionized 1&#8208;deoxysphingolipids enables the identification and differentiation of isomers by their unique spectroscopic fingerprints. In particular, C=C bond positions and stereochemical configurations can be distinguished by specific interactions between the charged amine and the double bond.

      <title>Vancomycin Resistance is Overcome by Conjugation of Polycationic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacterial resistance threatens to destroy the achievements of antibiotic therapy. As P. Uhl et&#8197;al. report in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002727), a 1000&#8208;fold increase in the activity of the reserve antibiotic vancomycin was achieved by using peptide conjugates. This approach reveals the potential of chemically modifying proven natural products as an alternative to the costly de&#8197;novo development of active substances.

      <title>Advances in Optical Single&#8208;Molecule Detection: En&#8197;Route to Supersensitive Bioaffinity Assays</title>
      <dc:description>
Focus on individual binding events: The necessity to detect extremely low concentrations of analytes and biomarkers has driven the development of single&#8208;molecule bioaffinity assays. This Review highlights the versatility of optical single&#8208;molecule labeling techniques, including enzymatic amplification, nanoparticulate labels, and molecular labels.







Abstract
The ability to detect low concentrations of analytes and in particular low&#8208;abundance biomarkers is of fundamental importance, e.g., for early&#8208;stage disease diagnosis. The prospect of reaching the ultimate limit of detection has driven the development of single&#8208;molecule bioaffinity assays. While many review articles have highlighted the potentials of single&#8208;molecule technologies for analytical and diagnostic applications, these technologies are not as widespread in real&#8208;world applications as one should expect. This Review provides a theoretical background on single&#8208;molecule&#8212;or better digital&#8212;assays to critically assess their potential compared to traditional analog assays. Selected examples from the literature include bioaffinity assays for the detection of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses. The structure of the Review highlights the versatility of optical single&#8208;molecule labeling techniques, including enzymatic amplification, molecular labels, and innovative nanomaterials.

      <title>A Case for Bond&#8208;Network Analysis in the Synthesis of Bridged Polycyclic Complex Molecules: Hetidine and Hetisine Diterpenoid Alkaloids</title>
      <dc:description>
A key challenge in the synthesis of diterpenoid alkaloids lies in identifying efficient strategies to construct their multiply bridged polycyclic skeletons. Approaches from eight recent syntheses are discussed in the context of &#8220;bond&#8208;network analyses&#8221;, highlighting the efficacy of bond&#8208;network analyses for synthesis planning, as well as where other considerations had to be incorporated.







Abstract
A key challenge in the synthesis of diterpenoid alkaloids lies in identifying strategies that rapidly construct their multiply bridged polycyclic skeletons. Existing approaches to these structurally intricate secondary metabolites are discussed in the context of a &#8220;bond&#8208;network analysis&#8221; of molecular frameworks, which was originally devised by Corey some 40 years ago. The retrosynthesis plans that emerge from a topological analysis of the highly bridged frameworks of the diterpenoid alkaloids are discussed in the context of eight recent syntheses of hetidine and hetisine natural products and their derivatives. This Minireview highlights the extent to which network analyses of the type described here sufficed for designing synthesis plans, as well as areas where they had to be amalgamated with functional group oriented synthetic planning considerations.

      <title>Access to Heteroleptic Fluorido&#8208;Cyanido Complexes with a Large Magnetic Anisotropy by Fluoride Abstraction</title>
      <dc:description>
Two fluorido&#8208;cyanido transition metal complexes, trans&#8208;[MIVF4(CN)2]2&#8722; (M=Re, Os), have been prepared by a synthetic approach relying on silicon&#8208;mediated fluoride abstraction. A dramatic enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy for the ReIV complex, as compared to its [ReF6]2&#8722; precursor, is demonstrated by the combined analysis of high&#8208;field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetization data.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;mediated fluoride abstraction is demonstrated as a means of generating the first fluorido&#8208;cyanido transition metal complexes. This new synthetic approach is exemplified by the synthesis and characterization of the heteroleptic complexes, trans&#8208;[MIVF4(CN)2]2&#8722; (M=Re, Os), obtained from their homoleptic [MIVF6]2&#8722; parents. As shown by combined high&#8208;field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetization measurements, the partial substitution of fluoride by cyanide ligands leads to a marked increase in the magnetic anisotropy of trans&#8208;[ReF4(CN)2]2&#8722; as compared to [ReF6]2&#8722;, reflecting the severe departure from an ideal octahedral (Oh point group) ligand field. This methodology paves the way toward the realization of new heteroleptic transition metal complexes that may be used as highly anisotropic building&#8208;blocks for the design of high&#8208;performance molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials.

      <title>N&#8208;Doping of Polyaromatic Capsules: Small Cavity Modification Leads to&#160;Large Change in Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>To gain insights into the host functions of a nanocavity encircled by both polyaromatic panels and heteroatoms, nitrogen&#8208;doped polyaromatic&#160;capsules were successfully synthesized from metal ions and pyridine&#8208;embedded, bent anthracene&#8208;based ligands. The new capsules display&#160; unique host&#8208;guest interactions in the isolated cavities, which are distinct from those of the undoped analogs. Besides the inclusion of Ag(I) ions, the large absorption change of fullerene C  60  and altered emission of a BODIPY dimer are observed upon encapsulation by the present hosts. Moreover, the N&#8208;doped capsule exhibits specific binding ability toward progesterone and methyltestosterone, known as a natural female and synthetic male hormone, respectively, in water.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Guerbet Reaction to Access Chiral Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>The first example of asymmetric Guerbet reaction has been developed.

      <title>Transition Metal Nitrides as Novel Catalyst Supports for Tuning CO/H2 Syngas Production from Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) to produce synthesis gas (syngas) with tunable CO/H  2  ratios has been studied by supporting Pd catalysts on transition metal nitride (TMN) substrates. Combining experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Pd&#8208;modified niobium nitride (Pd/NbN) is found to generate much higher CO and H  2  partial current densities and greater CO Faradaic efficiency than Pd&#8208;modified vanadium nitride (Pd/VN) and commercial Pd/C catalysts. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction identifies the formation of PdH in Pd/NbN and Pd/C under CO  2  RR conditions, whereas the Pd in Pd/VN is not fully transformed into the active PdH phase. DFT calculations show that the stabilized *HOCO and weakened *CO intermediates on PdH/NbN are critical to achieving higher CO  2  RR activity. This work suggests that NbN is a promising substrate to modify Pd, resulting in an enhanced electrochemical conversion of CO  2  to syngas with a potential reduction in precious metal loading.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Chlorides under Visible Light Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfonyl chlorides are inexpensive reactants extensively explored for functionalization, but never considered for radical hydrosulfonylation of alkenes. Herein, we report that tris(trimethylsilyl)silane is an ideal hydrogen atom donor enabling highly effective photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrosulfonylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with sulfonyl chlorides. To increase the generality of this transformation, polarity&#8208;reversal catalysis was successfully implemented for alkenes bearing alkyl substituents. This late stage functionalization method tolerates a remarkably wide range of functional groups, is operationally simple, scalable, and allows access to building blocks which are important for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogenolysis of Polysilanes Catalyzed by Low&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Si&#8722;Si bonds in polysilanes can be converted to Si&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions by using low&#8208;valent anionic Ni0 hydride catalysts. The reaction is reversible and dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes is also possible. Experiments and DFT calculations indicate that low&#8208;coordinated 14&#8208; and 16&#8208;electron d10&#8208;Ni hydrides, silyl, and silane intermediates are involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The dehydrogenation of organosilanes (RxSiH4&#8722;x) under the formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an intensively investigated process leading to oligo&#8208; or polysilanes. The reverse reaction is little studied. To date, the hydrogenolysis of Si&#8722;Si bonds requires very harsh conditions and is very unselective, leading to multiple side products. Herein, we describe a new catalytic hydrogenation of oligo&#8208; and polysilanes that is highly selective and proceeds under mild conditions. New low&#8208;valent nickel hydride complexes are used as catalysts and secondary silanes, RR&#8242;SiH2, are obtained as products in high purity.

      <title>Photoinduced Nonadiabatic Decay&#8208;guided Molecular Motor Triggers Effective Photothermal Conversion for Hyperthermia Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Photothermal agents, which can release nonradiative heat by strongly twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state and/or molecular motions in aggregates, have been implemented in photothermal therapy for treating diseases. To achieve enhanced nonradiative decay, long alkyl&#8208;chains and bulky substituents have been proposed to be introduced into the large conjugation structure, which always require complicated synthetic procedures. Thus, it remains highly challenging to strategically explore small molecule&#8208;based photothermal agents with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE). Herein, we adopt a double bond&#8208;based molecular motor  concept to develop a new class of small photothermal agents to break the current design bottleneck. As the double&#8208;bond is twisted by strong TICT upon irradiation, the excited agents can deactivate nonradiatively through the conical intersection (CI) of internal conversion, which is called as photoinduced nonadiabatic decay. Such agents thus possess a high PTCE of ~90.0%, facilitating low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy in the presence of a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) inhibitor. In addition, the behaviors and mechanism of NIR laser&#8208;triggered molecular motions for generating heat  via  the nonradiative CI pathway have been further understood by theoretical and experimental evidence, providing a feasible design principle to synthesize highly efficient photothermal and photoacoustic agents.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Conformation is one of the most fundamental concepts in organic chemistry for chemists to visualize a molecule as a three&#8208;dimensional object besides the terms constitution and configuration.

      <title>Catalytic Access to Functionalized Allylic gem&#8208;Difluorides via Fluorinative Meyer&#8208;Schuster&#8208;Like Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>An unprecedented approach for efficient synthesis of functionalized allylic gem&#8208;difluorides via catalytic fluorinative Meyer&#8722;Schuster&#8722;like rearrangement is disclosed.

      <title>A Chemistry for Incorporation of Selenium into DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional direct C&#8208;H selenylation suffers from simple selenation with limited atom economy and complicated reaction system. In this work, we designed benzoselenazolone as a novel bifunctional selenide reagent for both off&#8208; and on&#8208;DNA C&#8208;H selenylation under rhodium(III) catalysis. We showed that using benzoselenazolone allowed production of a series of selenylation products containing an adjacent aminoacyl group in a fast and efficient way, with high atom economy. The synthetic application of this method was demonstrated by taking advantage of the amide functionality as a nucleophile, directing group, and amide coupling partner.

      <dc:description>Atomic regulation of metal catalysts has emerged as an intriguing yet challenging strategy to boost the product selectivity. Here, we report a density functional theory (DFT) guided atomic design strategy to fabricate NiGa intermetallic catalyst with the completely isolated Ni sites for superior acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against Ni5Ga3 intermetallic and Ni catalysts with the ensemble Ni sites. The completely isolated Ni sites show not only preferential acetylene &#960;&#8208;adsorption, but also enhanced ethylene desorption. Further controllable synthesis of different Ni sites is confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectrometry measurements. The prediction is also validated by the experimental results that the NiGa intermetallic catalyst shows significantly enhanced selectivity to ethylene and suppressed coke formation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The live&#8208;imaging of signaling molecules released from living cells is a fundamental challenge in life sciences. Herein, we synthesized liquid crystal elastomer microspheres functionalized with horse&#8208;radish peroxidase (LCEM&#8208;HRP), which can be immobilized directly on cell membrane to monitor the real&#8208;time releasing of H  2  O  2  at the single&#8208;cell level. The LCEM&#8208;HRP could report H  2  O  2  through a concentric&#8208;to&#8208;radial (C&#8208;R) transfiguration, which is due to the deprotonation of LCEM&#8208;HRP and the break of inter or intra&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding in LCEM&#8208;HRP caused by HRP&#8208;catalyzed reduction of H  2  O  2  . The level of the transfiguration of LCEM&#8208;HRP revealed the different amounts of H  2  O  2  released from cells. The estimated detection sensitivity of the LCEM&#8208;HRP immobilized on the cells was ~2.2&#215;10  &#8208;7  &#181;M for 10 min of the detection time. The cell lines and cell&#8208;cell heterogeneity was also explored from different configurations of LCEM&#8208;HRP. The LCEM&#8208;HRP presents a new approach for in situ real&#8208;time imaging of H  2  O  2  released from the living&#8208;cells and can be the basis for seeking more advanced chemical probes for imaging of various signaling molecules in the cellular microenvironment.</dc:description>

The density functional theory calculations show that the carbonyl group at the &#947; &#8208;position of allylic alcohols are beneficial to the formation of their corresponding allylic alcohol radicals with high vertical electron affinity, which contributes to the completion of the photoredox catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Acetic Acid by a Molecular Manganese Corrole Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The controlled electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to value added chemicals is an important strategy in terms of renewable energy technologies. Therefore, the development of efficient and stable catalysts in an aqueous environment is of great importance.

      <title>A highly reversible cuprous mediated cathode chemistry for magnesium batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The sluggish kinetic and poor reversibility of cathode chemistry is the major challenge for magnesium (Mg) battery to achieve high volumetric capacity. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of the cuprous (Cu  +  ) as a charge carrier can decouple the magnesiation related energy storage from the cathode electrochemistry. Importantly, Cu  +  is generated from a fast equilibrium between copper selenide electrode and Mg electrolyte during standing time, rather than in the electrochemical process. A reversible chemical magnesiation/de&#8208;magnesiation can be driven by this solid/liquid equilibrium. During a typical discharge process, Cu  +  is reduced to Cu and drives the equilibrium to promote the magnesiation process. The reversible Cu to Cu  +  redox promotes the recharge process. This novel Cu  +  mediated cathode chemistry of Mg battery leads to a high reversible areal capacity of 12.5 mAh cm  &#8208;2  with high mass loading (49.1 mg/cm  2  ) of electrode. 80% capacity retention can be achieved for 200 cycles after conditioning process.</dc:description>

      <title>Amplified Self&#8208;Immolative Release of Small Molecules by Spatial Isolation of Reactive Groups on DNA&#8208;Minimal Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Triggering the release of small molecules in response to unique biomarkers is important for applications in drug delivery and biodetection. Due to typically low quantities of biomarker, amplifying release is necessary to gain appreciable responses. Nucleic acids have been used for both their biomarker recognition properties and as stimuli, notably in amplified small molecule release via nucleic acid&#8208;templated catalysis (NATC). The multiple components and reversibility of NATC, however, make it difficult to apply  in vivo  . Here, we report the first use the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for the amplified, conditional release of small molecules from standalone nanodevices. We first couple HCR with a DNA&#8208;templated reaction resulting in the amplified, immolative release of small molecules. Moreover, we integrate the HCR components into single nanodevices as DNA tracks and spherical nucleic acids, spatially isolating reactive groups until triggering. Overall, this work translates the amplification of HCR into small molecule release without the use of multiple components, and will aid its application to biosensing, imaging and drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Complex Polypropionates from a South China Sea Photosynthetic Mollusk: Isolation and Biomimetic Synthesis Highlighting Novel Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>Placobranchus ocellatus  is well known to produce diverse and complex  &#947;  &#8208;pyrone polypropionates. In this study, the chemical investigation of  P. ocellatus  from the South China Sea led to the discovery of ocellatusones A&#8208;D, a series of racemic non&#8208;  &#947;  &#8208;pyrone polyketides with novel skeletons, characterized by a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane (  1  ,  2  ), a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (  3  ) or a mesitylene&#8208;substituted dimethylfuran&#8208;3(2  H  )&#8208;one core (  4  ). Extensive spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical computation, chemical synthesis, and/or X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis were used to determine the structure and absolute configuration of the new compounds, including each enantiomer of racemic compounds  1  &#8208;  4  after chiral HPLC resolution. An array of new and diversity&#8208;generating rearrangements is proposed to explain the biosynthesis of these unusual compounds based on careful structural analysis and comparison with six known co&#8208;occurring  &#947;  &#8208;pyrones (  5  &#8208;  10  ). Furthermore, the successful biomimetic synthesis of ocellatusone A (  1  ) from its  &#947;  &#8208;pyrone precursor (  5  ) confirmed the biosynthetic relationship of these two compounds and the proposed rearrangement through an unprecedented acid induced cascade reaction. Besides, an initially untargeted semisynthetic product, polycyclic lactone  11  with another novel carbocyclic skeleton was proved to be naturally occurring in the mollusk by comparative LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, which provides a strategy to fish a vast number of novel trace components in Nature.</dc:description>

An array of new and diversity&#8208;generating rearrangements is proposed to explain the biosynthesis of these unusual compounds based on careful structural analysis and comparison with six known co&#8208;occurring  &#947;  &#8208;pyrones (  5  &#8208;  10  ). Furthermore, the successful biomimetic synthesis of ocellatusone A (  1  ) from its  &#947;  &#8208;pyrone precursor (  5  ) confirmed the biosynthetic relationship of these two compounds and the proposed rearrangement through an unprecedented acid induced cascade reaction. Besides, an initially untargeted semisynthetic product, polycyclic lactone  11  with another novel carbocyclic skeleton was proved to be naturally occurring in the mollusk by comparative LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, which provides a strategy to fish a vast number of novel trace components in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tunable bidirectional electroosmotic flow for diffusion&#8208;based separation</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new concept for on&#8208;chip separation that leverages bidirectional flow, to tune the dispersion regime of molecules and particles. The system can be configured such that low diffusivity species experience a ballistic transport regime and is advected through the chamber, whereas high diffusivity species experience a diffusion dominated regime with zero average velocity and are retained in the chamber. We detail the means of achieving bidirectional electroosmotic flow using an array of alternate&#8208;current (AC) field&#8208;effect electrodes, and experimentally demonstrate the separation of particles, antibodies, and dyes, and present a theoretical analysis of the system, providing engineering guidelines for its design and operation.</dc:description>

      <title>Membrane Proteins Have Distinct Fast Internal Motion and Residual Conformational Entropy</title>
      <dc:description>For a variety of reasons, the internal motions of integral membrane proteins have largely eluded comprehensive experimental characterization. Here the fast side chain dynamics of the 7&#8208;transmembrane helix protein sensory rhodopsin II and the beta&#8208;barrel bacterial outer membrane channel protein W have been investigated in lipid bilayers and detergent micelles by solution NMR relaxation techniques. Though of quite different topologies, both proteins are found to have a similar and striking distribution of methyl&#8208;bearing amino acid side chain motion that is independent of membrane mimetic. The methyl&#8208;bearing side chains of both proteins are, on average, more dynamic in the ps&#8208;ns time regime than any soluble protein characterized to date. Approximately one third of methyl&#8208;bearing side chains in both proteins exhibit extreme rotameric averaging on this timescale. Accordingly, both proteins retain an extraordinary residual conformational entropy in the folded state, which provides a counterbalance to the absence of the hydrophobic effect that normally stabilizes the folded state of water&#8208;soluble proteins. Furthermore, the large reservoir of conformational entropy that is observed provides the potential to greatly influence the thermodynamics underlying a plethora of membrane protein functions including ligand binding, allostery and signaling.</dc:description>

      <title>Droplet precise self&#8208;splitting on patterned&#8208;adhesive surfaces for simultaneous multi&#8208;detection</title>
      <dc:description>Precise separation and localization of microdroplets are fundamental for various fields such as high&#8208;throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, and complex analytes recognition. Herein, a droplet self&#8208;splitting strategy is developed to divide the impacting droplet into predictable microdroplets and deposit them to preset spots for simultaneous multi&#8208;detection. It is demonstrated that there is no matter&#8208;exchange between these microdroplets, therefore the generated microdroplets can be manipulated independently. The droplet self&#8208;splitting is attributed to the anisotropic liquid recoiling on the patterned&#8208;adhesive surface, which is influenced by the droplet Weber number and the width of the low&#8208;adhesive stripe. A quantitative criterion is further developed to judge the droplet self&#8208;splitting capability. These findings allow us to precisely separate and distribute microdroplets, which serve as isolated micro&#8208;vessels for biological screening and chemical reactions.

      <title>Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity of Pt&#8208;based Electrocatalysts: from Theoretical Mechanisms to Practical Methods</title>
      <dc:description>Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts are considered as a kind of most promising choice to facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the key factor enabling their success is to reduce the required amount of platinum. Herein, we focus on illuminating both the theoretical mechanisms which enable enhanced and sustained ORR activity and the practical methods to achieve them in catalysts. The various multi&#8208;step pathways of ORR are firstly reviewed and the rate&#8208;determining steps based on the reaction intermediates and their binding energies are analyzed. We then explain the critical aspects of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts to tune oxygen reduction properties from the viewpoints of active sites exposure and altering the surface electronic structure and summarize representative research progress towards practically achieving these activity enhancements with a focus on platinum size reduction, shape control and core Pt elimination methods. We finally outline the remaining challenges and provide our perspectives with regards to further enhancing their activities.</dc:description>

Herein, we focus on illuminating both the theoretical mechanisms which enable enhanced and sustained ORR activity and the practical methods to achieve them in catalysts. The various multi&#8208;step pathways of ORR are firstly reviewed and the rate&#8208;determining steps based on the reaction intermediates and their binding energies are analyzed. We then explain the critical aspects of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts to tune oxygen reduction properties from the viewpoints of active sites exposure and altering the surface electronic structure and summarize representative research progress towards practically achieving these activity enhancements with a focus on platinum size reduction, shape control and core Pt elimination methods. We finally outline the remaining challenges and provide our perspectives with regards to further enhancing their activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Nucleobase Modifiers Identify TET Enzymes as Bifunctional DNA Dioxygenases Capable of Direct N&#8208;Demethylation</title>
      <dc:description>TET family enzymes are known for oxidation of the 5&#8208;methyl substituent on 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA. 5mC oxidation generates the stable base 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), starting an&#160;indirect, multi&#8208;step process that ends with reversion of 5mC to unmodified cytosine. While probing the nucleobase determinants of 5mC recognition, we discovered that TET enzymes are also proficient as&#160;  direct&#160;N&#8208;demethylases of cytosine bases. We find that&#160;N&#8208;demethylase activity can be readily observed on substrates lacking a 5&#8208;methyl group and, remarkably, TET enzymes can be similarly proficient in either oxidation of 5mC or demethylation of&#160;N4&#8208;methyl substituents. Our results indicate that TET enzymes can act as both direct and indirect demethylases, highlight the active&#8208;site plasticity of these&#160;Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases, and suggest activity on unexplored substrates that could reveal new TET biology.</dc:description>

      <title>An Arylazopyrazole Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as Photoswitch on Gold Surfaces: Light&#8208;Switchable Wettability, Work Function and Conductance</title>
      <dc:description>A novel photo&#8208;responsive and fully conjugated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized to combine the excellent photophysical properties of arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) with an NHC as a robust surface anchor (AAP&#8208;BIMe). The formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold was proven by ToF&#8208;SIMS and XPS and the organic film displayed a very high stability at elevated temperatures. This stability was also reflected in a high desorption energy which was determined by temperature programmed SIMS measurements.

The effects could be explained by the difference in dipole moment of the isomers. Furthermore, a sequential application of a dummy ligand by microcontact printing and subsequent backfilling with AAP&#8208;BIMe allowed for its patterning on gold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a photoswitchable NHC on an Au surface.

      <title>Protection Strategies Enable Selective Conversion of Biomass</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalytic conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals is fraught with low selectivity. This Minireview provides an overview of the physical and chemical protection strategies used to improve selectivity in biomass conversion and describes the potential of using protection chemistry to manipulate catalytic pathways.







Abstract
Selective and economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass components to bio&#8208;based fuels and chemicals is the major goal of biorefineries, but low yields and selectivity for fuel precursors such as sugars, furanics, and lignin&#8208;derived monomers pose significant disadvantages in process economics. In this Minireview we summarize the existing protection strategies used in biomass chemocatalytic conversion processes and focus the discussions on the mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities of each strategy. We introduce a concept of using analogous methods to manipulate biomass catalytic conversion pathways during the upgrading of carbohydrates to fuels and chemicals. This Minireview may provide new insights into the development of selective biorefining processes from a different perspective, expanding the options for selective conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals.

      <title>Chemistry of Chitosan Aerogels: Three&#8208;Dimensional Pore Control for Tailored Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Biopolymers are rapidly gaining attention as sustainable precursors for lightweight porous materials for energy&#8208;saving, pharmaceutical, catalysis, and environmental remediation applications. Chitosan is an abundant biopolymer derived from food waste with attractive properties, particularly its high biocompatibility and easy chemical processability.

The properties vary widely: from supercritically dried, mesoporous chitosan aerogels to very light, freeze&#8208;dried macroporous scaffolds. Porous chitosan reaches impressive performance at laboratory scale, but the highly (meso)porous nature amplifies not only the beneficial functionality of chitosan, but also its drawbacks, leading to a serious barrier to industrialization. In order to facilitate technology transfer, we critically discuss the practical feasibility of potential chitosan aerogel applications compared to conventional and other biopolymer&#8208;based porous or nonporous materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We demonstrate a universal approach for realizing dual&#8208;wavelength lasing in organic core&#8208;shell structured microlaser arrays, which show great promise in serving as all&#8208;color laser display panels. By alternately printing hydrophilic and hydrophobic laser dye solutions on preprocessed substrates, we successfully obtained precisely patterned core&#8208;shell heterostructure arrays. The spatially&#8208;separated core and shell independently function as optical resonators to support dual&#8208;wavelength tunable microlasers in each heterostructure. Such a general method enables to flexibly control the lasing wavelength of the core&#8208;shell microlasers across a wide spectral range by systematically designing the gain media. Using as&#8208;prepared microlaser arrays as display panels, we achieved full&#8208;color laser displays, representing an achievable color gamut much larger than that of standard RGB space. These results may provide new insights for design concepts and device construction for novel optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiroptical Helices of N&#8208;terminal Aryl Amino Acids Adaptive to Orthogonal Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to peptide sequences, individual amino acids have long been identified as unfavorable candidates in fabricating functional helical structures from atomic to nanoscale due to the deficient H&#8208;bonding sites, thus limiting their applications such as optics and chiral sensing. By modified fused aryl groups at  N  &#8208;terminal, we found amino acids self&#8208;assembled into helical structures at atomic&#8208;level that could be incorporated into the modularized, ternary coassembly chiral systems whose supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties including circularly polarized light absorption and luminescence were precisely programmed. In the solid&#8208;states,  N  &#8208;terminal aryl amino acids (alanine and phenylglycine) appended with pyrene segments self&#8208;assembled into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;like structures induced by asymmetrical H&#8208;bonds between carboxylic acid and amide segments, further inducing supramolecular tilted chirality of achiral aryl groups. These building units were capable of binding melamine and electron deficient building block  via  duplex H&#8208;bonds and charge&#8208;transfer interactions in an orthogonal way. Complexation in binary coassemblies arouses significant chiroptical variations. Charge&#8208;transfer interaction enhances the dissymmetry g&#8208;factor of absorption (g  abs  ) by 1~2 order of magnitudes (up to 1.4&#215;10  &#8208;2  ) with extended Cotton effect active region (from 250 nm to 600 nm). Incorporating melamine pronouncedly inverts the handedness of circularly polarized luminescence, and selectively boosts the dissymmetry g&#8208;factor (g  lum  ). Melamine also induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality at nanoscale, whereby two dimensional lamellar structures from aryl amino acids are transformed into one dimensional helices at nanoscale. Exclusively, aryl phenylglycine synergistically integrate melamine and charge&#8208;transfer species into ternary component complexes, which self&#8208;assembled into giant tubular structures at microscale  via  helical scrolling process.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermoplastic Membranes Incorporating Semiconductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as a New Generation of Flexible X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>

The semiconductive MOF based flexible detectors exhibit efficient  X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;electric current conversion  with enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low trap density over the pelleted devices. A superior X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 65.86 &#181;CGy  air  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  is achieved, which notably outperforms  the pelleted devices and more importantly the commercial flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOFs based flexible detectors can be operated under multiple bending angles without  deteriorating  detection performance.

      <title>Thioguanosine Conversion Enables mRNA&#8208;Lifetime Evaluation by RNA Sequencing Using Double Metabolic Labeling (TUC&#8208;seq DUAL)</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel purine&#8208;nucleoside conversion chemistry paves the way for mRNA&#8208;lifetime evaluation with unprecedented precision. The technique, termed TUC&#8208;seq DUAL, uses two modified nucleosides, 6&#8208;thioguanosine (6sG) and 4&#8208;thiouridine (4sU), in subsequent pulses for metabolic labeling. Chemical treatment induces G&#8208;to&#8208;A and U&#8208;to&#8208;C mutations that are simultaneously analyzed upon RNA sequencing. Thus, synthesis and decay of mRNA can be clearly distinguished.







Abstract
Temporal information about cellular RNA populations is essential to understand the functional roles of RNA. We have developed the hydrazine/NH4Cl/OsO4&#8208;based conversion of 6&#8208;thioguanosine (6sG) into A&#8242;, where A&#8242; constitutes a 6&#8208;hydrazino purine derivative. A&#8242; retains the Watson&#8211;Crick base&#8208;pair mode and is efficiently decoded as adenosine in primer extension assays and in RNA sequencing. Because 6sG is applicable to metabolic labeling of freshly synthesized RNA and because the conversion chemistry is fully compatible with the conversion of the frequently used metabolic label 4&#8208;thiouridine (4sU) into C, the combination of both modified nucleosides in dual&#8208;labeling setups enables high accuracy measurements of RNA decay. This approach, termed TUC&#8208;seq DUAL, uses the two modified nucleosides in subsequent pulses and their simultaneous detection, enabling mRNA&#8208;lifetime evaluation with unprecedented precision.

      <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanoparticle Probes for FRET&#8208;Based Detection of Oligonucleotides with Single&#8208;Molecule Sensitivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting nanoprobes are developed based on polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating circa 1000 strongly coupled and highly emissive dye molecules capable of over 50&#8201;% FRET efficiency to a single acceptor at the DNA&#8208;functionalized surface. This nanomaterial enables unprecedented detection of single copies of DNA/RNA by using a simple epi&#8208;fluorescence microscope with ultralow excitation power close to that of ambient sunlight.







Abstract
Controlling the emission of bright luminescent nanoparticles by a single molecular recognition event remains a challenge in the design of ultrasensitive probes for biomolecules. Herein, we developed 20&#8208;nm light&#8208;harvesting nanoantenna particles, built of a tailor&#8208;made hydrophobic charged polymer poly(ethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylic acid), encapsulating circa 1000 strongly coupled and highly emissive rhodamine dyes with their bulky counterion. Being 87&#8208;fold brighter than quantum dots QDots 605 in single&#8208;particle microscopy (with 550&#8208;nm excitation), these DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles exhibit over 50&#8201;% total FRET efficiency to a single hybridized FRET acceptor, a highly photostable dye (ATTO665), leading to circa 250&#8208;fold signal amplification. The obtained FRET nanoprobes enable single&#8208;molecule detection of short DNA and RNA sequences, encoding a cancer marker (survivin), and imaging single hybridization events by an epi&#8208;fluorescence microscope with ultralow excitation irradiance close to that of ambient sunlight.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Light&#8208;harvesting nanoprobes&lt;/b&gt; are developed based on polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating circa 1000 strongly coupled and highly emissive dye molecules capable of over 50&#8201;% FRET efficiency to a single acceptor at the DNA&#8208;functionalized surface. This nanomaterial enables unprecedented detection of single copies of DNA/RNA by using a simple epi&#8208;fluorescence microscope with ultralow excitation power close to that of ambient sunlight.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the emission of bright luminescent nanoparticles by a single molecular recognition event remains a challenge in the design of ultrasensitive probes for biomolecules. Herein, we developed 20&#8208;nm light&#8208;harvesting nanoantenna particles, built of a tailor&#8208;made hydrophobic charged polymer poly(ethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylic acid), encapsulating circa 1000 strongly coupled and highly emissive rhodamine dyes with their bulky counterion. Being 87&#8208;fold brighter than quantum dots QDots 605 in single&#8208;particle microscopy (with 550&#8208;nm excitation), these DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles exhibit over 50&#8201;% total FRET efficiency to a single hybridized FRET acceptor, a highly photostable dye (ATTO665), leading to circa 250&#8208;fold signal amplification. The obtained FRET nanoprobes enable single&#8208;molecule detection of short DNA and RNA sequences, encoding a cancer marker (survivin), and imaging single hybridization events by an epi&#8208;fluorescence microscope with ultralow excitation irradiance close to that of ambient sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structure of a Protein&#8211;RNA Complex by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
An approach to determine the structure of protein&#8211;RNA complexes by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is described. The method is based on paramagnetic relaxation enhancement effects elicited on the RNA by the spin&#8208;labeled protein, and on chemical shift perturbations. This method offers unprecedented access to specific protein&#8211;RNA interactions in large complexes.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight (MW) protein assemblies in a non&#8208;amorphous precipitate. The technique yields atomic resolution structural information on both soluble and insoluble particles without limitations of MW or requirement of crystals. Herein, we propose and demonstrate an approach that yields the structure of protein&#8211;RNA complexes (RNP) solely from ssNMR data. Instead of using low&#8208;sensitivity magnetization transfer steps between heteronuclei of the protein and the RNA, we measure paramagnetic relaxation enhancement effects elicited on the RNA by a paramagnetic tag coupled to the protein. We demonstrate that this data, together with chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;perturbation data, yields an accurate structure of an RNP complex, starting from the bound structures of its components. The possibility of characterizing protein&#8211;RNA interactions by ssNMR may enable applications to large RNP complexes, whose structures are not accessible by other methods.

      <title>A Glycosylated Cationic Block Poly(&#946;&#8208;peptide) Reverses Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance in All ESKAPE Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
The glycosylated cationic &#946;&#8208;peptide PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12 sensitizes the drug&#8208;resistant ESKAPE Gram&#8208;negative bacteria to multiple antibiotics by facilitating penetration through the outer membrane, and by deactivating efflux pump systems, opening an avenue for novel combination therapies for life&#8208;threatening bacterial infections.







Abstract
Carbapenem&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacteria (GNB) are heading the list of pathogens for which antibiotics are the most critically needed. Many antibiotics are either unable to penetrate the outer&#8208;membrane or are excluded by efflux mechanisms. Here, we report a cationic block &#946;&#8208;peptide (PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12) that reverses intrinsic antibiotic resistance in GNB by two distinct mechanisms of action. PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12 does not only compromise the integrity of the bacterial outer&#8208;membrane, it also deactivates efflux pump systems by dissipating the transmembrane electrochemical potential. As a result, PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12 sensitizes carbapenem&#8208; and colistin&#8208;resistant GNB to multiple antibiotics in vitro and in vivo. The &#946;&#8208;peptide allows the perfect alternation of cationic versus hydrophobic side chains, representing a significant improvement over previous antimicrobial &#945;&#8208;peptides sensitizing agents. Together, our results indicate that it is technically possible for a single adjuvant to reverse innate antibiotic resistance in all pathogenic GNB of the ESKAPE group, including those resistant to last resort antibiotics.

      <title>Heterologous Expression and Engineering of the Nitrogenase Cofactor Biosynthesis Scaffold NifEN</title>
      <dc:description>
NifEN resembles the catalytic component of nitrogenase, NifDK, in structure and function. The expression and engineering of a NifEN variant, which mimics NifDK in retaining the cofactor at an analogous binding site, in E.&#8197;coli is reported. This observation demonstrates the feasibility of generating a functional NifDK equivalent on a NifEN template, which could facilitate future heterologous expression and mechanistic investigation of nitrogenase.







Abstract
NifEN plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of nitrogenase, catalyzing the final step of cofactor maturation prior to delivering the cofactor to NifDK, the catalytic component of nitrogenase. The difficulty in expressing NifEN, a complex, heteromultimeric metalloprotein sharing structural/functional homology with NifDK, is a major challenge in the heterologous expression of nitrogenase. Herein, we report the expression and engineering of Azotobacter vinelandii NifEN in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and spectroscopic analyses demonstrate the integrity of the heterologously expressed NifEN in composition and functionality and, additionally, the ability of an engineered NifEN variant to mimic NifDK in retaining the matured cofactor at an analogous cofactor&#8208;binding site. This is an important step toward piecing together a viable pathway for the heterologous expression of nitrogenase and identifying variants for the mechanistic investigation of this enzyme.

      <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson&#8208;Phase Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics with Improved Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimensional DJ: A Dion&#8211;Jacobson&#8208;phase lead&#8208;free perovskite, (BEA)FAn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 (BEA=1,4&#8208;butanediamine, FA=formamidinium), is used to fabricate perovskite solar cells. The representative (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 perovskite exhibits excellent optical absorption and carrier transport, resulting in a record power conversion efficiency of 6.43&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;butanediamine (BEA) is incorporated into FASnI3 (FA=formamidinium) to develop a series of lead&#8208;free low&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson&#8208;phase perovskites, (BEA)FAn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1. The broadness of the (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 band gap appears to be influenced by the structural distortion owing to high symmetry. The introduction of BEA ligand stabilizes the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure (formation energy ca. 106&#8197;j&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. The compact (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 dominated film enables a weakened carrier localization mechanism with a charge transfer time of only 0.36&#8197;ps among the quantum wells, resulting in a carrier diffusion length over 450&#8197;nm for electrons and 340&#8197;nm for holes, respectively. Solar cell fabrication with (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.43&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. The devices can retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 1000&#8197;h without encapsulation under N2 environment.

      <title>Spatially Controlled Supramolecular Polymerization of Peptide Nanotubes by Microfluidics</title>
      <dc:description>
Spatially regulated assembly of synthetic supramolecular fibers is controlled in a microfluidic device. Modulation of chemical triggers such as pH or ionic strength allowed the spatial organization of supramolecular fibers confined in water droplets. 2D suprastructures can be assembled by controlling the organization of droplet and fibrillar assembly.







Abstract
Despite the importance of spatially resolved self&#8208;assembly for molecular machines, the spatial control of supramolecular polymerization with synthetic monomers had not been experimentally established. Now, a microfluidic&#8208;regulated tandem process of supramolecular polymerization and droplet encapsulation is used to control the position of self&#8208;assembled microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes in water droplets. This method allows the precise preferential localization of fibers either at the interface or into the core of the droplets. UV absorbance, circular dichroism and fluorescence microscopy indicated that the microfluidic control of the stimuli (changes in pH or ionic strength) can be employed to adjust the packing degree and the spatial position of microfibrillar bundles of cyclic peptide nanotubes. Additionally, this spatially organized supramolecular polymerization of peptide nanotubes was applied in the assembly of highly ordered two&#8208;dimensional droplet networks.

      <title>A New Dimension for Coordination Polymers and Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Towards Functional Glasses and Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>
Heart of glass: The liquid/glass states of coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constitute a new class of amorphous materials and are related to ionic liquids and other ionic soft materials. The unique energy landscape and dynamics of liquid/glass CPs/MOFs with coordination networks offer additional opportunities for properties and functions that are complementary to those of the crystalline state.







Abstract
There are two categories of coordination polymers (CPs): inorganic CPs (i&#8208;CPs) and organic ligand bridged CPs (o&#8208;CPs). Based on the successful crystal engineering of CPs, we here propose noncrystalline states and functionalities as a new research direction for CPs. Control over the liquid or glassy states in materials is essential to obtain specific properties and functions. Several studies suggest the feasibility of obtaining liquid/glassy states in o&#8208;CPs by design principles. The combination of metal ions and organic bridging ligands, together with the liquid/glass phase transformation, offer the possibility to transform o&#8208;CPs into ionic liquids and other ionic soft materials. Synchrotron measurements and computational approaches contribute to elucidating the structures and dynamics of the liquid/glassy states of o&#8208;CPs. This offers the opportunity to tune the porosity, conductivity, transparency, and other material properties. The unique energy landscape of liquid/glass o&#8208;CPs offers opportunities for properties and functions that are complementary to those of the crystalline state.

      <title>Reducing Detrimental Defects for High&#8208;Performance Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Watching the defects: Defects play a pivotal role in the overall performance of perovskite solar cells. This Review focuses on central questions of &#8220;what defects exist in metal halide perovskites&#8221; and &#8220;how can one reduce detrimental defects towards high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells&#8221;.







Abstract
In several photovoltaic (PV) technologies, the presence of electronic defects within the semiconductor band gap limit the efficiency, reproducibility, as well as lifetime. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have drawn great attention because of their excellent photovoltaic properties that can be achieved even without a very strict film&#8208;growth control processing. Much has been done theoretically in describing the different point defects in MHPs. Herein, we discuss the experimental challenges in thoroughly characterizing the defects in MHPs such as, experimental assignment of the type of defects, defects densities, and the energy positions within the band gap induced by these defects. The second topic of this Review is passivation strategies. Based on a literature survey, the different types of defects that are important to consider and need to be minimized are examined. A complete fundamental understanding of defect nature in MHPs is needed to further improve their optoelectronic functionalities.

Abstract
Polymeric 
[Bi]&#8722; in KBi&#8901;NH3 has planar zigzag chains with two&#8208;connected Bi atoms and metallic properties, whereas KBi, which has helical chains of Bi atoms, is semiconducting. The isomerization of the Bi chain is induced by solvate molecules. In the novel layered solvate structure uncharged 
[KBi] layers are separated by intercalated NH3 molecules. These layers are a structural excerpt of the iso(valence)electronic CaSi, whose metallic properties arise from the planarity of the zigzag chain of Si atoms. Computational studies support this view, they show an anisotropic metallic behavior along the Bi chain. Electron delocalization is also found in the new cyclic anion [Bi6]4&#8722; isolated in K2[K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[Bi6]&#8901;9&#8201;NH3. Although [Bi6]4&#8722; should exhibit one localized double bond, electron delocalization is observed in analogy to the lighter homologues [P6]4&#8722; and [As6]4&#8722;. Both compounds were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination.

      <title>Characterization of [2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Bridged Protein Complexes and Reaction Intermediates by use of Native Mass Spectrometric Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
[2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged complexes are characterized by use of online buffer exchange coupled to native mass spectrometry (OBE nMS). Cluster&#8208;transfer reactions between holo complexes and apo ferredoxin (FDX2) are monitored by use of OBE nMS, and intermediate Fe&#8211;S species are detected.







Abstract
Many iron&#8211;sulfur proteins involved in cluster trafficking form [2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged complexes that are often challenging to characterize because of the inherent instability of the cluster at the interface. Herein, we illustrate the use of fast, online buffer exchange coupled to a native mass spectrometry (OBE nMS) method to characterize [2Fe&#8211;2S]&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged proteins and their transient cluster&#8208;transfer intermediates. The use of this mechanistic and protein&#8208;characterization tool is demonstrated with holo glutaredoxin&#8197;5 (GLRX5) homodimer and holo GLRX5:BolA&#8208;like protein&#8197;3 (BOLA3) heterodimer. Using the OBE nMS method, cluster&#8208;transfer reactions between the holo&#8208;dimers and apo&#8208;ferredoxin (FDX2) are monitored, and intermediate [2Fe&#8211;2S] species, such as (FDX2:GLRX5:[2Fe&#8211;2S]:GSH) and (FDX2:BOLA3:GLRX5:[2Fe&#8211;2S]:GSH) are detected. The OBE nMS method is a robust technique for characterizing iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster&#8208;bridged protein complexes and transient iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster transfer intermediates.

      <title>Electrochemiluminescence Waveguide in Single Crystalline Molecular Wires</title>
      <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional crystalline molecular wires can act as both electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters and active ECL waveguides (ECLWs). Self&#8208;generated ECL can be well confined in and propagates along the wire for up to ca. 100&#8197;&#956;m to emit strongly at the terminals. ECLWs are promising for contactless electrochemical analysis.







Abstract
Here we report the first observation of active waveguide of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in single crystalline molecular wires self&#8208;assembled from cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, namely tris(1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline&#8208;C2, N) (Ir(piq)3). Under dark conditions, the molecular wires deposited on the electrode surface can act as both ECL emitters and active waveguides. As revealed by ECL microscopy, they exhibit the typical characteristics of optical waveguides, transmitting ECL and generating much brighter ECL emission at their terminals. Moreover, self&#8208;generated ECL can be confined inside the molecular wire and propagates along the longitudinal direction as far as &#8776;100&#8197;&#956;m to the terminal out of touch with the electrode. Therefore, this one&#8208;dimensional crystalline molecular wire&#8208;based waveguide offers the opportunity to switch the electrochemically generated ECL to remote light emission in non&#8208;conductive regions and is promising for contactless electrochemical analysis and study of (bio)chemical systems.

      <title>Access to 1,3&#8208;Dinitriles by Enantioselective Auto&#8208;tandem Catalysis: Merging Allylic Cyanation with Asymmetric Hydrocyanation</title>
      <dc:description>
All together now: A one&#8208;pot conversion of allylic alcohols into 1,3&#8208;dinitriles by enantioselective auto&#8208;tandem catalysis has been developed. This novel asymmetric transformation, which consists of an allylic cyanation with concomitant hydrocyanation, proceeds in high yield and enantioselectivity for a broad range of substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective auto&#8208;tandem catalysis represents a challenging yet highlight attractive topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle that merges allylic cyanation and asymmetric hydrocyanation. The one&#8208;pot conversion of a broad array of allylic alcohols into their corresponding 1,3&#8208;dinitriles proceeds in good yield with high enantioselectivity. The products are densely functionalized and can be easily transformed to chiral diamines, dinitriles, diesters, and piperidines. Mechanistic studies clearly support a novel sequential cyanation/hydrocyanation pathway.

      <title>Intracellular Electrochemical Nanomeasurements Reveal that Exocytosis of Molecules at Living Neurons is Subquantal and Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Partial chemical release: Partial chemical release allows nerve cells to control the signal at the site of release during individual events, in which the smaller the fraction released, the greater the range of regulation. Intracellular electrochemistry at a nanotip electrode combined with theoretical modeling shows that the vesicular octopamine content is very large and the exocytotic fraction released from a living Drosophila larval neuro&#8208;muscular neuron is very small.







Abstract
Since the early work of Bernard Katz, the process of cellular chemical communication through exocytosis, quantal release, has been considered to be all or none. Recent evidence has shown exocytosis to be partial or &#8220;subquantal&#8221; at single&#8208;cell model systems, but there is a need to understand this at communicating nerve cells. Partial release allows nerve cells to control the signal at the site of release during individual events, for which the smaller the fraction released, the greater the range of regulation. Herein, we show that the fraction of the vesicular octopamine content released from a living Drosophila larval neuromuscular neuron is very small. The percentage of released molecules was found to be only 4.5&#8201;% for simple events and 10.7&#8201;% for complex (i.e., oscillating or flickering) events. This large content, combined with partial release controlled by fluctuations of the fusion pore, offers presynaptic plasticity that can be widely regulated.

      <title>Migratory Hydrogenation of Terminal Alkynes by Base/Cobalt Relay Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A relay: A base and cobalt relay catalytic process for the selective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes and conjugated E&#8197;alkenes by migratory hydrogenation of terminal alkynes was developed. And the corresponding terminal alkenes can also be readily obtained by slightly tuning the reaction conditions, thus allowing a divergent synthesis of 1&#8208;alkenes and either Z&#8208; or E&#8208;internal alkenes by hydrogenation of terminal alkynes with effective control of the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Migratory functionalization of alkenes has emerged as a powerful strategy to achieve functionalization at a distal position to the original reactive site on a hydrocarbon chain. However, an analogous protocol for alkyne substrates is yet to be developed. Herein, a base and cobalt relay catalytic process for the selective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes and conjugated E&#8197;alkenes by migratory hydrogenation of terminal alkynes is disclosed. Mechanistic studies support a relay catalytic process involving a sequential base&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of terminal alkynes and cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of either 2&#8208;alkynes or conjugated diene intermediates. Notably, this practical non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system enables efficient control of the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity of this transformation.

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Supported Facile Conversion of Uranyl(VI) into Uranium(IV) in Organic and Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>
Going for a swim: A picolinate complex of UVIO22+ is slowly converted by Na2S2O4 into a water&#8208;insoluble trinuclear UIV oxo hydroxo cluster via a stable UVO2+ intermediate. It is the first example of conversion of a uranyl(VI) compound into a well&#8208;defined molecular UIV species in aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Reduction of uranyl(VI) to UV and to UIV is important in uranium environmental migration and remediation processes. The anaerobic reduction of a uranyl UVI complex supported by a picolinate ligand in both organic and aqueous media is presented. The [UVIO2(dpaea)] complex is readily converted into the cis&#8208;boroxide UIV species via diborane&#8208;mediated reductive functionalization in organic media. Remarkably, in aqueous media the uranyl(VI) complex is rapidly converted, by Na2S2O4, a reductant relevant for chemical remediation processes, into the stable uranyl(V) analogue, which is then slowly reduced to yield a water&#8208;insoluble trinuclear UIV oxo&#8208;hydroxo cluster. This report provides the first example of direct conversion of a uranyl(VI) compound into a well&#8208;defined molecular UIV species in aqueous conditions.

      <title>Thermal and Nonthermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrochemistry at Nanostructured Ag Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy bypassing inaccuracies in local temperature measurement was invented for quantitatively disentangling hot electron effect and thermal effect in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrochemical reactions, unveiling the dominant and potential&#8208;dependent role of thermal effect at nanostructured Ag electrodes.







Abstract
Hot carriers (HCs) and thermal effects, stemming from plasmon decays, are crucial for most plasmonic applications. However, quantifying these two effects remains extremely challenging due to the experimental difficulty in accurately measuring the temperature at reaction sites. Herein, we provide a novel strategy to disentangle HCs from photothermal effects based on the different traits of heat dissipation (long range) and HCs transport (short range), and quantitatively uncover the dominant and potential&#8208;dependent role of photothermal effect by investigating the rapid&#8208; and slow&#8208;response currents in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrochemistry at nanostructured Ag electrode. Furthermore, the plasmoelectric surface potential is found to contribute to the rapid&#8208;response currents, which is absent in the previous studies.

      <title>Photoinduced Single&#8208;Electron Transfer as an Enabling Principle in the Radical Borylation of Alkenes with NHC&#8211;Borane</title>
      <dc:description>
A photoinduced SET process enables the direct B&#8722;H bond activation of NHC&#8211;boranes. The resulting NHC&#8211;boryl radical was used for the borylation of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes and alkenes with diverse electronic and structural features, providing facile access to highly functionalized borylated molecules.







Abstract
A photoinduced SET process enables the direct B&#8722;H bond activation of NHC&#8211;boranes. In contrast to common hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) strategies, this photoinduced reaction simply takes advantage of the beneficial redox potentials of NHC&#8211;boranes, thus obviating the need for extra radical initiators. The resulting NHC&#8211;boryl radical was used for the borylation of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes and alkenes with diverse electronic and structural features, providing facile access to highly functionalized borylated molecules. Labeling and photoquenching experiments provide insight into the mechanism of this photoinduced SET pathway.

      <title>Developing New Cancer Nanomedicines by Repurposing Old Drugs</title>
      <dc:description>The high morbidity and mortality of cancer urge for innovative therapeutics. Very recently, several old drugs approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or undergoing clinical trials, such as 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose, disulfiram, artemisinin, chloroquine, metformin and aspirin, which have been extensively applied clinically for the treatments of other diseases with reliable evidences of biosafety, have been engineered into nanosystems for enhancing cancer therapy. These old drugs can cooperate with other components of nanosystems or the ambient biological environments, to favor tumor&#8208;specific therapeutics by nontoxicity&#8208;to&#8208;toxicity transition. This minireview provides a concentrated summary of the most recent progresses made in this emerging field, highlighting the &#8220;old drugs, new uses&#8221; strategy for favoring the construction of next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. It is expected that the clinical translation of nanomedicines can be accelerated by repurposing old drugs to elevate cancer therapeutic efficacy and specificity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high morbidity and mortality of cancer urge for innovative therapeutics. Very recently, several old drugs approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or undergoing clinical trials, such as 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose, disulfiram, artemisinin, chloroquine, metformin and aspirin, which have been extensively applied clinically for the treatments of other diseases with reliable evidences of biosafety, have been engineered into nanosystems for enhancing cancer therapy. These old drugs can cooperate with other components of nanosystems or the ambient biological environments, to favor tumor&#8208;specific therapeutics by nontoxicity&#8208;to&#8208;toxicity transition. This minireview provides a concentrated summary of the most recent progresses made in this emerging field, highlighting the &#8220;old drugs, new uses&#8221; strategy for favoring the construction of next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. It is expected that the clinical translation of nanomedicines can be accelerated by repurposing old drugs to elevate cancer therapeutic efficacy and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reversibly thermosecreting organogels with switchable lubrication and anti&#8208;icing performance</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic gels with switchable interfacial properties have great potential in smart devices and controllable transport. Herein, we design an organogel by incorporating a binary liquid mixture with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) into a polymer network, resulting in reversible modulation of lubrication and adhesion properties. As the temperature changes, the lubricating mechanism changes reversibly from boundary lubrication to hydrodynamic lubrication due to the phase separation within the binary solution permeating the gel (friction coefficient from 0.4 to 0.03). Droplets appear on the gel surface at low temperature and disappear when the temperature is higher than the critical phase separation temperature (T  ps  ) of organogel. This organogel possesses a relatively low ice adhesive strength (less than 1 kPa). This material has potential applications in anti&#8208;icing and smart devices, and we believe that this design strategy can be expanded to other systems such as aqueous solution and hydrogels.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrolyte Solvation Manipulation Enables Unprecedented Room&#8208;Temperature Calcium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) provide a promising option for high&#8208;energy and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology beyond current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Herein we report a solvation manipulation strategy to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of calcium metal anode by enhancing the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of calcium ions in the electrolyte.  The introduction of lithium salt greatly changes the electrolyte structure by reducing coordination number of calcium ions in the first solvation shell.  As a result, an unprecedented Coulombic efficiency (CE) of calcium metal anode for galvanostatic plating/stripping is achieved up to 99.1%, accompanying with a very stable long&#8208;term cycling performance over 200 cycles at room temperature. This work may open up a new opportunity for developing practical calcium metal batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Silver&#8208;Triggered Activity of a Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst in Oxidative Carbonylation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Silver bullet: A silver&#8208;triggered heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of allene amides was developed for the one&#8208;pot construction of pyrrolidones and polycyclic compounds with multiple chiral centers. The heterogeneous catalyst (Pd&#8208;AmP&#8208;CNC) can be recycled at least nine times without loss of activity. The Ag salt removes Cl from Pd&#8208;AmP&#8208;CNC to generate highly active PdII, which results in high efficiency of the heterogeneous catalytic system.







Abstract
A silver&#8208;triggered heterogeneous Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation has been developed. This heterogeneous process exhibits high efficiency and good recyclability, and was utilized for the one&#8208;pot construction of polycyclic compounds with multiple chiral centers. AgOTf was used to remove chloride ions in the heterogeneous catalyst Pd&#8208;AmP&#8208;CNC, thereby generating highly active PdII, which results in high efficiency of the heterogeneous catalytic system.
