      <title>Exploring the Limits of Transition Metal Fluorination at High Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorination is a proven method for challenging the limits of chemistry, both structurally and electronically. Here we explore computationally how&#160;pressures below 300 gigapascal (GPa) affects the fluorination of Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au and Hg. A plethora of new structural phases are predicted along with the possibility for synthesizing four unobserved compounds:&#160;TcF7,&#160;CdF3, OsF8, and IrF8.&#160;The Ir and Os octaflourides are both predicted to be stable as quasi&#8208;molecular phases with an unusual cubic ligand coordination, and both compounds formally correspond to a high oxidation state of +8. Electronic structure analysis&#160;reveals that otherwise unoccupied 6p levels are brought down in energy by the combined effects of pressure and a strong ligand field. The valence expansion of Os and Ir enable ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal F 2p &#8594; M 6p charge transfer that strengthens M&#8208;F bonds and decreases the overall bond polarity. The lower stability of IrF8, and the instability of PtF8&#160;and several other compounds below 300 GPa, is here explained by the occupation of M&#8208;F antibonding levels in octafluorides with a metal valence electron count exceeding 8.</dc:description>

      <title>Biosynthetically Inspired Syntheses of Secu&#8242;amamine A and Fluvirosaones A and B</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosynthetically inspiring: A vanadium&#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction of (viro)allosecurinine N&#8208;oxides afforded the key pluripotent enamine precursors that were further transformed into secu&#8242;amamine A and fluvirosaones A and B. The key steps of the transformations were biomimetic 1,2&#8208;amine shifts and/or formal [3+2] cycloadditions of the enamine.







Abstract
Presented here is a concise synthesis of secu&#8242;amamine A, and fluvirosaones A and B from readily available allosecurinine and viroallosecurinine. The key C2&#8208;enamine derivative of (viro)allosecurinine, the presumed biosynthetic precursors of these natural products, was accessed, for the first time, by a VO(acac)2&#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction. Formal hydration and 1,2&#8208;amine shift of this pluripotent enamine compound afforded secu&#8242;amamine A. Formal oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between this enamine and TMS&#8208;substituted methallyl iodide reagent paved the way to the precursors of fluvirosaones A and B. The relative stereochemistry at the C2 position of these advanced intermediates governs the fate of 1,2&#8208;amine shift leading to fluvirosaones A and B. The syntheses of potential biosynthetic precursors and investigations of their chemical reactivities have provided insights regarding the biogenesis of these natural products.

      <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of an Atomic Nickel Co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2 for Improved Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomic nickel: A facile molten&#8208;salt method is used to prepare an atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2. This system has photocatalytic H2 evolution activity that is four times higher than that of Ni nanoparticles on TiO2.







Abstract
Atomic co&#8208;catalysts offer high potential to improve the photocatalytic performance, of which the preparation with earth&#8208;abundant elements is challenging. Here, a new molten salt method (MSM) is designed to prepare atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst on widely studied TiO2 nanoparticles. The liquid environment and space confinement effect of the molten salt leads to atomic dispersion of Ni ions on TiO2, while the strong polarizing force provided by the molten salt promotes formation of strong Ni&#8722;O bonds. Interestingly, Ni atoms are found to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies (OV) on TiO2 during the MSM process, which benefits the charge transfer and hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergy of atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst and OV results in 4&#8208;time increase in H2 evolution rate compared to that of the Ni co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2 prepared by an impregnation method. This work provides a new strategy of controlling atomic co&#8208;catalyst together with defects for efficient photocatalytic water splitting.

      <title>Sodium Dithionite&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Sulfonylation: Facile Access to Tertiary Sulfones</title>

      <title>Synthesis of Poly(acyclic orthoester)s: Acid&#8208;Sensitive Biomaterials for Enhancing Immune Responses of Protein Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Drug release: While poly(orthoester)s have many advantages, the synthesis of poly(acyclic orthoester)s has not yet been reported. Here the facile synthesis of poly(acyclic orthoester)s by polycondensation of acyclic diketene acetals and diols is developed. Poly(acyclic orthoester) nanoparticles release antigens into the cytoplasm, enhancing antigen presentation efficiency, and could serve to broaden the applications of poly(orthoester)s in protein&#8208; and gene&#8208;based therapies.







Abstract
While poly(acyclic orthoester)s (PAOEs) have many appealing features for drug delivery, their application is significantly hindered by a lack of facile synthetic methods. Reported here is a simple method for synthesizing acyclic diketene acetal monomers from diols and vinyl ether, and their polymerization with a diol to first synthesize PAOEs. The PAOEs rapidly hydrolyze at lysosomal pH. With the help of a cationic lipid, ovalbumin, a model vaccine antigen was efficiently loaded into PAOEs nanoparticles using a double emulsion method. These nanoparticles efficiently delivered ovalbumin into the cytosol of dendritic cells and demonstrated enhanced antigen presentation over poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. PAOEs are promising vehicles for intracellular delivery of biopharmaceuticals and could increase the utility of poly(orthoesters) in biomedical research.

      <title>CF3SO2Na as a Bifunctional Reagent: Electrochemical Trifluoromethylation of Alkenes Accompanied by SO2 Insertion to Access Trifluoromethylated Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines</title>
      <dc:description>
Double agent: An electrochemical trifluoromethylation/SO2 insertion/cyclization process using an undivided cell proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion. Various trifluoromethylated cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines can be readily accessed from readily available materials by using Langlois&#8217; reagent as a source of both CF3 and SO2 in a single operation under direct anodically oxidative conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented electrochemical trifluoromethylation/SO2&#8197;insertion/cyclization process has been achieved in an undivided cell in an atom&#8208;economic fashion. The protocol relies on tandem cyclization of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes by using Langlois&#8217; reagent as a source of both CF3 and SO2 under direct anodically oxidative conditions, in which two C&#8722;C bonds, two C&#8722;X bonds (N&#8722;S and S&#8722;C), and two rings were formed in a single operation. This transformation enabled efficient construction of various trifluoromethylated cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines from readily accessible materials.

      <title>A Hydrolase&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Forms the Fused Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactone in Vibralactone</title>
      <dc:description>
The cyclization of an oxepinone (3) to form a fused bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactone (1) proceeds by a ring&#8208;opening aldol&#8208;lactonization cascade or a pericyclic reaction driven by the Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp catalytic triad of the cyclase VibC from the basidiomycete Boreostereum vibrans.







Abstract
Vibralactone is isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Boreostereum vibrans as one of the strongest lipase inhibitors. Its unusual &#946;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused bicycle is derived from an aryl ring moiety by an oxidative ring&#8208;expansion prior to an intramolecular cyclization. Herein, we report the discovery of the cyclase VibC which belongs to the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase superfamily and is involved in the vibralactone biosynthesis. Biochemical and crystal studies suggest that VibC may catalyze an aldol or an electrocyclic reaction initiated by the Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp catalytic triad. For the aldol and pericyclic chemistry in living cells, VibC is a unique hydrolase performing the carbocycle formation of an oxepinone to a fused bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactone. This presents a naturally occurring, new enzymatic reaction in both aldol and hydrolase (bio)chemistry that will guide future exploitation of these enzymes in synthetic biology for chemical&#8208;diversity expansion of natural products.

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Benzilic Ester Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>
Paradigm shift: Hemiketal formation is the enantio&#8208;determining step, against the commonly accepted mechanism in catalytic enantioselective rearrangement of benzilic esters.







Abstract
We report the first examples of catalytic enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement reaction. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(OTf)2 and a chiral box ligand under mild conditions, reaction of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters with alcohols afforded structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl(alkyl) substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy malonates (tartronic esters) in good to excellent yields with high enantioselectivities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that hemiketalization, rather than the dynamic kinetic resolution of hemiketal, was the enantiodetermining step under our reaction conditions.

      <title>Water&#8208;Insensitive Synthesis of Poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Peptides with Defined Architecture</title>
      <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insensitive, controllable and living &#946;&#8208;NTA polymerization was developed to prepare poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides in open vessels. The method is characterized by high yields, diverse functional groups, variable chain length, narrow dispersity, defined architecture, and easy tuning of both terminal groups.







Abstract
Biocompatible and proteolysis&#8208;resistant poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides have broad applications and are dominantly synthesized via the harsh and water&#8208;sensitive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#946;&#8208;lactams in a glovebox or using a Schlenk line, catalyzed by the strong base LiN(SiMe3)2. We have developed a controllable and water&#8208;insensitive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#946;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;thiocarboxyanhydrides (&#946;&#8208;NTAs) that can be operated in open vessels to prepare poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides in high yields, with diverse functional groups, variable chain length, narrow dispersity and defined architecture. These merits imply wide applications of &#946;&#8208;NTA polymerization and resulting poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides, which is validated by the finding of a HDP&#8208;mimicking poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptide with potent antimicrobial activities. The living &#946;&#8208;NTA polymerization enables the controllable synthesis of random, block copolymers and easy tuning of both terminal groups of polypeptides, which facilitated the unravelling of the antibacterial mechanism using the fluorophore&#8208;labelled poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptide.

      <title>Pseudo&#8208;Stereodivergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched Tetrasubstituted Alkenes by Cascade 1,3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;Allylation/Cope Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>
All possible stereoisomers: The switchable pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent synthesis of enantioenriched tetrasubstituted alkenes from isatin&#8208;based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and allylic benzoates was developed under the cooperative catalysis of a tertiary amine and a chiral iridium complex, through a diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;allylation reaction and a stereoselective 3,3&#8208;Cope rearrangement. All four possible stereoisomers are constructed with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic diastereodivergent construction of stereoisomers having two or more stereogenic centers has been extensively studied. In contrast, the switchable introduction of another stereogenic element, that is, Z/E configuration involving a polysubstituted alkene group, into the optically active stereoisomers, has not been recognized yet. Disclosed here is the pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent synthesis of highly enantioenriched tetrasubstituted alkene architectures from isatin&#8208;based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and allylic derivatives, under the cooperative catalysis of a tertiary amine and a chiral iridium complex. The success of the switchable construction of the tetrasubstituted alkene motif relies on the diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;allylation reaction between N&#8208;allylic ylides and chiral &#960;&#8208;allyliridium complex intermediates by ligand and substrate control, followed by the stereoselective concerted 3,3&#8208;Cope rearrangement process.

      <title>Solar&#8208;Powered Organic Semiconductor&#8211;Bacteria Biohybrids for CO2 Reduction into Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Lighting up Moorella: An organic semiconductor&#8211;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system is presented that efficiently reduces CO2 to produce acetic acid through the non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria Moorella thermoacetica.







Abstract
An organic semiconductor&#8211;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system is used to efficiently realize CO2 reduction to produce acetic acid with the non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria Moorella thermoacetica. Perylene diimide derivative (PDI) and poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) were coated on the bacteria surface as photosensitizers to form a p&#8208;n heterojunction (PFP/PDI) layer, affording higher hole/electron separation efficiency. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability and biocompatibility, and the cationic side chains of organic semiconductors could intercalate into cell membranes, ensuring efficient electron transfer to bacteria. Moorella thermoacetica can thus harvest photoexcited electrons from the PFP/PDI heterojunction, driving the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway to synthesize acetic acid from CO2 under illumination. The efficiency of this organic biohybrid is about 1.6&#8201;%, which is comparable to those of reported inorganic biohybrid systems.

      <title>A Direct S0&#8594;Tn Transition in the Photoreaction of Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Forget about forbiddance: Spectroscopic experiments reveal that photoreactions of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing molecules with light in an apparently non&#8208;absorbing region proceed via a forbidden direct S0&#8594;Tn transition. This phenomenon occurs in the photoreaction of aryl iodides (oxidation states I, III, and V), aryl bromides, and bismuth(III)&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
According to the Grotthuss&#8211;Draper law, light must be absorbed by a substrate to initiate a photoreaction. There have been several reports, however, on the promotion of photoreactions using hypervalent iodine during irradiation with light from a non&#8208;absorbing region. This contradiction gave rise to a mystery regarding photoreactions involving hypervalent iodine. We demonstrated that the photoactivation of hypervalent iodine with light from the apparently non&#8208;absorbing region proceeds via a direct S0&#8594;Tn transition, which has been considered a forbidden process. Spectroscopic, computational, and synthetic experimental results support this conclusion. Moreover, the photoactivation mode could be extended to monovalent iodine and bromine, as well as bismuth(III)&#8208;containing molecules, providing new possibilities for studying photoreactions that involve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing molecules.

      <title>Underestimated color centers: Defects as useful reducing agents in lanthanide&#8208;activated luminescent materials</title>
      <dc:description>Several inorganic hosts such as SrB  4  O  7  or certain nitrides are known to intrinsically stabilize Eu  2+  even upon doping with a Eu  3+  &#8208;based precursor and no employment of any reducing conditions during synthesis. Although this somewhat alchemistic concept has already been known for a long time in the field of phosphor synthesis, the mechanistic details of the intrinsic reductive action of certain hosts are only scarcely understood. Herein, we aim to demonstrate first clear experimental evidence that trapped charge carriers such as color centers can also act as potential redox partners to stabilize certain oxidation states of activators taking Eu&#8208;activated CsMgCl  3  and CsMgBr  3  as a representative example. Upon intentional doping with EuCl  3  and without employment of any reducing conditions during the synthesis, yet dominant cyan or green luminescence related to the presence of Eu  2+  ions was observed instead, respectively. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at 10 K revealed that this intrinsically occurring reduction could be clearly correlated to the presence of impurity&#8208;localized color centers. Although defects are otherwise typically undesired in phosphors, this study demonstrates that their role may be underestimated and they could be used on purpose in the preparation of selected inorganic phosphors.</dc:description>

      <title>Superoxide dismutase 1 in health and disease: How a front&#8208;line antioxidant becomes neurotoxic</title>
      <dc:description>Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a front&#8208;line antioxidant enzyme catalysing superoxide breakdown and is important for most forms of eukaryotic life. The evolution of aerobic respiration by mitochondria increased cellular production of superoxide, resulting in an increased reliance upon SOD1.

      <title>Enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction activity of platinum electrodes in alkaline media using Ni&#8208;Fe clusters</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we demonstrate an easy way to improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt electrodes in alkaline media by introducing Ni&#8208;Fe clusters. As a result, the overpotential needed to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8209;2 in H2&#8208;saturated 0.1 M KOH is reduced for the model single crystal electrodes down to ~70 mV. To the best of our knowledge, these modified electrodes outperform any other reported electrocatalysts tested under similar conditions. Moreover, the influence of (i) Ni to Fe ratio, (ii) cluster coverage, and (iii) the nature of the alkali metal cations present in the electrolyte on the HER activity has been investigated. The observed catalytic performance likely originates from both the improved water dissociation at the Ni&#8208;Fe clusters and the subsequent optimal hydrogen adsorption and recombination at Pt atoms present at the Ni&#8208;Fe/Pt boundary</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Quinoline&#8208;Malononitrile Core as a Building Block for the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of AIEgens</title>
      <dc:description>
In this minireview, recent advances related to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) building block quinoline&#8208;malononitrile are summarized. The review focuses on the AIE mechanism, regulation of emission wavelength and morphology, the facile scale&#8208;up and fast preparation for AIE nanoparticles, and potential biomedical imaging applications.







Abstract
In&#8197;vivo fluorescent monitoring of physiological processes with high&#8208;fidelity is essential in disease diagnosis and biological research, but faces extreme challenges due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and short&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. The development of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores is in high demand for precise optical bioimaging. The chromophore quinoline&#8208;malononitrile (QM) has recently emerged as a new class of AIE building block that possesses several notable features, such as red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, high brightness, marked photostability, and good biocompatibility. In this minireview, we summarize some recent advances of our established AIE building block of QM, focusing on the AIE mechanism, regulation of emission wavelength and morphology, the facile scale&#8208;up and fast preparation for AIE nanoparticles, as well as potential biomedical imaging applications.

      <title>Planar AIEgens with Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence and ROS Generation for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
Planar luminophores with excellent aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation properties that are based on intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions can serve as photosensitizers in the photodynamic therapy of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Planar luminogens have encountered difficulties in overcoming intrinsic aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching by intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Although excited&#8208;state double&#8208;bond reorganization (ESDBR) can guide us on designing planar aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens), its mechanism has yet been elucidated. Major challenges in the field include methods to efficiently restrict ESDBR and enhance AIE performance without using bulky substituents (e.g., tetraphenylethylene and triphenylamine). In this study, we rationally developed fluoro&#8208;substituent AIEgens with stronger intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction for restricted molecular motions and increased crystal density, leading to decreased nonradiative decay rate by one order of magnitude. The adjusted ESDBR properties also show a corresponding response to variation in viscosity. Furthermore, their aggregation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations have been discovered. The application of such planar AIEgen in treating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria has been demonstrated in a mouse model. The relationship between ROS generation and distinct E/Z&#8208;configurational stacking behaviors have been further understood, providing a design principle for synthesizing planar AIEgen&#8208;based photosensitizers.

      <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Cycling for Multiplexed Cellular Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Gravitationally enhanced? Black hole quenchers (BHQ) interact with fluorophores to accelerate tetrazine/trans&#8208;cyclooctene (Tz/TCO) click reactions by more than three orders of magnitude. Cells stained with fluorophore&#8208;TCO labeled antibodies (FAST probes) can be efficiently quenched in seconds with a BHQ3&#8208;Tz, eliminating time&#8208;consuming bleaching/cleavage steps and enabling rapid cellular analyses for cancer diagnostics.







Abstract
Rapid analysis of single and scant cell populations is essential in modern diagnostics, yet existing methods are often limited and slow. Herein, we describe an ultra&#8208;fast, highly efficient cycling method for the analysis of single cells based on unique linkers for tetrazine (Tz)/trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8208;mediated quenching. Surprisingly, the quenching reaction rates were more than 3 orders of magnitude faster (t1/2 &lt;1&#8197;s) than predicted. This allowed multi&#8208;cycle staining and immune cell profiling within an hour, leveraging the accelerated kinetics to open new diagnostic possibilities for rapid cellular analyses.

      <title>Harnessing Endogenous Formate for Antibacterial Prodrug Activation via in cellulo Ruthenium&#8208;mediated&#160;Transfer Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The abundance and evolving pathogenic behavior of bacterial microorganisms give rise to antibiotic tolerance and resistance which pose a danger to global public health. New therapeutic strategies are needed to keep pace with this growing threat. We propose a novel approach of targeting bacteria by harnessing formate, a cell metabolite found only in particular bacterial species, to activate an antibacterial prodrug and selectively inhibit their growth. This strategy is premised on transfer hydrogenation (TFH) reaction on a biorthogonal substrate utilizing native formate as the hydride source as a means of uncaging an antibacterial prodrug. Using coordination&#8208;directed 3&#8208;component assembly (C3A) to prepare a library of 768 unique Ru&#8208;Arene Schiff&#8208;base (RAS) complexes, we identified several candidates that efficiently reduced sulfonyl azide functional group in the presence of formate. We further designed a caged compound based on antibacterial agent sulfanilamide containing a sulfonyl azide group in place of sulfonamide as a prodrug. The lead RAS complex triggered prodrug activation in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which evolved multiple formate biosynthesis pathways, but not Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis), with limited formate biosynthesis capacity, nor mammalian cells, which are deficient in endogenous formate. This strategy paves the way for a new approach of targeted antibacterial therapy by exploiting unique bacterial metabolites.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme Mimetic Active Intermediates for Nitrate Reduction in Neutral Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrate is a pervasive aquatic contaminant of global environmental concern.

      <title>An Unprecedented Antimony(III) Borate with Strong Linear and Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
An antimony(III) borate, SbB3O6, has been synthesized. It exhibits not only a linear optical response (&#916;n=0.290 @ 546&#8197;nm), which is the largest among borates, but also a strong nonlinear optical response (SGH=3.5&#215;KH2PO4) that exceeds most borates.







Abstract
Antimony(III) borates with a stereochemical active lone pair remained unknown, although the first antimony borate was reported more than twenty years ago. Now, the first antimony(III) borate in a closed system is successfully synthesized, namely SbB3O6. Remarkably, SbB3O6 not only exhibits an exceptional linear optical response, that is, birefringence of &#916;n=0.290 at the wavelength of 546&#8197;nm, which is the largest among borates, but also has a strong nonlinear optical response of 3.5 times larger than the benchmark KH2PO4, exceeding those of most borates. Theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of strong linear and nonlinear optical responses in SbB3O6 should be attributable to the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;conjugated B&#8722;O anionic groups and Sb3+ with stereochemically active lone pair. This work provides a new class of optical bi&#8208;functional materials with potential prospects in integrated optical devices.

      <title>Supramolecular Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer in Nucleobase&#8208;Modified Fluorogenic RNA Aptamers</title>
      <dc:description>
A spy in the RNA: The fluorescent nucleobase analogue 4&#8208;cyanoindole was site&#8208;specifically incorporated into the fluorogenic Chili RNA aptamer as a reporter for binding of several ligand classes. This first application of FRET between an isomorphic nucleobase donor and an intrinsically fluorogenic ligand revealed position&#8208;dependent quantum yields and FRET efficiencies for mapping of the ligand binding site.







Abstract
RNA aptamers form compact tertiary structures and bind their ligands in specific binding sites. Fluorescence&#8208;based strategies reveal information on structure and dynamics of RNA aptamers. Herein, we report the incorporation of the universal emissive nucleobase analog 4&#8208;cyanoindole into the fluorogenic RNA aptamer Chili, and its application as a donor for supramolecular FRET to the bound ligands DMHBI+ or DMHBO+. The photophysical properties of the new nucleobase&#8211;ligand&#8208;FRET pair revealed structural restraints for the overall RNA aptamer organization and identified nucleotide positions suitable for FRET&#8208;based readout of ligand binding. This strategy is generally suitable for binding&#8208;site mapping and may also be applied for responsive aptamer devices.

      <title>A Universal Strategy toward Ultrasmall Hollow Nanostructures with Remarkable Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy is developed to fabricate ultrasmall hollow nanostructures by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene.







Abstract
A facile and versatile microwave&#8208;assisted and shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy is used to fabricate ultrasmall hollow nanoparticles by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene. This method involves that the adsorption of microwave by graphene creates a high&#8208;energy environment in a short time to decompose the in&#8197;situ grown MOF nanocrystals into well&#8208;dispersed uniform core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with ultrasmall size. Upon a shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion process, hollow nanoparticles of multi&#8208;metal oxides, phosphides, and sulfides with the diameter below 20&#8197;nm and shell thickness below 3&#8197;nm can be obtained for the first time. Ultrasmall hollow nanostructures such as Fe2O3 can promote much faster charge transport and expose more active sites as well as migrate the volume change stress more efficiently than the solid and large hollow counterparts, thus demonstrating remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage performance.

      <title>Total Synthesis of Pyrolaside B: Phenol Trimerization through Sequenced Oxidative C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Easy as 1&#8208;2&#8208;3: A facile method to oxidatively trimerize phenols using a catalytic aerobic copper system is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with low copper loading, and can also be applied to cross&#8208;coupling trimerization.

Abstract
A facile method to oxidatively trimerize phenols using a catalytic aerobic copper system is described. The mechanism of this transformation was probed, yielding insight that enabled cross&#8208;coupling trimerizations. With this method, the natural product pyrolaside&#8197;B was synthesized for the first time. The key strategy used for this novel synthesis is the facile one&#8208;step construction of a spiroketal trimer intermediate, which can be selectively reduced to give the natural product framework without recourse to stepwise Ullmann&#8208; and Suzuki&#8208;type couplings. As a result, pyrolaside&#8197;B can be obtained expeditiously in five steps and 16&#8201;% overall yield. Three other analogues were synthesized, thus highlighting the utility of the method, which provides new accessibility to this area of chemical space. A novel xanthene was also synthesized through controlled Lewis acid promoted rearrangement of a spiroketal trimer.

      <title>Activation of Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalysts by Loading with Ultrafine Rh&#8211;Cr Mixed&#8208;Oxide Cocatalyst Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles with a size of approximately 1.3&#8197;nm were loaded onto a BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst. The photocatalyst exhibited the highest quantum yield reported for BaLa4Ti4O15. The developed preparation technique of Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles is also expected to improve the activity of other advanced water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts. SG=glutathionate.







Abstract
The activity of many water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts could be improved by the use of RhIII&#8211;CrIII mixed oxide (Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3) particles as cocatalysts. Although further improvement of water&#8208;splitting activity could be achieved if the size of the Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles was decreased further, it is difficult to load ultrafine (&lt;2&#8197;nm) Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles onto a photocatalyst by using conventional loading methods. In this study, a new loading method was successfully established and was used to load Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles with a size of approximately 1.3&#8197;nm and a narrow size distribution onto a BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst. The obtained photocatalyst exhibited an apparent quantum yield of 16&#8201;%, which is the highest achieved for BaLa4Ti4O15 to date. Thus, the developed loading technique of Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles is extremely effective at improving the activity of the water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst BaLa4Ti4O15. This method is expected to be extended to other advanced water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts to achieve higher quantum yields.

      <title>Development of Chiral Organosuperbase Catalysts Consisting of Two Different Organobase Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts, which consist of a P2&#8208;phosphazene as an organosuperbase and a chiral guanidine as a hydrogen bond donor for substrate recognition, were developed based on a novel concept for a distinctive cooperative function by two organobases in a single catalyst molecule. The prominent catalytic activity was demonstrated in the enantioselective direct Mannich&#8208;type reaction of less acidic &#945;&#8208;phenylthioacetate.







Abstract
In the field of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, a new generation of chiral catalysts has been highly anticipated to overcome the intrinsic limitation of pronucleophiles that are applicable to the enantioselective reactions. Herein, we reveal conceptually new chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts consisting of two different organobase functionalities, one of which functions as an organosuperbase and the other as the substrate recognition site. Their prominent activity, which stems from the distinctive cooperative function by the two organobases in a single catalyst molecule, was demonstrated in the unprecedented enantioselective direct Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;&#8208;phenylthioacetate as a less acidic pronucleophile. The present achievement would provide a new guiding principle for the design and development of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts and significantly broaden the utility of Br&#248;nsted base catalysis in asymmetric organic synthesis.

      <title>Label&#8208;Free Imaging of Intracellular Temperature by Using the O&#8722;H Stretching Raman Band of Water</title>
      <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for imaging intracellular and extracellular temperatures using the O&#8722;H stretching Raman band of water is proposed. The method is based on changes in the O&#8722;H band shape with temperature. The shown image of the temperature changes after adding a mitochondrial uncoupling agent to a cell was obtained in a label&#8208;free manner.







Abstract
We propose a label&#8208;free method for measuring intracellular temperature using a Raman image of a cell in the O&#8722;H stretching band. Raman spectra of cultured cells and the medium were first measured at various temperatures using a Raman microscope and the intensity ratio of the two regions of the O&#8722;H stretching band was calculated. The intensity ratio varies linearly with temperature in both the medium and cells, and the resulting calibration lines allow simultaneous visualization of both intracellular and extracellular temperatures in a label&#8208;free manner. We applied this method to the measurement of temperature changes after the introduction of FCCP (carbonyl cyanide&#8208;p&#8208;trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) in living cells. We observed a temperature rise in the cytoplasm and succeeded in obtaining an image of the change in intracellular temperature after the FCCP treatment.

Most studies on fibrous proteins remain focused on the recombinant spidroins, but the formed fibers exhibit moderate mechanical performance.

Here, we demonstrate one new class of biological fibers on the basis of a designed chimeric protein, which consists of the sequences of a cationic elastin&#8208;like polypeptide and a squid ring teeth protein. Remarkably, the chimeric protein fibers exhibit a breaking strength up to ~630 MPa and the corresponding toughness as high as ~130 MJ/m  3  , making them superior to many recombinant spider silks and even comparable to some native counterparts. Therefore, this strategy represents a novel concept for exploring bio&#8208;inspired ultra&#8208;strong protein materials through the development of new types of structural chimeric proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Dimensional Matching versus Induced&#8208;Fit Distortions: Binding Affinities of Planar and Curved Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons with a Tetragold Metallorectangle</title>
      <dc:description>
Corannulene and a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage mutually adapt their shapes to maximize shape complementarity upon formation of a host&#8211;guest complex.







Abstract
A tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage containing two pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands and two carbazolyl&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl linkers is used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including corannulene. The binding affinities obtained for the encapsulation of the planar PAHs guests in CD2Cl2 are found to exponentially increase with the number of &#960;&#8208;electrons of the guest (1.3 &gt; logK &gt;6.6). For the bowl&#8208;shaped molecule of corannulene, the association constant is much lower than the expected one according to its number of electrons. The molecular structure of the host&#8211;guest complex formed with corannulene shows that the molecule of the guest is compressed, while the host is expanded, thus showing an interesting case of artificial mutual induced&#8208;fit arrangement.

      <title>Enhanced Propene/Propane Separation by Directional Decoration of the 12&#8208;Membered Rings of Mordenite with ZIF Fragments</title>
      <dc:description>
Separation of the unseparable: The 12&#8208;membered rings of mordenite (MOR) zeolite were directionally decorated with ZIF fragments. The resulting material shows greatly improved propene/propane separation performance.







Abstract
Propene/propane separation is challenging due to the very small difference in molecular sizes, boiling points and condensabilities between these molecules. Herein, we report a strategy of introducing ZIF fragments into traditional mordenite (MOR) zeolite to decorate the 12&#8208;membered ring of MOR. After decoration, the originally ineffective zeolite MOR exhibited high kinetic propene/propane selectivities (139 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and achieved efficient propene/propane separation. The propene/propane separation potentials of the resulting adsorbents were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments with equimolar propene/propane (50/50) mixtures.

      <title>MDM2&#8208;Associated Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission and Apoptosis Induction Effectuated by a Theranostic Spiropolymer</title>
      <dc:description>
A spiropolymer (P1a2b, see picture) demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction, P1a2b triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;containing spiropolymers were constructed in a facile manner by a catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent spiropolymerization route. P1a2b as the most potent of these spiropolymers, demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction, P1a2b triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating a good biocompatibility and non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells. The combined results from solution and cell&#8208;based cluster&#8208;triggered emission studies, docking, protein expression experiments and cytotoxicity data strongly support the MDM2&#8208;binding hypothesis and indicate a potential application as a fluorescent cancer marker as well as therapeutic for this spiropolymer.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition MDM2&#8208;Associated Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission and Apoptosis Induction Effectuated by a Theranostic Spiropolymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A spiropolymer&lt;/b&gt; (P1a2b, see picture) demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction, P1a2b triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroatom&#8208;containing spiropolymers were constructed in a facile manner by a catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent spiropolymerization route. &lt;b&gt;P1a2b&lt;/b&gt; as the most potent of these spiropolymers, demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction, &lt;b&gt;P1a2b&lt;/b&gt; triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating a good biocompatibility and non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells. The combined results from solution and cell&#8208;based cluster&#8208;triggered emission studies, docking, protein expression experiments and cytotoxicity data strongly support the MDM2&#8208;binding hypothesis and indicate a potential application as a fluorescent cancer marker as well as therapeutic for this spiropolymer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Boron Nitride Nanosheets Composite Membrane for a Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Based Flow Battery</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with high thermal conductivity and mechanical strength are introduced onto a porous membrane substrate to induce dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition and further enable a long&#8208;life zinc&#8208;based flow battery.







Abstract
The capability to maintain a constant system temperature is vital in nature, since it endows the system with enhanced lifetime. This trait also works for zinc&#8208;based batteries, because their cycle&#8208;life is limited by notorious zinc dendrite/accumulation, which are highly affected by the inhomogeneous distribution of temperature on electrode and relatively low mechanical strength of membrane. Herein, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with high mechanical strength serving as heat&#8208;porter are introduced onto a porous substrate to enable uniform deposition of zinc and further a zinc&#8208;based flow battery with long&#8208;cycle life. The results indicate that BNNSs can effectively adjust the deposited zinc from needle&#8208;like to French fries&#8208;like morphology, thus affording the battery with a stable performance for nearly 500 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Most importantly, an energy efficiency of above 80&#8201;% can be obtained even at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc&#8208;based flow batteries.

      <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Access to Spirocycles through C&#8722;H Activation and Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Central Chirality Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>
Pass it on: Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [4+1] spiroannulation of nitrones and ortho&#8208;quinone diazides has been realized for the enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclic 3H&#8208;indole N&#8208;oxides by merging C&#8722;H activation with axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.







Abstract
Axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer is an important strategy to construct chiral centers, where the axially chiral reagents are mostly limited to atropomerically stable ones. Reported herein is a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective spiroannulative synthesis of nitrones. The coupling proceeds via C&#8722;H arylation to give an atropomerically metastable biaryl, followed by intramolecular dearomative trapping under oxidative conditions with high degree of chirality transfer.

Abstract
Reported here is a molecule&#8208;Lego synthetic strategy for macrocycles with functional skeletons, involving one&#8208;pot and high&#8208;yielding condensation between bis(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)arene monomers and paraformaldehyde. By changing the blocks, variously functional units (naphthalene, pyrene, anthraquinone, porphyrin, etc.) can be conveniently introduced into the backbone of macrocycles. Interestingly, the macrocyclization can be tuned by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. Linear (180&#176;) monomer yield cyclic trimers and pentamers, while V&#8208;shaped (120&#176;, 90&#176; and 60&#176;) monomers tend to form dimers. More significantly, even heterogeneous macrocycles are obtained in moderate yield by co&#8208;oligomerization of different monomers. This series of macrocycles have the potential to be prosperous in the near future.

      <title>Multifunctional AuI&#8208;based AIEgens: Manipulating Molecular Structures and Boosting Specific Cancer Cell Imaging and Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;AuI complex was investigated by elaborate structural tailoring and systematic biological evaluation. It could simultaneously achieve specific imaging and inhibition of various cancer cells with negligible toxic effects on normal cells and act as a powerful radiosensitizer to boost anticancer efficacy.







Abstract
Gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (AuI&#8208;NHC) complexes have emerged as potential anticancer agents owing to their high cytotoxicity and stability. Integration of their above unique functions with customized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens to achieve specific bioimaging and efficient theranostics to cancer is highly desirable but is rarely studied. Now, a series of novel AuI&#8208;NHC compounds were developed with AIE characteristics. A complex with a PPh3 ligand was selected out as it could achieve both prominent specific imaging of various cancer cells and efficient inhibition of their growth with negligible toxic effects on normal cells due to the targeting binding and strong inhibition towards thioredoxin reductase. This complex could also act as a powerful radiosensitizer to boost the anticancer efficacy with performance superior to that of popularly used auranofin. It holds great potential as a specific and effective theranostic drug in cancer diagnosis and precise therapy.

The resultant zigzag edge topologies of GNRs are elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electronic structures of  NBN&#8208;ZGNR1  (1.50 eV, 37% zigzag edge proportion) and  NBN&#8208;ZGNR2  (0.90 eV, 57% zigzag edge proportion) are significantly different from those of their corresponding pristine fully carbon&#8208;based ZGNRs (  PCZGNR1  : 0.52 eV;  PCZGNR2  : 0.27 eV). In addition, DFT calculations predict that the electronic structures of  NBN&#8208;ZGNRs  can be further tailored to be gapless (zero bandgap) and metallic, respectively, through one&#8208;electron oxidation of each NBN unit into the corresponding radical cations.

      <title>Activatable Molecular Probes for Second Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence, Chemiluminescence, and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Optical imaging plays a crucial role in biomedicine. However, due to strong light scattering and autofluorescence in biological tissue ranging 650&#8208;900 nm, conventional optical imaging often has poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and shallow penetration depth, which limits its ability in deep&#8208;tissue  in vivo  imaging.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optical imaging plays a crucial role in biomedicine. However, due to strong light scattering and autofluorescence in biological tissue ranging 650&#8208;900 nm, conventional optical imaging often has poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and shallow penetration depth, which limits its ability in deep&#8208;tissue  in vivo  imaging. Second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging modalities mitigate these issues by their respective advantages of minimized light scattering, eliminated external excitation, and ultrasound detection.

      <title>Reviving Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for Sn&#8208;Pb Alloyed Perovskite Quantum Dots by Sodium Doping</title>
      <dc:description>Phase&#8208;stable CsSn  x  Pb  1&#8208;  x  I  3  perovskite quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise for optoelectronic applications owing to their strong response in the near&#8208;infrared region.

Ultra&#8208;low sodium (Na) doping presented in this work is found to be effective in improving PL QYs of these alloyed QDs without alerting their favorable electronic structure. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies suggest the formation of a stronger chemical interaction between I  &#8208;  and Sn  2+  ions upon Na doping, which potentially helps to stabilize Sn  2+  and suppresses the formation of I vacancy defects.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Oxynitride K2LaTa2O6N with an H+/K+&#160;Exchangeability in Aqueous Solution to Form Stable Photocatalyst for Visible&#8208;Light H2&#160;Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) undoped layered perovskite oxynitride materials have been suggested as potential visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts; however, there have been few investigations on their use as photocatalysts because of the difficulty in synthesis and stability issues when in contact with water. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a new layered perovskite oxynitride, K2LaTa2O6N, as an exceptional example of a water&#8208;tolerant photocatalyst for H2&#160;evolution under visible light. K2LaTa2O6N, prepared from KLaTa2O7&#160;and K2CO3&#160;as precursors, underwent in situ H+/K+&#160;exchange in aqueous solution while keeping its visible light absorption capability. Thus protonated K2LaTa2O6N, K2&#8211;xHxLaTa2O6N, modified with an Ir cocatalyst, exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward H2&#160;evolution in the presence of I&#8211;&#160;as an electron donor and under visible light irradiation; the activity was 6 times higher than Pt/ZrO2/TaON, one of the best&#8208;performing oxynitride photocatalysts for H2&#160;evolution. Overall water splitting was also achieved using the Ir&#8208;loaded, protonated K2LaTa2O6N in combination with Cs&#8208;modified Pt/WO3&#160;as an O2&#160;evolution photocatalyst in the presence of I3&#8211;/I&#8211;&#160;shuttle redox couple. Undoped layered oxynitrides have not been considered promising for H2&#160;evolution, owing to the low chemical stability of the oxynitrides in aqueous solution. However, the present study is expected to stimulate further research on related materials for application in solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropanes: Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Pseudotransannular Desymmetrization</title>
      <dc:description>
The chiral phosphoric acid VAPOL (green) catalyzes pseudotransannular epoxide ring opening on meso&#8208;cycloalkenylamine&#8208;derived epoxides to deliver highly enantioenriched tropanol derivatives in a single step through a very efficient desymmetrization process. This strategy was applied to the total synthesis of the two naturally occurring alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tropanol and (+)&#8208;ferruginine.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of tropanols has been accomplished through chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed pseudotransannular ring opening of 1&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;derived epoxides. The reaction proceeds together with the desymmetrization of the starting material and leads to the direct formation of the 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold with excellent stereoselectivity. The synthetic applicability of the reaction was demonstrated by the enantioselective synthesis of the two natural products (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tropanol and (+)&#8208;ferruginine.

      <title>Polyketide Cyclizations for the Synthesis of Polyaromatics</title>
      <dc:description>
The folding and cyclization of polyketide chains precisely control the divergent biosynthesis of structurally distinct aromatic natural products. In this Minireview, the virtues of transferring this biosynthetic concept into the assembly of polyaromatics is outlined. The prospects of emerging divergent cyclizations controlled by small&#8208;molecule catalysts are highlighted.







Abstract
The folding and cyclization of poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbonyl chains controlled by the intricate enzymatic polyketide synthase machinery results in a remarkable diversity of aromatic natural products. Synthetic methods that allow for the preparation of highly reactive polyketide chains while governing their folding in ensuing cyclizations likewise lead to versatile divergent preparations of aromatic scaffolds valuable for numerous applications. Although biomimetic polyketide cyclizations have repeatedly been applied in the total synthesis of polyphenol natural products, their utility for the preparation of the broad range of polyaromatic architectures has yet to reach its full potential. This Minireview highlights some of the virtues of applying polyketide logic to the retrosynthetic analysis of polycyclic aromatic scaffolds, the increasing accessibility of precursors, and the potential of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for controlling polyketide cyclizations to provide polyaromatic scaffolds.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chain&#8208;Walking Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Alkyl and Aryl Halides and Olefin Hydroarylation Enabled by Electrochemical Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach for nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling was developed. This method provides a novel route to 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane derivatives from simple and readily available alkyl and aryl halides in good yields and excellent regioselectivity under mild conditions. The procedure shows good tolerance for a broad variety of functional groups and both primary and secondary alkyl halides can be used.







Abstract
The first electrochemical approach for nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling was developed. This method provides a novel route to 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane derivatives from simple and readily available alkyl and aryl halides in good yields and excellent regioselectivity under mild conditions. The procedure shows good tolerance for a broad variety of functional groups and both primary and secondary alkyl halides can be used. Furthermore, the reaction was successfully scaled up to the multigram scale, thus indicating potential for industrial application. Mechanistic investigation suggested the formation of a nickel hydride in the electroreductive chain&#8208;walking arylation, which led to the development of a new nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of styrenes to provide a series of 1,1&#8208;diaryl alkanes in good yields under mild reaction conditions.

      <title>Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement Controlled by Optical Manipulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A focused laser beam traps a single aggregate of a protonated tetraphenylethene derivative, and the manipulation of the molecular structure in the aggregate is achieved by overcoming the repulsion force between the molecules, activating its aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE). The bright yellow fluorescence from the aggregate can be controlled through the laser power.







Abstract
We present spatiotemporal control of aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of a protonated tetraphenylethene derivative by optical manipulation. A single submicrometer&#8208;sized aggregate is initially confined by laser irradiation when its fluorescence is hardly detectable. The continuous irradiation of the formed aggregate leads to sudden and rapid growth, resulting in bright yellow fluorescence emission. The fluorescence intensity at the peak wavelength of 540&#8197;nm is tremendously enhanced with growth, meaning that AIEE is activated by optical manipulation. Amazingly, the switching on/off of the activation of AIEE is arbitrarily controlled by alternating the laser power. This result means that optical manipulation increases the local concentration, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated molecules, namely, optical manipulation changes the aggregate structure. The dynamics and mechanism in AIEE controlled by optical manipulation will be discussed from the viewpoint of molecular conformation and association depending on the laser power.

      <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Color in a Single&#8208;Component Organic Molecular Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic sunset: A time&#8208;dependent afterglow color in a single&#8208;component organic molecular crystal was observed. It originates from well&#8208;separated, long&#8208;persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with different but comparable decay rates.







Abstract
An organic crystal of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (pCBP) exhibits time&#8208;dependent afterglow color from blue to orange over 1&#8197;s. Both experimental and computational data confirm that the color evolution results from well&#8208;separated, long&#8208;persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with different but comparable decay rates. TADF is enabled by a small S1&#8211;T1 energy gap of 0.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The good separation of TADF and RTP is due to a 11.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 difference in the S0 energies of the S1 and T1 structures, indicating that apart from the excited&#8208;state properties, tuning the ground state is also important for luminescence properties. This afterglow color evolution of pCBP allows its applications in anticounterfeiting and data encryption with high security levels.

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Anhydride Dynamic Reversible Networks</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of thiols and anhydrides to form ring opened thioester/acids is shown to be highly reversible, and it is accordingly employed in the fabrication of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) that possess tunable dynamic covalent chemistry. Maleic, succinic and phthalic anhydride derivatives were used as bifunctional reactants in systems with varied stoichiometries, catalyst, and loadings. Dynamic characteristics such as temperature&#8208;dependent stress relaxation, direct reprocessing and recycling abilities of a range of thiol&#8208;anhydride elastomers, glasses, composites and photopolymers are discussed. Depending on the catalyst strength, 100% of externally imposed stresses were relaxed in the order of minutes to 2 hours at mild temperatures (80&#8208;120 &#176;C). Pristine properties of the original materials were recovered following up to five cycles of a hot&#8208;press reprocessing technique (1h/100&#176;C).</dc:description>

      <title>Porous Tantalum Nitride Single Crystal at Two Centimeter Scale with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Porous tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) single crystals, combining structural coherence and porous microstructure, would substantially improve the photoelectrochemical performance. The structural coherence would reduce the recombination of charge carriers and maintain excellent transport property while the porous microstructure would not only reduce photon scattering and but also facilitate surface reactions. Here we grow bulk&#8208;porous Ta  3  N  5  single crystals on an two centimeter scale with (002) , (023) and (041) facets, respectively, and show significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical performances. We show the preferential facet growth of porous crystals in a lattice reconstruction strategy in relation to lattice match and lattice channel. We present the facet engineering to enhance light absorption, exciton lifetime and transport properties. The porous Ta  3  N  5  single crystal boosts photoelectrochemical oxidation of alcohol with the (002) facet showing the highest performance of &gt;99% alcohol conversion and &gt;99% aldehyde/ketone selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing the Acceptor Character of Conjugated Organoborane Macrocycles: A Highly Electron&#8208;Deficient Hexaboracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>We introduce a new boron&#8208;doped cyclophane, the hexabora[1 6 ]cyclophane B6&#8208;FMes, in which six tricoordinate borane moieties alternate with short conjugated p&#8208;phenylene linkers. Exocyclic 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (FMes) groups serve not only to further withdraw electron density but at the same time sterically shield the boron atoms, resulting in a macrocycle that is both highly electron&#8208;deficient and stable to air and moisture. The optical and electronic properties are compared with those of related linear oligomers with electron&#8208;withdrawing FMes or electron&#8208;donating Mes* (2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) groups, and the electronic structure is further evaluated by computational methods. These studies uncover unique properties of B6&#8208;FMes, including a low&#8208;lying and extensively delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and a wide HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (HOMO = highest occupied molecular orbital), which arise from the combination of (a) a cyclic &#960;&#8208;system, (b) strong electronic communication between the closely spaced borons, and (c) the attachment of electron&#8208;deficient pendent groups.

      <title>Functional Analysis of a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Demonstrates Role of Spontaneous Double Bicyclo&#8208;ring Formation Including 8&#960;&#8211;6&#960; Electrocyclization in Shimalactone Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Shimalactones A and B are neuritogenic polyketides possessing characteristic oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene ring systems, produced by the marine fungus Emericella variecolor GF10. We identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster from a draft genome analysis of the fungus, and conducted a heterologous expression analysis. Expression of ShmA polyketide synthase in Aspergillus oryzae resulted in production of preshimalactone. Aspergillus oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants expressing ShmA and ShmB produced shimalactones A and B, suggesting that the double bicyclo&#8208;ring formation reactions proceed non&#8208;enzymatically from preshimalactone epoxide. Density functional theory calculations strongly support the idea that oxabicyclo&#8208;ring formation and 8&#960;&#8211;6&#960; electrocyclization proceed spontaneously after opening of the preshimalactone epoxide ring via protonation. We confirmed the formation of preshimalactone epoxide in vitro, followed by its non&#8208;enzymatic conversion to shimalactones in the dark.</dc:description>

      <title>Smart Design of Nanomaterials for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Nanotherapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>Mitochondria are the powerhouse of cells. They are vital organelles that maintain cellular function and metabolism. Dysfunction of the mitochondria results in various diseases with a great diversity of clinical appearances. In the past, strategies have been developed for fabricating subcellular&#8208;targeting drug delivery nanocarriers, enabling cellular internalization and subsequent organelle localization. Of late, innovative strategies have emerged for the smart design of multi&#8208;functional nanocarriers. Hierarchical targeting enables nanocarriers to evade and overcome various barriers encountered upon  in vivo  administration to reach the organelle with good bioavailability. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers allow controlled release of therapeutics to occur at the desired target site. Synergistic therapy can be achieved using a combination of approaches such as chemotherapy, gene and phototherapy. In this review, we surveyed the field for recent developments and strategies used in the smart design of nanocarriers for mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapeutics. Existing challenges and unexplored therapeutic opportunities are also highlighted and discussed to inspire the next generation of mitochondria&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutics.</dc:description>

Hierarchical targeting enables nanocarriers to evade and overcome various barriers encountered upon  in vivo  administration to reach the organelle with good bioavailability. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers allow controlled release of therapeutics to occur at the desired target site. Synergistic therapy can be achieved using a combination of approaches such as chemotherapy, gene and phototherapy. In this review, we surveyed the field for recent developments and strategies used in the smart design of nanocarriers for mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapeutics. Existing challenges and unexplored therapeutic opportunities are also highlighted and discussed to inspire the next generation of mitochondria&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Ene Cationic and Radical Reactions: Cyclization, Step&#8208;Growth, and Concurrent Polymerizations for Thioacetal and Thioether Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Growth potential: Thiol&#8208;ene cationic and radical reactions were achieved not only for 1:1 addition between a thiol and vinyl ether but also for cyclization and step&#8208;growth polymerization between a dithiol and divinyl ether. An organic acid and a radical initiator, respectively, led selectively to the formation of thioacetal and thioether linkages. Concurrent cationic and radical step&#8208;growth polymerization was also realized to afford polymers composed of both thioacetal and thioether linkages in the main chains.







Abstract
Thiol&#8208;ene cationic and radical reactions were conducted for 1:1 addition between a thiol and vinyl ether, and also for cyclization and step&#8208;growth polymerization between a dithiol and divinyl ether. p&#8208;Toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) induced a cationic thiol&#8208;ene reaction to generate a thioacetal in high yield, whereas 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobisisobutyronitrile resulted in a radical thiol&#8208;ene reaction to give a thioether, also in high yield. The cationic and radical addition reactions between a dithiol and divinyl ether with oxyethylene units yielded amorphous poly(thioacetal)s and crystalline poly(thioether)s, respectively. Under high&#8208;dilution conditions, the cationic and radical reactions resulted in 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal and thioether products, respectively. Furthermore, concurrent cationic and radical step&#8208;growth polymerizations were realized using PTSA under UV irradiation to produce polymers having both thioacetal and thioether linkages in the main chain.

      <title>Singlet Fission in Carbene Derived Diradicaloids</title>
      <dc:description>In large, the documentation of singlet fission (SF) is showcased in examples involving polyacenes and polyenes. SF has been hitherto studied in depth, on one hand, in solids and, on the other hand, in solutions, in which cases covalent bridges are required to link two or more chromophores. Going beyond polyacenes and polyenes is driven by exploring new classes of SF&#8208;materials. Herein, we present a new class of SF&#8208;materials based on diradicaloids of carbene scaffolds, namely cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs). Our modular approach allows for tuning two key SF&#8208;criteria: the steric factor and the diradical character. In turn, we modified the energy landscapes of excited states in a systematic manner to accommodate the needs for SF. We report the first example on intermolecular SF in solutions for CAAC dimers formed via self&#8208;assembly at cryogenic temperatures.</dc:description>

      <title>Correlating pressure&#8208;induced emission modulation with linker rotation in a photoluminescent MOF</title>
      <dc:description>Conformational changes of linker units in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often responsible for gate&#8208;opening phenomena in selective gas adsorption and stimuli&#8208;responsive optical and electrical sensing behaviour. Herein, we show that pressure&#8208;induced bathochromic shifts in both fluorescence emission and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra of a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated Hf MOF, linked by 1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethynylbenzoate) ligands (  Hf&#8208;peb  ), are induced by rotation of the central phenyl ring of the linker, from a coplanar arrangement to a twisted, previously unseen conformer. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, alongside  in situ  fluorescence and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopies, measured up to 2.1 GPa in a diamond anvil cell on single crystals, are in excellent agreement, correlating linker rotation with modulation of emission. Topologically isolating the 1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethynylbenzoate) units within a MOF facilitates concurrent structural and spectroscopic study in the absence of intermolecular perturbation, allowing characterisation of the luminescence properties of a high&#8208;energy, twisted conformation of the previously well&#8208;studied chromophore. We expect the unique environment provided by network solids, and the capability of combining crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis, will greatly enhance understanding of luminescent molecules and lead to the development of novel sensors and adsorbents.</dc:description>

      <title>Double Gyroid Nanostructure Formation by Aggregation&#8208;Induced Atropisomerization and Co&#8208;Assembly of Ionic Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Amphiphiles</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report a new molecular design principle for creating double gyroid nanostructured molecular assemblies based on atropisomerization. Ionic amphiphiles containing two imidazolium rings in close proximity to one another were designed and synthesized. NMR data revealed that the rotation of the imidazolium rings is restricted, with an activation energy as high as 63 kJ mol  &#8211;1  in DMSO&#8208;  d  6  solution. DFT calculations predicted an activation energy of 90&#8211;100 kJ mol  &#8211;1  in vacuum for a model compound. Due to the restricted rotation, the amphiphiles feature &#8220;double&#8221; atropisomeric axes in their ionic segments and form three stable atropisomers, namely: meso,  R  and  S  . We found that these isomers co&#8208;organize into  Ia Common.EditSubmissionSteps.Transform.EquationText d  &#8208;type bicontinuous cubic liquid&#8208;crystalline mesophases through nanosegregation of the ionic and non&#8208;ionic parts, respectively.

      <title>Total Synthesis of the Cyclic Depsipeptide Vioprolide D via its (Z)&#8208;Diastereoisomer</title>
      <dc:description>The first total synthesis of vioprolide D was accomplished in an overall yield of 2.0% starting from methyl (2S)&#8208;3&#8208;benzyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#173;propanoate (16 steps in the longest linear sequence). The cyclic depsipeptide was assembled from two building blocks of similar size and complexity in a modular, highly convergent approach. Peptide bond formation at the C&#8208;terminal dehydrobutyrine amino acid of the Northern fragment was possible via its (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer. After macrolactamization and formation of the thiazoline ring, the (Z)&#8208;double bond of the dehydrobutyrine unit was isomerized to the (E)&#8208;double bond of the natural product. The cytotoxicity of vioprolide D is significantly higher than that of its (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer.</dc:description>

      <title>Modelling Photosynthesis with Zn(II)&#8208;Protoporphyrin all&#8208;DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex/Aptamer Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;DNA scaffolds act as templates for the organization of photosystem I (PS I) model systems. A series of DNA templates composed of Zn(II)&#8208;protoporphyrin IX (Zn(II)PPIX)&#8208;functionalized G&#8208;quadruplex conjugated to the 3  '  &#8208; or 5  '  &#8208;end of the tyrosinamide (TA) aptamer and Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to the 3  '  &#8208; and 5  '  &#8208;ends of the tyrosinamide aptamer through a four&#8208;thymidine (4&#215;T) bridge, structures I to IV. Effective photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex to bipyridinium functionalized tyrosinamide, TA&#8208;MV  2+  , bound to the TA aptamer units is demonstrated. The order of photosensitized ET quenching in the photosystems is III &gt; IV &gt; I &gt; II and follows the binding affinities of TA&#8208;MV  2+  to the aptamer units. The effectiveness of the primary ET quenching of Zn(II)PPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex by TA&#8208;MV  2+  controls the efficiency of the generation of TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  , under steady&#8208;state illumination, in the presence of 2&#8208;mercaptoethanol as sacrificial electron donor. The photosystem&#8208;controlled formation of TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  by the different photosystems dictates the secondary activation of the ET cascade corresponding to the ferredoxin&#8208;NADP  +  reductase, FNR, catalysed reduction of NADP  +  to NADPH by TA&#8208;MV  +&#8226;  , and the sequestered alcohol dehydrogenase catalysed reduction of acetophenone to 1&#8208;phenylethanol by NADPH. The photosensitizer&#8208;aptamer conjugates reveal switchable &#8220;ON&#8221;/&#8220;OFF&#8221; photoactivities.

      <title>Solvent Molecule Cooperation Enhancing Lithium Metal Battery Performance at Both Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A good mix: In an ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;ethylene sulfite (ES) mixed electrolyte, EC dominates the solvation sheath of Li+ and mitigates side reactions on both electrodes and ES introduces sulfur&#8208;containing species at the solid electrolyte interphase on the Li metal anode. Taken together the components of the electrolyte solvent enable efficient and stable cycling of Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing electrolytes compatible with efficient and reversible cycling of electrodes is critical to the success of rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs). The Coulombic efficiencies and cycle lives of LMBs with ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate, ethylene sulfite (ES), and their combinations as electrolyte solvents show that in a binary&#8208;solvent electrolyte the extent of electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface is dependent on the solvent component that dominates the solvation sheath of Li+. This knowledge led to the development of an EC&#8208;ES electrolyte exhibiting high performance for Li||LiFePO4 batteries. Carbonate molecules occupy the solvation sheath and improve the Coulombic efficiencies of both the anode and cathode. Sulfite molecules lead to desirable morphology and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase and extend the cycle life of the Li metal anode. The cooperation between these components provides a new example of electrolyte optimization for improved LMBs.

      <title>In situ Synthesis of Biomimetic Silica Nanofibrous Aerogels with Temperature&#8208;Invariant Superelasticity over One Million Compressions</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic aerogels are fabricated by combining flexible electrospun silica nanofibers and rubber&#8208;like Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si networks via an in situ synthesis strategy. The aerogels exhibit temperature&#8208;invariant superelasticity, fire resistance, and ultralow thermal conductivity, which make them promising thermal insulation materials for extreme environments.







Abstract
Resilient and compressible three&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials comprising polymers, carbon, and metals have been prepared in diverse forms. However, the creation of thermostable elastic ceramic aerogels remains an enormous challenge. We demonstrate an in&#8197;situ synthesis strategy to develop biomimetic silica nanofibrous (SNF) aerogels with superelasticity by integrating flexible electrospun silica nanofibers and rubber&#8208;like Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonding networks. The stable bonding structure among nanofibers is in&#8197;situ constructed along with a fibrous freeze&#8208;shaping process. The resultant SNF aerogels exhibit integrated properties of ultralow density (&gt;0.25&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3), temperature&#8208;invariant superelasticity up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, and robust fatigue resistance over one million compressions. The ceramic nature also endows the aerogels with fire resistance and ultralow thermal conductivity. The successful synthesis of the SNF aerogels opens new pathways for the design of superelastic ceramic aerogels in a structurally adaptive and scalable form.

Abstract
Voltage decay and capacity fading are the main challenges for the commercialization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs). Now, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment is designed via the pyrolysis of urea to improve the voltage and capacity stability of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 (LMNO), by which oxygen vacancies, spinel phase integration, and N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayers are synchronously built on the surface of LMNO microspheres. Oxygen vacancies and spinel phase integration suppress irreversible O2 release and help lithium ion diffusion, while N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayer mitigates the corrosion of electrolyte with excellent conductivity. The electrochemical performance of LMNO after the treatment improves significantly; the capacity retention rate after 500 cycles at 1&#8201;C is still as high as 89.9&#8201;% with a very small voltage fading rate of 1.09&#8197;mV&#8201;cycle&#8722;1. This three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment strategy can suppress the voltage decay and capacity fading of LLOs.

Enzymatic umpolung of formic acid, the active ingredient of ant venom, enables nucleophilic one&#8208;carbon extensions. Oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase generates a &#8220;nucleophilic formic acid intermediate&#8221;, which can be condensed with aldehydes.

&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic umpolung of formic acid, the active ingredient of ant venom, enables nucleophilic one&#8208;carbon extensions. Oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase generates a &#8220;nucleophilic formic acid intermediate&#8221;, which can be condensed with aldehydes. A cascade of engineered oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase, an oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase, and a thioesterase allows the continuous one&#8208;pot synthesis of various chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids from oxalic acid and aldehydes in high &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, as reported by S. Burgener, N.&#8197;S. Cortina, and T.&#8197;J. Erb in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20191515510.1002/anie.201915155&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Mercaptothiacalixarenes Steer 24 Copper(I) Centers to form a Hollow&#8208;Sphere Structure Featuring Cu2S2 Motifs with Exceptionally Short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu Distances</title>
      <dc:description>
A cluster with a CuI24S48 nanocage can be accessed in high yields using mercaptothiacalixarenes as directing ligands. The structure contains 12 Cu2S2 diamond core building blocks featuring exceptionally short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu distances.

Abstract
Tetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene (LH4) can be used as a coordination platform to bind four CuI ions at the thiolate and thioether S atoms. Donor ligands such as phosphanes can stabilize the resulting [LCu4] units, which then remain monomeric ([(Ph3PCu)4L]). In the absence of donor ligands, they aggregate, providing a hexamer ([LCu4]6) in high yields, with a hollow&#8208;sphere structure formed by an unprecedented Cu24S48 cage that is surrounded by the organic framework of the calixarene chalices. Preliminary NMR experiments with regard to the host&#8208;guest chemistry in solution showed that the compound represents a polytopic host for acetonitrile and methane.

      <title>Formation and Characterization of a BeOBeC Multiple Radical Featuring a Quartet Carbyne Moiety</title>
      <dc:description>
The BeOBeC multiple radical features a quartet carbyne moiety, and thus represents the first carbyne radical to have a quartet ground state with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center.







Abstract
Through reaction of beryllium dimers with carbon monoxide, a carbonyl complex BeBeCO is formed in solid neon. Upon visible light excitation, the BeBeCO complex rearranges to a BeCOBe isomer, which further isomerizes to a low&#8208;energy BeOBeC species under UV&#8208;visible light excitation. These species are identified on the basis of infrared absorption spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical studies. The BeOBeC molecule is characterized to be a multiple radical species having an electronic quintet ground state featuring an unusual quartet carbyne unit with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center. Bonding analysis indicates that the strong Pauli repulsion between carbon 2s lone pair electrons and the &#963; electrons of the BeOBe fragment significantly weakens the Be&#8722;C bonding and destabilizes the triplet state of the BeOBeC radical with a doublet carbyne unit. The three&#8208;center &#960;&#8208;bonding of BeOBe is also found to play a role in stabilizing the quartet carbyne.

      <title>How Nano&#8208;Ions Act Like Ionic Surfactants</title>
      <dc:description>
Free of charge: Inorganic nano&#8208;ions were found to act like (organic) ionic surfactants when added to dilute solutions of non&#8208;ionic surfactants, inducing spontaneous vesicle formation by adsorption and thus electrically charging the non&#8208;ionic lamellar phase. Although they are fundamentally different, nano&#8208;ions can serve as alternatives to ionic surfactants.







Abstract
Recently, nanometric ions were shown to adsorb to hydrated neutral surfaces and to bind to the cavities of macrocyclic molecules with an unexpectedly strong affinity arising from a solvent&#8208;mediated effect named superchaotropicity. We show here that nano&#8208;ions at low concentrations (&#956;m range), similarly to anionic surfactants, induce the spontaneous transformation of a swollen lyotropic lamellar phase of non&#8208;ionic surfactant into a vesicle phase. This transition occurs when the neutral lamellae acquire charges, either by adsorption of the nano&#8208;ions onto, or by anchoring of the ionic surfactant into the lamellae. In contrast to ionic surfactants, nano&#8208;ions strongly dehydrate the neutral surfactant assemblies. As a conclusion, these purely inorganic nanometric ions act as alternatives to the widely used organic ionic surfactants.

      <title>Elucidating Noncovalent Reaction Mechanisms: Identification of the G&#8208;Quartet as an Intermediate in G&#8208;Quadruplex Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>In analogy to covalent reactions, the understanding of noncovalent association pathways is fundamental to influence and control any supramolecular process. Following an approach that is reminiscent of covalent methodologies, we study here, for the first time, the mechanism of G&#8208;quadruplex formation in organic solvents. Our results support a reaction pathway in which the cation shifts first the equilibrium towards a G&#8208;quartet transient intermediate, which then acts as a template in the formation of the G&#8208;quadruplex product.</dc:description>

      <title>Raman Optical Activity (ROA) as a New Tool to Elucidate the Helical Structure of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
      <dc:description>Poly(phenylacetylene)s is a family of helical polymers constituted by conjugated double bonds that are fixed into specific helical structures due to supramolecular and/or steric interactions among pendant groups. Raman spectra of these polymers show a structural fingerprint of the polyene backbone which, in combination with its helical orientation, makes them great candidates to study their helical structure by Raman Optical Activity (ROA). Four different well&#8208;known poly(phenylacetylene)s adopting different scaffolds and ten different helical senses have been prepared. For all of these, Raman and ROA spectra were recorded which allows us to establish ROA spectrum/helical sense relationships: a right&#8208;handed orientation of the polyene backbone (P  helix  ) produces a triplet of negative ROA bands, whereas a M  helix  produces a positive triplet ROA pattern. &#160;Raman and ROA spectra of each polymer exhibited the same profile and the sign of the ROA spectrum was opposite to the lowest energy ECD band, thus indicating a resonance effect. Resonance ROA appears then as a useful selective indicator of the helical sense of poly(phenylacetylene)s, especially for those showing an extra Cotton band in the ECD spectrum. In these cases, a wrong helical sense is assigned based on ECD, while ROA alerts of this misassignment.</dc:description>

      <title>On&#8208;surface assembly of hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular graphyne&#8208;like networks</title>
      <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface assembly of graphyne&#8208;related two&#8208; dimensional (2D) materials is directive for the long&#8208;awaited reliable synthesis of the carbon allotrope graphyne. Some of the challenges in the graphyne synthesis is the control of the alkyne coupling reaction on metal surfaces and the fabrication of single&#8208;layered materials in solution&#8208;based methods. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular approach to fabricate highly ordered monolayered hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonded graphyne&#8208;like 2D materials from triethynyltriazine derivatives on Au(111) and Ag(111). The 2D networks are stabilized by N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8722;C(  sp  )&#8208;bonds and N&#183;&#183;&#183;Br&#8722;C(  sp  )&#8208;bonds to the triazine core, respectively. The structural properties and the binding energies of the supramolecular graphynes have been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density&#8208;functional theory calculations. It is revealed that the  N&#183;&#183;&#183;Br&#8722;C(  sp  )  &#8208;bonds lead to significantly stronger bonded networks compared to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. A systematic analysis of the binding energies of triethynyltriazine and triethynylbenzene derivatives further demonstrates that the X  3  &#8208;synthon, which is commonly observed for bromobenzene derivatives, is weaker than the X  6  &#8208;synthon for our bromotriethynyl derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Activatable Polymeric Reporter For Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Imaging of Invasive Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Discriminative detection of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers is crucial for their effective treatment and prognosis. However, activatable probes able to do so  in vivo  have been rarely developed. We herein report an activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) that specifically turns on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and photoacoustic (PA) signals in response to the urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) overexpressed by invasive breast cancer. P&#8208;Dex has a renal&#8208;clearable dextran backbone which is linked with a NIR dye caged with an uPA&#8208;cleavable peptide substrate. Such a molecular design allows P&#8208;Dex to passive target tumors, activate NIR fluorescence and PA signals to effectively distinguish invasive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer from noninvasive MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to minimize the toxicity potential.

      <title>Interfacial design of dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have been developed rapidly recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their low cost and high safety. The research on suppressing zinc dendrite growth has meanwhile attracted widespread attention in order to improve the lifespan and reversibility of batteries. Herein, design methods for dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes and their internal mechanisms are reviewed from the perspective of optimizing host&#8211;zinc interface and zinc&#8211;electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we propose a design strategy to homogenize zinc deposition by regulating the interfacial electric field and ion distribution during zinc nucleation and growth. This Minireview can offer potential directions for the rational design of dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes employed in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have been developed rapidly recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their low cost and high safety. The research on suppressing zinc dendrite growth has meanwhile attracted widespread attention in order to improve the lifespan and reversibility of batteries. Herein, design methods for dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes and their internal mechanisms are reviewed from the perspective of optimizing host&#8211;zinc interface and zinc&#8211;electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we propose a design strategy to homogenize zinc deposition by regulating the interfacial electric field and ion distribution during zinc nucleation and growth. This Minireview can offer potential directions for the rational design of dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes employed in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Assemblies Enable Mitochondria Localization of Histone H2B in Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: It is known that a highly dynamic communication among subcellular organelles (e.g., cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and nucleus) dictate cellular behaviors. But little information exists on how the inter&#8208;organelle crosstalk impacts cancer cells due to the lack of approaches that manipulate inter&#8208;organelle communication in cancer cells. We unexpectedly found that a negatively charged, enzyme cleavable peptide enables the trafficking of histone protein (H2B), a nuclear protein, to the mitochondria in cancer cells. The peptide, denoted as MitoFlag,

interacts with the nuclear location sequence (NLS) of H2B to block it entering nucleus. A protease on the mitochondria cleaves the Flag from the complex of MitoFlag and H2B to form assemblies that retain H2B on the mitochondria and facilitate the H2B entering mitochondria. Molecular validation of MitoFlag shows that adding NLS, replacing aspartic acid residues by glutamic acid residues, or changing L&#8208;aspartic acid to D&#8208;aspartic residue abolishes the trafficking of H2B into mitochondria of HeLa cells. As the first example of enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) of a synthetic peptide for trafficking endogenous proteins, this work provides insights for understanding and manipulating inter&#8208;organelle communication in cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Dinuclear Metal&#8208;ProPhenol Catalysts: Development and Synthetic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Dinuclear metal&#8208;ProPhenol complexes are versatile catalysts that have been used to facilitate a broad range of asymmetric transformations, including aldol, Mannich, Henry reactions, alkynylation and conjugation additions. Moreover, many of the reported processes have been directly employed in the syntheses of natural products and other biologically active molecules.







Abstract
The ProPhenol ligand is a member of the chiral aza&#8208;crown family that spontaneously forms a bimetallic complex upon treatment with alkyl metal reagents, such as Et2Zn and Bu2Mg. The resulting complex features Lewis acidic and Br&#248;nsted basic sites, enabling simultaneous activation of both nucleophile and electrophile in the same chiral environment. Since the initial report in 2000, metal&#8208;ProPhenol catalysts have been used to facilitate a broad range of asymmetric transformations, including aldol, Mannich, and Henry reactions, as well as alkynylations and conjugation additions. By promoting such a diverse array of reactions, these complexes provide rapid and atom&#8208;economical access to valuable complex building blocks. In this Review, we describe in detail the development and synthetic applications of these versatile catalysts with a special focus on recent efforts to improve reactivity and selectivity through ligand design and structural modification.

      <title>Reversible and Selective CO2 to HCO2&#8722; Electrocatalysis near the Thermodynamic Potential</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversible CO2 to HCO2&#8722; conversion is catalyzed by using Pt(depe)2][PF6]2 as an electrocatalyst (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane). High&#8208; and low&#8208;energy intermediates are avoided by considering the thermodynamic driving force for each step.







Abstract
Reversible catalysis is a hallmark of energy&#8208;efficient chemical transformations, but can only be achieved if the changes in free energy of intermediate steps are minimized and the catalytic cycle is devoid of high transition&#8208;state barriers. Using these criteria, we demonstrate reversible CO2/HCO2&#8722; conversion catalyzed by [Pt(depe)2]2+ (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane). Direct measurement of the free energies associated with each catalytic step correctly predicts a slight bias towards CO2 reduction. We demonstrate how the experimentally measured free energy of each step directly contributes to the &lt;50&#8197;mV overpotential. We also find that for CO2 reduction, H2 evolution is negligible and the Faradaic efficiency for HCO2&#8722; production is nearly quantitative. A free&#8208;energy analysis reveals H2 evolution is endergonic, providing a thermodynamic basis for highly selective CO2 reduction.

      <title>Versatile Fluorescent Probes for Imaging the Superoxide Anion in Living Cells and In&#8197;Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
Super probes for superoxide: Recent developments in the imaging of the superoxide anion in living cells and in&#8197;vivo with versatile fluorescent probes are discussed in depth in this Minireview. An emphasis is placed on the design strategies for these probes, thereby providing guidelines for the potential study of the superoxide anion.







Abstract
The superoxide anion (O2.&#8722;) is widely engaged in the regulation of cell functions and is thereby intimately associated with the onset and progression of many diseases. To ascertain the pathological roles of O2.&#8722; in related diseases, developing effective methods for monitoring O2.&#8722; in biological systems is essential. Fluorescence imaging is a powerful tool for monitoring bioactive molecules in cells and in&#8197;vivo owing to its high sensitivity and high temporal&#8208;spatial resolution. Therefore, increasing numbers of fluorescent imaging probes have been constructed to monitor O2.&#8722; inside live cells and small animals. In this minireview, we summarize the methods for design and application of O2.&#8722;&#8208;responsive fluorescent probes. Moreover, we present the challenges for detecting O2.&#8722; and suggestions for constructing new fluorescent probes that can indicate the production sites and concentration changes in O2.&#8722; as well as O2.&#8722;&#8208;associated active molecules in living cells and in&#8197;vivo.

A macromolecular reporter whose near&#8208;infrared fluorescence is activated by a bladder cancer biomarker is reported by K. Pu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;4415. The reporter undergoes efficient renal clearance and accumulates in the bladder, enabling both the real&#8208;time in&#8197;vivo imaging of bladder cancer and in&#8197;vitro urinalysis for tracking tumor progression in living mice.

      <title>Alkyl&#8208;Chain&#8208;Regulated Charge Transfer in Fluorescent Inorganic CsPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Chain gang: Regulating the alkyl&#8208;chain length of quantum dots attached to inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites maximizes charge extraction and transfer at the perovskite/carbon interface. The optimized inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell (PSC) with C12 alkyl chain QDs yields an efficiency of up to 10.85&#8201;%.







Abstract
Improved charge extraction and wide spectral absorption promote power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;based CsPbBr3 PSCs have an inferior power output capacity because of the large optical band gap of the perovskite film and the high energy barrier at perovskite/carbon interface. Herein, we use alkyl&#8208;chain regulated quantum dots as hole&#8208;conductors to reduce charge recombination. By precisely controlling alkyl&#8208;chain length of ligands, a balance between the surface dipole induced charge coulomb repulsive force and quantum tunneling distance is achieved to maximize charge extraction. A fluorescent carbon electrode is used as a cathode to harvest the unabsorbed incident light and to emit fluorescent light at 516&#8197;nm for re&#8208;absorption by the perovskite film. The optimized PSC free of encapsulation achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency up to 10.85&#8201;% with nearly unchanged photovoltaic performances under 80&#8201;%RH, 80&#8201;&#176;C, or light irradiation in air.

      <title>Rapid One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Compaction of High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Mg3Sb2 Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;step approach is developed for preparing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type (Sc, Te)&#8208;doped Mg3Sb2 thermoelectric materials that show a high optimal thermoelectric figure of merit zT of about 1.5 and a high average zT of about 0.9 at 300&#8211;725&#8197;K. The approach provides a new avenue for the rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 thermoelectrics.







Abstract
n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8208;based compounds have emerged as a promising class of low&#8208;cost thermoelectric materials due to their extraordinary performance at low and intermediate temperatures. However, so far, high thermoelectric performance has merely been reported in n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8208;Mg3Bi2 alloys with a large amount of Bi. Moreover, current synthesis methods of n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 bulk thermoelectrics involve multi&#8208;step processes that are time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming. Herein, we report a fast and straightforward approach to fabricate n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 thermoelectrics using spark plasma sintering, which combines the synthesis and compaction in one step. Using this method, we achieve a high thermoelectric figure of merit zT of about 0.4&#8211;1.5 at 300&#8211;725&#8197;K in n&#8208;type (Sc, Te)&#8208;co&#8208;doped Mg3Sb2 without alloying with Mg3Bi2. In comparison with the currently reported synthesis methods, the complexity, process time, and cost of our method are significantly reduced. This work demonstrates a simple, low&#8208;cost route for the potential large&#8208;scale production of n&#8208;type Mg3Sb2 thermoelectrics.

      <title>Fluorophore&#8208;Promoted RNA Folding and Photostability Enables Imaging of Single Broccoli&#8208;Tagged mRNAs in Live Mammalian Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Spinach and Broccoli are fluorogenic RNA aptamers that bind DFHBI, a mimic of the GFP chromophore, and activate its fluorescence. Computational screening led to the development of BI, a DFHBI derivative that binds Broccoli with higher affinity. BI promotes Broccoli folding and the resulting Broccoli&#8208;BI complexes exhibit markedly higher fluorescence and photostability. These improvements enable imaging of Broccoli&#8208;tagged single mRNA transcripts in live mammalian cells for the first time.







Abstract
Spinach and Broccoli are fluorogenic RNA aptamers that bind DFHBI, a mimic of the chromophore in green fluorescent protein, and activate its fluorescence. Spinach/Broccoli&#8208;DFHBI complexes exhibit high fluorescence in vitro, but they exhibit lower fluorescence in mammalian cells. Here, computational screening was used to identify BI, a DFHBI derivative that binds Broccoli with higher affinity and leads to markedly higher fluorescence in cells compared to previous ligands. BI prevents thermal unfolding of Broccoli at 37&#8201;&#176;C, leading to more folded Broccoli and thus more fluorescent Broccoli&#8208;BI complexes in cells. Broccoli&#8208;BI complexes are more photostable owing to impaired photoisomerization and rapid unbinding of photoisomerized cis&#8208;BI. These properties enable single mRNA containing 24 Broccoli aptamers to be imaged in live mammalian cells treated with BI. Small molecule ligands can thus promote RNA folding in cells, and thus allow single mRNA imaging with fluorogenic aptamers.

      <title>A Multidirectional Superelastic Organic Crystal by Versatile Ferroelastical Manipulation</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend into shape: A single crystal of 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)urea has been shown to demonstrate superelasticity (SE) in one direction and ferroelasticity (FE) in two other directions as a result of mechanical twinning. The crystal underwent stepwise twinning and ferroelastically formed various shapes with multiple domains oriented in different directions, which resulted in the crystal showing superelasticity in multiple directions.







Abstract
Mechanical twinning changes atomic, molecular, and crystal orientations along with directions of the anisotropic properties of the crystalline materials while maintaining single crystallinity in each domain. However, such deformability has been less studied in brittle organic crystals despite their remarkable anisotropic functions. Herein we demonstrate a direction&#8208;dependent mechanical twinning that shows superelasticity in one direction and ferroelasticity in two other directions in a single crystal of 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)urea. The crystal can undergo stepwise twinning and ferroelastically forms various shapes with multiple domains oriented in different directions, thereby affording a crystal that shows superelasticity in multiple directions. This adaptability and shape recoverability in a ferroelastic and superelastic single crystal under ambient conditions are of great importance in future applications of organic crystals as mechanical materials, such as in soft robotics.

      <title>Back Cover: Fusion of Different Crosslinked Polymers Based on Dynamic Disulfide Exchange (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 11/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Fusion of two cross&#8208;linked polymers (CLPs) via a dynamic linker, bis(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)disulfide (BiTEMPS), at the interface is demonstrated. In their Communication on page&#8197;4294, H. Otsuka et&#8197;al. demonstrate how the fusion was carried out by simply mixing and hot&#8208;pressing powdered CLPs that contain BiTEMPS units. The appearance, swelling behavior, and mechanical properties of the fused samples were investigated.

      <title>Cover Picture: Hydroxide Is Not a Promoter of C2+ Product Formation in the Electrochemical Reduction of CO on Copper (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 11/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The electroreduction of CO strongly depends on the nature and concentration of the electrolyte cations. In their Research Article on page&#8197;4464, B. Xu, Q. Lu, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that high concentrations of the cation (Na+), rather than OH&#8722;, are the predominant factor affecting the formation of C2+ products. The conclusions are supported by experiments in which a fraction or all of the Na+ ions were chelated by a crown ether. The chelated Na+ ion is depicted as a planetary system.
