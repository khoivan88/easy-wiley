      <title>Tuning the hybridization of local exciton and charge&#8208;transfer states in highly efficient organic photovoltaic cells</title>
      <dc:description>Decreasing the energy loss is one of the most feasible ways to improve the efficiencies of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Recent studies have suggested that non&#8208;radiative energy loss is the dominant factor that hinders further improvements in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPV cells. However, there is no rational molecular design strategy for OPV materials with suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss. In this work, taking molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a quantitative parameter, we establish a general relationship between chemical structure and intermolecular interactions. The results reveal that increasing the ESP difference between donor and acceptor will enhance the intermolecular interaction. In the OPV cells, the enhanced intermolecular interaction will increase the charge transfer state ratio in its hybridization with local exciton to facilitate the charge generation but simultaneously result in a larger non&#8208;radiative energy loss. These results suggest that finely tuning the ESP of OPV materials is a feasible method to further improve the efficiencies of OPV cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Squaramides and Ureas: A Flexible Approach to Polymerase&#8208;Compatible Nucleic Acid Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Joining oligonucleotides together (ligation) is a powerful means of retrieving information at the nanoscale. In order to recover this information, the linkages created must be compatible with polymerase enzymes. However, enzymatic ligation is restrictive and current chemical ligation methods lack flexibility.

      <dc:description>Development of nanoparticle based biomedical applications has been hampered due to undesired off&#8208;target effects. Here we outline a set of cellular AND gate concepts to enhance selectivity, where a nanoassembly&#8208;cell interaction is turned on, only in the concurrent presence of a two different protein functions, an enzymatic reaction (ALP) and a ligand&#8208;protein (CA IX) binding event.

      <title>Exploring the Limits of Transition Metal Fluorination at High Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorination is a proven method for challenging the limits of chemistry, both structurally and electronically.

The valence expansion of Os and Ir enable ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal F 2p &#8594; M 6p charge transfer that strengthens M&#8208;F bonds and decreases the overall bond polarity. The lower stability of IrF8, and the instability of PtF8&#160;and several other compounds below 300 GPa, is here explained by the occupation of M&#8208;F antibonding levels in octafluorides with a metal valence electron count exceeding 8.</dc:description>

      <title>Biosynthetically Inspired Syntheses of Secu&#8242;amamine A and Fluvirosaones A and B</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosynthetically inspiring: A vanadium&#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction of (viro)allosecurinine N&#8208;oxides afforded the key pluripotent enamine precursors that were further transformed into secu&#8242;amamine A and fluvirosaones A and B. The key steps of the transformations were biomimetic 1,2&#8208;amine shifts and/or formal [3+2] cycloadditions of the enamine.







Abstract
Presented here is a concise synthesis of secu&#8242;amamine A, and fluvirosaones A and B from readily available allosecurinine and viroallosecurinine. The key C2&#8208;enamine derivative of (viro)allosecurinine, the presumed biosynthetic precursors of these natural products, was accessed, for the first time, by a VO(acac)2&#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biosynthetically inspiring&lt;/b&gt;: A vanadium&#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction of (viro)allosecurinine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxides afforded the key pluripotent enamine precursors that were further transformed into secu&#8242;amamine A and fluvirosaones A and B. The key steps of the transformations were biomimetic 1,2&#8208;amine shifts and/or formal [3+2] cycloadditions of the enamine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented here is a concise synthesis of secu&#8242;amamine A, and fluvirosaones A and B from readily available allosecurinine and viroallosecurinine. The key C2&#8208;enamine derivative of (viro)allosecurinine, the presumed biosynthetic precursors of these natural products, was accessed, for the first time, by a VO(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;mediated regioselective Polonovski reaction. Formal hydration and 1,2&#8208;amine shift of this pluripotent enamine compound afforded secu&#8242;amamine A. Formal oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between this enamine and TMS&#8208;substituted methallyl iodide reagent paved the way to the precursors of fluvirosaones A and B. The relative stereochemistry at the C2 position of these advanced intermediates governs the fate of 1,2&#8208;amine shift leading to fluvirosaones A and B. The syntheses of potential biosynthetic precursors and investigations of their chemical reactivities have provided insights regarding the biogenesis of these natural products.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of an Atomic Nickel Co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2 for Improved Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomic nickel: A facile molten&#8208;salt method is used to prepare an atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2. This system has photocatalytic H2 evolution activity that is four times higher than that of Ni nanoparticles on TiO2.







Abstract
Atomic co&#8208;catalysts offer high potential to improve the photocatalytic performance, of which the preparation with earth&#8208;abundant elements is challenging. Here, a new molten salt method (MSM) is designed to prepare atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst on widely studied TiO2 nanoparticles. The liquid environment and space confinement effect of the molten salt leads to atomic dispersion of Ni ions on TiO2, while the strong polarizing force provided by the molten salt promotes formation of strong Ni&#8722;O bonds. Interestingly, Ni atoms are found to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies (OV) on TiO2 during the MSM process, which benefits the charge transfer and hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergy of atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst and OV results in 4&#8208;time increase in H2 evolution rate compared to that of the Ni co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2 prepared by an impregnation method. This work provides a new strategy of controlling atomic co&#8208;catalyst together with defects for efficient photocatalytic water splitting.

      <title>Electron Configuration Modulation of Nickel Single Atoms for Elevated Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
The high catalytic activity of metal single atoms originates from their unique electronic configuration. By finely tuning the oxidation states of metal single atoms, their electronic configurations were modulated, resulting in more unpaired d&#8208;orbital electrons and a markedly elevated photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The emerging metal single&#8208;atom catalyst has aroused extensive attention in multiple fields, such as clean energy, environmental protection, and biomedicine. Unfortunately, though it has been shown to be highly active, the origins of the activity of the single&#8208;atom sites remain unrevealed to date owing to the lack of deep insight on electronic level. Now, partially oxidized Ni single&#8208;atom sites were constructed in polymeric carbon nitride (CN), which elevates the photocatalytic performance by over 30&#8208;fold. The 3d orbital of the partially oxidized Ni single&#8208;atom sites is filled with unpaired d&#8208;electrons, which are ready to be excited under irradiation. Such an electron configuration results in elevated light response, conductivity, charge separation, and mobility of the photocatalyst concurrently, thus largely augmenting the photocatalytic performance.

      <title>Extending Carrier Lifetimes in Lead Halide Perovskites with Alkali Metals by Passivating and Eliminating Halide Interstitial Defects</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkalis passivate iodine interstitial defects in lead perovskites, eliminate the mid&#8208;gap states, and suppress the nonradiative recombination. Theoretical guidelines are developed for defect inactivation in perovskite solar cells and other devices.







Abstract
Defects, such as halide interstitials, act as charge recombination centers, induce degradation of halide perovskites, and create major obstacles to applications of these materials. Alkali metal dopants greatly improve perovskite performance. Using ab&#8197;initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, it is demonstrated that alkalis bring favorable effects. The formation energy of halide interstitials increases by up to a factor of four in the presence of alkali dopants, and therefore, defect concentration decreases. When defects are present, alkali metals strongly bind to them. Halide interstitials introduce mid&#8208;gap states that rapidly trap charge carriers. Alkalis eliminate the trap states, helping to maintain high current density. Further to charge trapping, the interstitials accelerate charge recombination. By passivating the interstitials, alkalis make carrier lifetimes up to seven times longer than in defect&#8208;free perovskites and up to thirty times longer than in defective perovskites.

      <title>Homogeneous, Low&#8208;volume, Efficient, and Sensitive Quantitation of Circulating Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 for Cancer Diagnosis and Immunotherapy Response Prediction</title>
      <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;induced thermophoresis quantitation of exosomal programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1, a transmembrane protein) was developed, which integrates effective recognition of aptamer and homogeneous thermophoresis.

Translation of the method into standard clinical practice for immunotherapy prediction and monitoring is anticipated.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but its efficacy is severely hindered by the lack of effective predictors. Herein, we developed a homogeneous, low&#8208;volume, efficient, and sensitive exosomal programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1, a type of transmembrane protein) quantitation method for cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy response prediction (HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1). The method combines a newly evolved aptamer that efficiently binds to PD&#8208;L1 with less hindrance by antigen glycosylation than antibody, and homogeneous thermophoresis with a rapid binding kinetic. As a result, HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 is higher in sensitivity, more rapid in reaction time, and easier to operate than existing enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;based methods. As a consequence of an outstanding improvement of sensitivity, the level of circulating exosomal PD&#8208;L1 detected by HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 can effectively distinguish cancer patients from healthy volunteers, and for the first time was found to correlate positively with the metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Overall, HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 brings a fresh approach to exosomal PD&#8208;L1 quantitation, offering unprecedented potential for early cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy response prediction.

      <title>In Situ Reconstruction of a Hierarchical Sn&#8208;Cu/SnOx Core/Shell Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A Sn/SnOx interface reconstructed in&#8197;situ facilitates formic acid production by optimizing the binding of the reaction intermediate HCOO* while promotes Faradaic efficiency of C1 products by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. This results in high Faradaic efficiency, current density, and stability of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to give C1 (formate and CO) products is one of the most techno&#8208;economically achievable strategies for alleviating CO2 emissions. Now, it is demonstrated that the SnOx shell in Sn2.7Cu catalyst with a hierarchical Sn&#8208;Cu core can be reconstructed in&#8197;situ under cathodic potentials of CO2RR. The resulting Sn2.7Cu catalyst achieves a high current density of 406.7&#177;14.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with C1 Faradaic efficiency of 98.0&#177;0.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.70&#8197;V vs. RHE, and remains stable at 243.1&#177;19.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a C1 Faradaic efficiency of 99.0&#177;0.5&#8201;% for 40&#8197;h at &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. RHE. DFT calculations indicate that the reconstructed Sn/SnOx interface facilitates formic acid production by optimizing binding of the reaction intermediate HCOO* while promotes Faradaic efficiency of C1 products by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in high Faradaic efficiency, current density, and stability of CO2RR at low overpotentials.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Organic Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Circularly polarized organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) of small molecules is realized by direct bonding of achiral carbazole to a chiral ester chain for efficient chirality transfer and molecular packing arrangement upon photo&#8208;activation. The photo&#8208;activated CP&#8208;OURTP can be facilely deactivated by thermal treatment for stimuli&#8208;responsive reversible CP&#8208;OURTP with high photo/thermal stabilities.







Abstract
Purely organic materials showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and ultralong RTP (OURTP) have recently attracted much attention. However, it is challenging to integrate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) into RTP/OURTP. Here, we show a strategy to realize CPL&#8208;active OURTP (CP&#8208;OURTP) by binding an achiral phosphor group directly to the chiral center of an ester chain. Engineering of this flexible chiral chain enables efficient chirality transfer to carbazole aggregates, resulting in strong CP&#8208;OURTP with a lifetime of over 0.6&#8197;s and dissymmetry factor of 2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 after the conformation regulation upon photo&#8208;activation. The realized CP&#8208;OURTP is thus stable at room temperature but can be deactivated quickly at 50&#8201;&#176;C to CP&#8208;RTP with high CPL stability during the photo&#8208;activation/thermal&#8208;deactivation cycles. Based on this extraordinary photo/thermal&#8208;responsive and highly reversible CP&#8208;OURTP/RTP, a CPL&#8208;featured lifetime&#8208;encrypted combinational logic device has been successfully established.

      <title>Affecting an Ultra&#8208;High Work Function of Silver</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high increase in the work function (WF) of silver, from 4.26 to 7.42&#8197;eV, by 3D dual&#8208;entrapment of the WF modifying components l&#8208;cysteine and Zn(OH)2 within the metal is reported. The WF enhancement mechanism is based on directly affecting the charge transfer ability of the metal, separately by cysteine and hydrolyzed zinc(II), and synergistically by the combination of the two, through the known Zn&#8208;cysteine finger redox trap effect.







Abstract
An ultra&#8208;high increase in the WF of silver, from 4.26 to 7.42&#8197;eV, that is, an increase of up to circa 3.1&#8197;eV is reported. This is the highest WF increase on record for metals and is supported by recent computational studies which predict the potential ability to affect an increase of the WF of metals by more than 4&#8197;eV. We achieved the ultra&#8208;high increase by a new approach: Rather than using the common method of 2D adsorption of polar molecules layers on the metal surface, WF modifying components, l&#8208;cysteine and Zn(OH)2, were incorporated within the metal, resulting in a 3D architecture. Detailed material characterization by a large array of analytical methods was carried out, the combination of which points to a WF enhancement mechanism which is based on directly affecting the charge transfer ability of the metal separately by cysteine and hydrolyzed zinc(II), and synergistically by the combination of the two through the known Zn&#8208;cysteine finger redox trap effect.

Abstract
MgCo2O4, CoCr2O4, and Co2TiO4 were selected, where only Co3+ in the center of octahedron (Oh), Co2+ in the center of tetrahedron (Td), and Co2+ in the center of Oh, can be active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co3+(Oh) sites are the best geometrical configuration for OER. Co2+(Oh) sites exhibit better activity than Co2+(Td). Calculations demonstrate the conversion of O* into OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step for Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td). For Co2+(Oh), it is thermodynamically favorable for the formation of OOH* but difficult for the desorption of O2. Co3+(Oh) needs to increase the lowest Gibbs free energy over Co2+(Oh) and Co2+(Td), which contributes to the best activity. The coexistence of Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td) in Co3O4 can promote the formation of OOH* and decrease the free&#8208;energy barrier. This work screens out the optimal geometrical configuration of cobalt cations for OER and gives a valuable principle to design efficient electrocatalysts.

      <title>Photoacoustic Imaging Quantifies Drug Release from Nanocarriers via Redox Chemistry of Dye&#8208;Labeled Cargo</title>
      <dc:description>
A covalently linked paclitaxel&#8211;methylene blue conjugate (PTX&#8208;MB) is used for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release from nanocarriers via photoacoustic imaging. The PTX&#8208;MB remained in acoustically silent form when encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. After release, PTX&#8208;MB instantly oxidized to the photoacoustically active form to report quantity and biodistribution.







Abstract
We report a new approach to monitor drug release from nanocarriers via a paclitaxel&#8211;methylene blue conjugate (PTX&#8208;MB) with redox activity. This construct is in a photoacoustically silent reduced state inside poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (PTX&#8208;MB@PLGA NPs). During release, PTX&#8208;MB is spontaneously oxidized to produce a concentration&#8208;dependent photoacoustic signal. An in vitro drug&#8208;release study showed an initial burst release (25&#8201;%) between 0&#8211;24&#8197;h and a sustained release between 24&#8211;120&#8197;h with a cumulative release of 40.6&#8201;% and a 670&#8208;fold increase in photoacoustic signal. An in vivo murine drug release showed a photoacoustic signal enhancement of up to 649&#8201;% after 10&#8197;hours. PTX&#8208;MB@PLGA NPs showed an IC50 of 78&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and 44.7&#177;4.8&#8201;% decrease of tumor burden in an orthotopic model of colon cancer via luciferase&#8208;positive CT26 cells.

      <title>Branching Regulation in Olefin Polymerization via Lewis Acid Triggered Isomerization of Monomers</title>
      <dc:description>
Branch manager: Addition of AlCl3 to a Pd&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking polymerization results in rapid isomerization of 1&#8208;alkenes to internal alkenes which polymerize with high branching. Block copolymers can be prepared by adding AlCl3 midway through the reaction.







Abstract
We present a new strategy to regulate branching in chain&#8208;walking olefin polymerization by triggering a rapid isomerization of 1&#8208;alkene monomers into internal olefins by adding a Lewis acid. Polymerization of internal alkenes proceeds via chain&#8208;walking to give polymers with much higher branching than 1&#8208;alkene analogues. The utility of this approach is exemplified by synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with distinct branching characteristics per block by addition of Lewis acid midway through a reaction. We propose a novel mechanism whereby Lewis acid undergoes a counterion swap with the complex which favors isomerization as well as forming adducts with ancillary ligands, freeing coordination sites for internal alkene coordination polymerization.

      <title>Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry Within Cellulose Nanocrystal Gel Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixing cellulose nanocrystal suspensions (CNC&#8208;Na+) with the polyionic macrocycle cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) yields gels with embedded active hosts. These materials reversibly absorb and recognize guests from solution to produce colorful host&#8211;guest complexes. This behavior has enabled CNC&#8208;CBPQT4+ gels to function as substrates for chromatography and encryption.







Abstract
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) spontaneously assemble into gels when mixed with a polyionic organic or inorganic salt. Here, we have used this ion&#8208;induced gelation strategy to create functional CNC gels with a rigid tetracationic macrocycle, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+). Addition of [CBPQT]Cl4 to CNCs causes gelation and embeds an active host inside the material. The fabricated CNC gels can reversibly absorb guest molecules from solution then undergo molecular recognition processes that create colorful host&#8211;guest complexes. These materials have been implemented in gel chromatography (for guest exchange and separation), and as elements to encode 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional patterns. We anticipate that this concept might be extended to design a set of responsive and selective gel&#8208;like materials functioning as, for instance, water&#8208;pollutant scavengers, substrates for chiral separations, or molecular flasks.

      <title>Stable Polymer Nanoparticles with Exceptionally High Drug Loading by Sequential Nanoprecipitation</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple nanoprecipitation approach is used to produce drug&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles with exceptionally high drug loading (up to 58.5&#8201;%) from a wide range of polymers and drugs. This technology is based on tuning the precipitation time of drugs and polymers using a mixed&#8208;solvent system.







Abstract
Poor solubility often leads to low drug efficacy. Encapsulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in polymeric nanoparticles offers a solution. However, low drug loading remains a critical challenge. Now, a simple and robust sequential nanoprecipitation technology is used to produce stable drug&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles with high drug loading (up to 58.5&#8201;%) from a wide range of polymers and drugs. This technology is based on tuning the precipitation time of drugs and polymers using a solvent system comprising multiple organic solvents, which allows the formation of drug nanoparticles first followed by immediate precipitation of one or two polymers. This technology offers a new strategy to manufacture polymeric nanoparticles with high drug loading having good long&#8208;term stability and programmed release and opens a unique opportunity for drug delivery applications.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Radical Polymerisation by Living Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacteria are able to synthesise complex macromolecules from a variety of natural building blocks. It is now shown that they can also be utilized to produce entirely abiotic polymers from readily available synthetic precursors.







Abstract
The ability to harness cellular redox processes for abiotic synthesis might allow the preparation of engineered hybrid living systems. Towards this goal we describe a new bacteria&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalysed reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP), with a range of metal&#8208;chelating agents and monomers that can be used under ambient conditions with a bacterial redox initiation step to generate polymers. Cupriavidus metallidurans, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium sporogenes species were chosen for their redox enzyme systems and evaluated for their ability to induce polymer formation. Parameters including cell and catalyst concentration, initiator species, and monomer type were investigated. Water&#8208;soluble synthetic polymers were produced in the presence of the bacteria with full preservation of cell viability. This method provides a means by which bacterial redox systems can be exploited to generate &#8220;unnatural&#8221; polymers in the presence of &#8220;host&#8221; cells, thus setting up the possibility of making natural&#8211;synthetic hybrid structures and conjugates.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Metal Ion Precursors for the Synthesis of Nanocomposites for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Benefits of instability: MOFs are used as metal ion precursors for the synthesis of nanocomposites by exploiting the instability of MOFs. The reaction occurs simply by mixing the MOFs, substrates, and other reactants (such as TAA and nickel nitrate). Through a heterogeneous growth process, nanomaterials with uniform structures can be formed on different substrates.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials with fascinating properties. Their widespread applications are sometimes hindered by the intrinsic instability of frameworks. However, this instability of MOFs can also be exploited for useful purposes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of instability&lt;/b&gt;: MOFs are used as metal ion precursors for the synthesis of nanocomposites by exploiting the instability of MOFs. The reaction occurs simply by mixing the MOFs, substrates, and other reactants (such as TAA and nickel nitrate). Through a heterogeneous growth process, nanomaterials with uniform structures can be formed on different substrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials with fascinating properties. Their widespread applications are sometimes hindered by the intrinsic instability of frameworks. However, this instability of MOFs can also be exploited for useful purposes. Herein, we report the use of MOFs as metal ion precursors for constructing functional nanocomposites by utilizing the instability of MOFs. The heterogeneous growth process of nanostructures on substrates involves the release of metal ions, nucleation on substrates, and formation of a covering structure. Specifically, the synthesized CoS with carbon nanotubes as substrates display enhanced performance in a lithium&#8208;ion battery.

      <title>Low&#8208;Fouling Fluoropolymers for Bioconjugation and In&#8197;Vivo Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluoropolymers that are water&#8208;soluble and low&#8208;fouling and have a high fluorine content demonstrate outstanding 19F magnetic resonance imaging sensitivity. They were used as self&#8208;trackable polymers for bioconjugation and in&#8197;vivo tracking.







Abstract
The conjugation of hydrophilic low&#8208;fouling polymers to therapeutic molecules and particles is an effective approach to improving their aqueous stability, solubility, and pharmacokinetics. Recent concerns over the immunogenicity of poly(ethylene glycol) has highlighted the importance of identifying alternative low fouling polymers. Now, a new class of synthetic water&#8208;soluble homo&#8208;fluoropolymers are reported with a sulfoxide side&#8208;chain structure. The incorporation of fluorine enables direct imaging of the homopolymer by 19F MRI, negating the need for additional synthetic steps to attach an imaging moiety. These self&#8208;reporting fluoropolymers show outstanding imaging sensitivity and remarkable hydrophilicity, and as such are a new class of low&#8208;fouling polymer for bioconjugation and in&#8197;vivo tracking.

      <title>Polyhydrazide&#8208;Based Organic Nanotubes as Efficient and Selective Artificial Iodide Channels</title>
      <dc:description>
The right channels: A novel class of foldamer&#8208;based pore&#8208;forming helically folded polyhydrazides, having hydrophobic cavities of about a 6.5&#8197;&#197; diameter, promote transport of anions, rather than cations, across membranes, with iodide as the preferred transport species. The best channel, having a helical height of 3.6 nm, exhibits the highest recorded iodide transport activity (EC50=0.042&#8197;&#956;m or 0.028 mol&#8201;% relative to lipid) and high I&#8722;/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 11, in terms of EC50 values, or 42 based on initial rate constants.







Abstract
Reported herein is a series of pore&#8208;containing polymeric nanotubes based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrazide backbone. Nanotubes of suitable lengths, possessing a hollow cavity of about a 6.5&#8197;&#197; diameter, mediate highly efficient transport of diverse types of anions, rather than cations, across lipid membranes. The reported polymer channel, having an average molecular weight of 18.2&#8197;kDa and 3.6&#8197;nm in helical height, exhibits the highest anion&#8208;transport activities for iodide (EC50=0.042&#8197;&#956;m or 0.028&#8197;mol&#8201;% relative to lipid), whcih is transported 10 times more efficiently than chlorides (EC50=0.47&#8197;&#956;m). Notably, even in cholesterol&#8208;rich environment, iodide transport activity remains high with an EC50 of 0.37&#8197;&#956;m. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that the channel is highly selective for anions and that such anion selectivity arises from a positive electrostatic potential of the central lumen rendered by the interior&#8208;pointing methyl groups.

      <title>A General Strategy to Enhance Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecules Using Solvent&#8208;Excluding Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>
On the bright side: The photophysical behavior of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecules can be improved through installation of a polar, solvent&#8208;shielding auxiliary to an amino&#8208;donating group. This &#946;&#8208;carbonyl substituent generally enhances the fluorescence quantum yield of D&#8208;A fluorophores, enabling brighter labeling probes for live&#8208;cell imaging.







Abstract
While organic donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecules are widely employed in multiple areas, the application of more D&#8208;A molecules could be limited because of an inherent polarity sensitivity that inhibits photochemical processes. Presented here is a facile chemical modification to attenuate solvent&#8208;dependent mechanisms of excited&#8208;state quenching through addition of a &#946;&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;based polar substituent. The results reveal a mechanism wherein the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl substituent creates a structural buffer between the donor and the surrounding solvent. Through computational and experimental analyses, it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl simultaneously attenuates two distinct solvent&#8208;dependent quenching mechanisms. Using the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl substituent, improvements in the photophysical properties of commonly used D&#8208;A fluorophores and their enhanced performance in biological imaging are shown.

      <title>Rational Development of Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization of Biphenyl: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
Remote control: A nitrile&#8208;directed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of biphenyl derivatives was realized by using 2&#8208;pyridone as a ligand. DFT calculations revealed that a new ligand&#8208;containing Pd&#8211;Ag dimeric transition state is responsible for the meta&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
A simple and efficient nitrile&#8208;directed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H olefination, acetoxylation, and iodination of biaryl compounds is reported. Compared to the previous approach of installing a complex U&#8208;shaped template to achieve a molecular U&#8208;turn and assemble the large&#8208;sized cyclophane transition state for the remote C&#8722;H activation, a synthetically useful phenyl nitrile functional group could also direct remote meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation. This reaction provides a useful method for the modification of biaryl compounds because the nitrile group can be readily converted to amines, acids, amides, or other heterocycles. Notably, the remote meta&#8208;selectivity of biphenylnitriles could not be expected from previous results with a macrocyclophane nitrile template. DFT computational studies show that a ligand&#8208;containing Pd&#8211;Ag heterodimeric transition state (TS) favors the desired remote meta&#8208;selectivity. Control experiments demonstrate the directing effect of the nitrile group and exclude the possibility of non&#8208;directed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation. Substituted 2&#8208;pyridone ligands were found to be key in assisting the cleavage of the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond in the concerted metalation&#8211;deprotonation (CMD) process.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Soft Actuators with Switchable Thermal Reprogrammability</title>
      <dc:description>
The old switcheroo: Soft actuators with switchable thermal reprogrammability have been developed. By flexibly switching on/off network dynamics, easy reprogramming and excellent actuation stability can be achieved, as well as efficient recycling and seamless integration of different motions in a very common siloxane liquid crystalline elastomer.







Abstract
Thermal reprogrammability is essential for new&#8208;generation large dry soft actuators, but the realization sacrifices the favored actuation performance. The contradiction between thermal reprogrammability and stability hampers efforts to design high&#8208;performance soft actuators to be robust and thermally adaptable. Now, a strategy has been developed that relies on repeatedly switching on/off thermal reprogrammability in liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomer (LCE) actuators to resolve this problem. By post&#8208;synthesis swelling, a latent siloxane exchange reaction can be induced in the common siloxane LCEs (switching on), enabling reprogramming into on&#8208;demand 3D&#8208;shaped actuators; by switching off the dynamic network by heating, actuation stability is guaranteed even at high temperature (180&#8201;&#176;C). Using partially black&#8208;ink&#8208;patterned LCEs, selectively switching off reprogrammability allows integration of completely different actuation modes in one monolithic actuator for more delicate and elaborate tasks.

      <title>Deconstructive Reorganization: De Novo Synthesis of Hydroxylated Benzofuran</title>
      <dc:description>
Deconstructive arene cycloisomerization is reported as unprecedented strategy for the de novo synthesis of hydroxylated benzofuran, using kojic acid&#8208; or maltol&#8208;derived alkynes as precursors. Several types of free hydroxyl groups are introduced into the benezofurans with different substitution patterns. A collective total synthesis of hydroxylated benzofuran&#8208;containing natural products (11 examples) is realized.







Abstract
An unprecedented deconstructive reorganization strategy for the de novo synthesis of hydroxylated benzofurans from kojic acid&#8208; or maltol&#8208;derived alkynes is reported. In this reaction, both the benzene and furan rings were simultaneously constructed, whereas the pyrone moiety of the kojic acid or maltol was deconstructed and then reorganized into the benzene ring as a six&#8208;carbon component. Through this strategy, at least one free hydroxyl group was introduced into the benzene ring in a substitution&#8208;pattern tunable fashion without protection&#8211;deprotection and redox adjustment. With this method, a large number of hydroxylated benzofuran derivatives with different substitution&#8208;patterns have been prepared efficiently. This methodology has also been shown as the key step in a collective total synthesis of hydroxylated benzofuran&#8208;containing natural products (11 examples).

      <title>A Flexible Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Battery with Excellent Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability</title>
      <dc:description>
Powering the frozen world: The first flexible zinc&#8211;air battery with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability was achieved through the development of an innovative air&#8208;cathodic electrocatalyst and hydrogel electrolyte. The battery delivers a capacity of 691&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 798&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, along with excellent flexibility and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;temperature performance.







Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZAB) are a promising battery candidate for emerging flexible electronic devices, but the catalysis&#8208;based working principle and unique semi&#8208;opened structure pose a severe challenge to their overall performance at cold temperature. Herein, we report the first flexible rechargeable ZAB with excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability, based on the innovation of an efficient electrocatalyst to offset the electrochemical performance shrinkage caused by decreased temperature and a highly conductive hydrogel with a polarized terminal group to render the anti&#8208;freezing property. The fabricated ZABs show excellent electrochemical performances that outperform those of many aqueous ZABs at room temperature. They also deliver a high capacity of 691&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 798&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C (92.7&#8201;% and 87.2&#8201;% retention of the room temperature counterparts, respectively), together with excellent flexibility and reverting capability.

      <title>Intrinsically Low Thermal Conductivity and High Carrier Mobility in Dual Topological Quantum Material, n&#8208;Type BiTe</title>
      <dc:description>
Highs and lows: Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) and high carrier mobility (&#956;) occurs in BiTe, which is facilitated by its unique dual topological quantum phases. It is a weak topological insulator (WTI) as a result of its layered hetero&#8208;structure, and thus it exhibits low thermal conductivity; but simultaneously BiTe is also a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) and thus it has high carrier mobility.







Abstract
A challenge in thermoelectrics is to achieve intrinsically low thermal conductivity in crystalline solids while maintaining a high carrier mobility (&#956;). Topological quantum materials, such as the topological insulator (TI) or topological crystalline insulator (TCI) can exhibit high &#956;. Weak topological insulators (WTI) are of interest because of their layered hetero&#8208;structural nature which has a low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat). BiTe, a unique member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series (m:n=1:2), has both the quantum states, TCI and WTI, which is distinct from the conventional strong TI, Bi2Te3 (where m:n=0:1). Herein, we report intrinsically low &#954;lat of 0.47&#8211;0.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the 300&#8211;650&#8197;K range in BiTe resulting from low energy optical phonon branches which originate primarily from the localized vibrations of Bi bilayer. It has high &#956;&#8776;516&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 707&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 along parallel and perpendicular to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) directions, respectively, at room temperature.

      <title>Guanine&#8208;Stabilized Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Guanine perovskites: Stabilization of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase (FA=formamidinium) is realized by using guaninium (G) based G2PbI4 low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, forming heterostructures that lead to improved performances and stabilities of the corresponding solar cells. The structural properties are investigated to unravel the mode of action and set the path for using this approach in perovskite solar cell research.







Abstract
Formamidinium (FA) lead iodide perovskite materials feature promising photovoltaic performances and superior thermal stabilities. However, conversion of the perovskite &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase to the thermodynamically stable yet photovoltaically inactive &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase compromises the photovoltaic performance. A strategy is presented to address this challenge by using low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite materials comprising guaninium (G) organic spacer layers that act as stabilizers of the three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase. The underlying mode of interaction at the atomic level is unraveled by means of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and DFT calculations. Low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;phase&#8208;containing hybrid FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells are obtained with improved performance and enhanced long&#8208;term stability.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guanine perovskites&lt;/b&gt;: Stabilization of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase (FA=formamidinium) is realized by using guaninium (G) based G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, forming heterostructures that lead to improved performances and stabilities of the corresponding solar cells. The structural properties are investigated to unravel the mode of action and set the path for using this approach in perovskite solar cell research.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formamidinium (FA) lead iodide perovskite materials feature promising photovoltaic performances and superior thermal stabilities. However, conversion of the perovskite &#945;&#8208;FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase to the thermodynamically stable yet photovoltaically inactive &#948;&#8208;FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase compromises the photovoltaic performance. A strategy is presented to address this challenge by using low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite materials comprising guaninium (G) organic spacer layers that act as stabilizers of the three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase. The underlying mode of interaction at the atomic level is unraveled by means of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and DFT calculations. Low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;phase&#8208;containing hybrid FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells are obtained with improved performance and enhanced long&#8208;term stability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Coordinative Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Efficiency in Cytosolic Protein and Peptide Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Stand and deliver: A coordinative dendrimer was rationally designed for cytosolic protein delivery. The synthesized polymer shows unprecedented efficiency in the cytosolic delivery of proteins and peptides with different isoelectric points. The bioactivities of the proteins are maintained after intracellular release.







Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery is a prerequisite for the development of protein therapeutics that act on intracellular targets. Proteins are generally membrane&#8208;impermeable and thus need a carrier such as a polymer to facilitate their internalization. However, the efficient binding of proteins with different isoelectric points to polymeric carriers is challenging. In this study, we designed a coordinative dendrimer to solve this problem. The dendrimers modified with dipicolylamine/zinc(II) complex were capable of binding proteins through a combination of ionic and coordination interactions. The best polymer efficiently delivered 30 cargo proteins and peptides into the cytosol, while maintaining their bioactivity after intracellular release. The removal or replacement of zinc ions in the polymer with other transition&#8208;metal ions lead to significantly decreased efficiency in cytosolic protein delivery. This study provides a new strategy to develop robust and efficient polymers for cytosolic protein delivery.

A coordinative dendrimer delivers 30 types of cargo proteins and peptides into the cytosol of living cells, while maintaining their bioactivity after intracellular release. In their Research Article on page&#8197;4711, Y. Cheng et al. report that dendrimers modified with a dipicolylamine/zinc(II) complex are capable of binding proteins through a combination of ionic and coordination interactions. This provides a new strategy to develop robust and efficient polymers for cytosolic protein delivery.

Photoacoustic imaging enables a new strategy to monitor drug delivery, as reported by J.&#8197;V. Jokerst and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;4678. Here, the paclitaxel drug is tagged with redox&#8208;active methylene blue. This drug&#8211;dye conjugate was sealed inside a poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanocarrier in the reduced state where it does not absorb light. When the drug&#8211;dye conjugate is released, the dye is oxidized to report the location and quantity of the cargo.

      <title>Switching in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
A switch in time: Although dynamic and flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been closely assessed in recent literature, analysis into the subcategory of switchable MOFs has been comparably lacking. By virtue of their steady rise in popularity, MOFs with intriguing, switchable responses to light, temperature, pressure, redox species and guests are surveyed.







Abstract
In recent years, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have become an area of intense research interest because of their adjustable pores and nearly limitless structural diversity deriving from the design of different organic linkers and metal structural building units (SBUs). Among the recent great challenges for scientists include switchable MOFs and their corresponding applications. Switchable MOFs are a type of smart material that undergo distinct, reversible, chemical changes in their structure upon exposure to external stimuli, yielding interesting technological applicability. Although the process of switching shares similarities with flexibility, very limited studies have been devoted specifically to switching, while a fairly large amount of research and a number of Reviews have covered flexibility in MOFs. This Review focuses on the properties and general design of switchable MOFs. The switching activity has been delineated based on the cause of the switching: light, spin crossover (SCO), redox, temperature, and wettability.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Based Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Despite the rapid developments in the past decade, many great challenges remain for the practical use of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based electrocatalysts. This Minireview summaries some major recent research efforts and advances on MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Some promising directions and strategies are also discussed.







Abstract
In view of the clean and sustainable energy, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials, including pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and their derivatives are emerging as unique electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thanks to their tunable compositions and diverse structures, efficient MOF&#8208;based materials provide new opportunities to accelerate the sluggish ORR at the cathode in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. This Minireview first provides some introduction of ORR and MOFs, followed by the classification of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts towards ORR. Recent breakthroughs in engineering MOF&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted with an emphasis on synthesis strategy, component, morphology, structure, electrocatalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. Finally, some current challenges and future perspectives for MOF&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts are also discussed.

      <dc:description>
To prepare high&#8208;quality, defect&#8208;free graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), cycloaromatization reactions need to be very efficient, proceed without side reaction and mild enough to accommodate various functional groups. In this Minireview, the latest approaches for the synthesis of GNRs and related structures, including alkyne benzannulation, photochemical cyclodehydrohalogenation, Mallory and Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed reactions are presented.







Abstract
The solution&#8208;phase synthesis is one of the most promising strategies for the preparation of well&#8208;defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in large scale. To prepare high quality, defect&#8208;free GNRs, cycloaromatization reactions need to be very efficient, proceed without side reaction and mild enough to accommodate the presence of various functional groups. In this Minireview, we present the latest synthetic approaches for the synthesis of GNRs and related structures, including alkyne benzannulation, photochemical cyclodehydrohalogenation, Mallory and Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

      <title>Enantioselective Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions of Indanonecarboxamides with Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Crossing over: A highly efficient asymmetric radical&#8208;polar crossover reaction of indanonecarboxamides/esters and various electron&#8208;rich alkenes was realized by combining a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/NiII complex catalyst with Ag2O. Five types of products could be obtained with good to excellent yields and ee values.







Abstract
Highly efficient asymmetric intermolecular radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were realized by combining a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/NiII complex catalyst with Ag2O under mild reaction conditions. Various terminal alkenes and indanonecarboxamides/esters underwent radical addition/cyclization reactions to afford spiro&#8208;iminolactones and spirolactones with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, a range of different radical&#8208;mediated oxidation/elimination or epoxide ring&#8208;opening products were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The Lewis acid catalysts exhibited excellent performance and precluded the strong background reaction.

The ribosome tolerates aromatic oligoamide foldamer&#8211;peptide hybrids not only when the foldamer belongs to the initiation unit, but also when it is appended as a sidechain within the peptide or at the C&#8208;terminus of the peptide. This expands the range of substrates known to be accepted by the ribosome to include significantly larger and more structurally defined substrates.







Abstract
Derivatives of 4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine with aromatic oligoamide foldamers as sidechain appendages were successfully charged on tRNA by means of flexizymes. Their subsequent incorporation both at the C&#8208;terminus of, and within, peptide sequences by the ribosome, was demonstrated. These results expand the registry of chemical structures tolerated by the ribosome to sidechains significantly larger and more structurally defined than previously demonstrated.

      <title>Synthesis of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Cyclic Peptides via Catalytic Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
An activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted oxidative cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the assembly of biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids was developed for the synthesis of arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.







Abstract
Biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides comprise an intriguing class of structurally diverse natural products with significant biological activity. Especially noteworthy are the antibiotics arylomycin and its synthetic analogue G0775, which exhibits potent activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Herein, we present a simple, flexible, and reliable strategy based on activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted catalytic oxidative coupling for assembling biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids. The synthetic approach was utilized for preparing a number of natural and unnatural biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides, including arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.

Enantioselective construction of axially chiral compounds by the electrophilic carbothiolation of alkynes is disclosed. This transformation is enabled by the use of a tosyl&#8208;protected bifunctional sulfide catalyst and mesyl&#8208;protected ortho&#8208;alkynylaryl amines.

Abstract
The enantioselective construction of axially chiral compounds by electrophilic carbothiolation of alkynes is disclosed for the first time. This enantioselective transformation is enabled by the use of a Ts&#8208;protected bifunctional sulfide catalyst and Ms&#8208;protected ortho&#8208;alkynylaryl amines (Ts=tosyl; Ms=mesyl). Both electrophilic arylthiolating and electrophilic trifluoromethylthiolating reagents are suitable for this reaction. The obtained products of axially chiral vinyl&#8211;aryl amino sulfides can be easily converted into biaryl amino sulfides, biaryl amino sulfoxides, biaryl amines, vinyl&#8211;aryl amines, and other valuable difunctionalized compounds.

      <title>Access to Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Polypropylene through Coordination Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Selective coordination polymerization of allenes was achieved using rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal precursors. The resultant polyallenes can be easily transformed into the poly(allyl alcohol) derivatives through hydroboration/oxidation. The copolymerization of propylene and allene monomers also proceeds to afford unprecedented hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polypropylene after post&#8208;functionalization. DFT simulations suggests kinetic rather than thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Preparation of polyethylenes containing hydroxy groups has been already industrialized through radical copolymerization under harsh conditions followed by alcoholysis. By contrast, hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polypropylene has proven a rather challenging goal in polymer science. Propylene can't be polymerized through a radical mechanism, and its coordination copolymerization with polar monomers is frustrated by catalyst poisoning. Herein, we report a new strategy to reach this target. The coordination polymerization of allenes by rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal precursors affords pure 1,2&#8208;regulated polyallenes, which are facilely transformed into poly(allyl alcohol) analogues by subsequent hydroboration/oxidation. Strikingly, the copolymerization of allenes and propylene gives unprecedented hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polypropylene after post&#8208;polymerization modification. Mechanistic elucidation by DFT simulation suggests kinetic rather than thermodynamic control.

      <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Cationic Boron Complexes Distorted by Pyridine&#8208;based Pincer Ligands: Isolation of a Photochemical Hofmann&#8211;Martius&#8208;type Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron fit to a T: Pincer ligands distort boron cations toward a T&#8208;shaped geometry, enabling new reactivity patterns including a photochemical C&#8722;C formation/C&#8722;N cleavage yielding a Hofmann&#8211;Martius&#8208;type intermediate.







Abstract
A family of cationic boron complexes was synthesized, using a dianilidopyridine pincer ligand, which imposes in&#8208;plane distortion of the geometry at boron towards T&#8208;shaped. Reactivity of these cations toward hydride and base was investigated, and the utility of these cations as precursors to a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated BN heterocycles was demonstrated. 300&#8197;nm irradiation of a deprotonated pincer boron complex triggered a C&#8722;N cleavage/C&#8722;C formation yielding a dearomatized boryl imine, which has a structure akin to the long&#8208;proposed intermediate in the photochemical Hofmann&#8211;Martius rearrangement. The photo&#8208;rearrangement triggers relief of the distortion imposed by the pincer ligand.

      <title>Formation and Fate of Formaldehyde in Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbon Reaction: In Situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Formaldehyde (HCHO) was unambiguously detected and quantified for the first time during methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon catalysis over HSAPO&#8208;34 and HZSM&#8208;5 by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry. The time&#8208;resolved profiles of products show that HCHO is mainly derived from the disproportionation of methanol at acidic sites, HCHO affects the hydrogen&#8208;transfer processes of olefins into aromatics and aromatics into coke, and HCHO controls the contribution of the aromatic&#8208;based cycle.







Abstract
HCHO has been confirmed as an active intermediate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon (MTH) reaction, and is critical for interpreting the mechanisms of coke formation. Here, HCHO was detected and quantified during the MTH process over HSAPO&#8208;34 and HZSM&#8208;5 by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry. Compared with conventional methods, excellent time&#8208;resolved profiles were obtained to study the formation and fate of HCHO, and other products during the induction, steady&#8208;state reaction, and deactivation periods. Similar formation trends of HCHO and methane, and their close correlation in yields suggest that they are derived from disproportionation of methanol at acidic sites. In the presence of Y2O3, the amount of HCHO changes, affecting the hydrogen&#8208;transfer processes of olefins into aromatics and aromatics into cokes. The yield of HCHO affects the aromatic&#8208;based cycle and the formation of ethylene, indicating that ethylene is mainly formed from the aromatic&#8208;based cycle.

Similar formation trends of HCHO and methane, and their close correlation in yields suggest that they are derived from disproportionation of methanol at acidic sites. In the presence of Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the amount of HCHO changes, affecting the hydrogen&#8208;transfer processes of olefins into aromatics and aromatics into cokes. The yield of HCHO affects the aromatic&#8208;based cycle and the formation of ethylene, indicating that ethylene is mainly formed from the aromatic&#8208;based cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Activation by a Molecular Aluminium Imide: C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage and C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
C&#8722;C coupling: An isolable molecular aluminium imide with a highly polarized Al&#8722;N bond has been found to react with CO via C&#8801;O bond cleavage and C&#8722;C coupling. Key proposed intermediates in this transformation feature an aluminium&#8208;bound isocyanate fragment.







Abstract
Anionic molecular imide complexes of aluminium are accessible via a rational synthetic approach involving the reactions of organo azides with a potassium aluminyl reagent. In the case of K2[(NON)Al(NDipp)]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) structural characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a short Al&#8722;N distance, which is thought primarily to be due to the low coordinate nature of the nitrogen centre. The Al&#8722;N unit is highly polar, and capable of the activation of relatively inert chemical bonds, such as those found in dihydrogen and carbon monoxide. In the case of CO, uptake of two molecules of the substrate leads to C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8801;O bond cleavage. Thermodynamically, this is driven, at least in part, by Al&#8722;O bond formation. Mechanistically, a combination of quantum chemical and experimental observations suggests that the reaction proceeds via exchange of the NR and O substituents through intermediates featuring an aluminium&#8208;bound isocyanate fragment.

      <title>Direct Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams from Acrylamides and Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of unprotected &#948;&#8208;lactams has been realized starting from readily accessible acrylamides and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides an efficient means of synthesizing a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines.







Abstract
We report a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available acrylamide derivatives and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides a rapid route to a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines. The regioselectivity of the reaction with unactivated terminal alkene is significantly improved by using Cpt ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The synthetic utility of the reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of a potential drug candidate containing a trisubstituted piperidine moiety. Mechanistic studies show that the reversibility of the C&#8722;H activation depends on the choice of Cp ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The irreversible C&#8722;H activation is observed and becomes turnover&#8208;limiting with [CptRhCl2]2 as catalyst.

      <title>Molecular Evidence for Metallic Cobalt Boosting CO2 Electroreduction on Pyridinic Nitrogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts are presented for application in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Molecular probes were designed to clarify the genuine catalytically active sites. CO2RR takes place preferentially on pyridinic rather than pyrrolic nitrogen, and metallic cobalt nanoparticles enhance the CO2RR on pyridinic nitrogen significantly.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials (N&#8208;Cmat) are emerging as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), although the activities are still unsatisfactory and the genuine active site is still under debate. We demonstrate that the CO2RR to CO preferentially takes place on pyridinic N rather than pyrrolic N using phthalocyanine (Pc) and porphyrin with well&#8208;defined N&#8208;Cmat configurations as molecular model catalysts. Systematic experiments and theoretic calculations further reveal that the CO2RR performance on pyridinic N can be significantly boosted by electronic modulation from in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated metallic Co nanoparticles. By introducing Co nanoparticles, Co@Pc/C can achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 84&#8201;% and CO current density of 28&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V, which are 18 and 47 times higher than Pc/C without Co, respectively. These findings provide new insights into the CO2RR on N&#8208;Cmat, which may guide the exploration of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction.

      <title>Proton Insertion Chemistry of a Zinc&#8211;Organic Battery</title>

Proton insertion chemistry based on organic aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) was developed in a mild electrolyte. The H+ insertion/extraction endows the battery system with enhanced electrochemical performance. Moreover, the proton insertion chemistry will broaden horizons of aqueous ZIBs.







Abstract
Proton storage in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) is attracting extensive attention owing to the fast kinetics of H+ insertion/extraction. However, it has not been achieved in organic materials&#8208;based ZIBs with a mild electrolyte. Now, aqueous ZIBs based on diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) in a mild electrolyte are developed. Electrochemical and structural analysis confirm for the first time that such Zn&#8211;HATN batteries experience a H+ uptake/removal behavior with highly reversible structural evolution of HATN. The H+ uptake/removal endows the Zn&#8211;HATN batteries with enhanced electrochemical performance. Proton insertion chemistry will broaden the horizons of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries and open up new opportunities to construct high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

      <title>Acetylene as a Dicarbene Equivalent for Gold(I) Catalysis: Total Synthesis of Waitziacuminone in One Step</title>
      <dc:description>
Acetylene gas behaves as a dicarbene equivalent in the presence of gold(I). This concept has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of acetylene gas with alkenes leads to (Z,Z)&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;butadienes and biscyclopropanes depending on the donor ligand on gold(I). Acetylene was generated in&#8197;situ from calcium carbide and water in a user&#8208;friendly procedure. Reaction of acetylene with 1,5&#8208;dienes gives rise stereoselectively to tricyclo[5.1.0.02,4]octanes. This novel double cyclopropanation has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Acetylene as a Dicarbene Equivalent for Gold(I) Catalysis: Total Synthesis of Waitziacuminone in One Step"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acetylene gas behaves&lt;/b&gt; as a dicarbene equivalent in the presence of gold(I). This concept has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of acetylene gas with alkenes leads to (Z,Z)&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;butadienes and biscyclopropanes depending on the donor ligand on gold(I). Acetylene was generated in&#8197;situ from calcium carbide and water in a user&#8208;friendly procedure. Reaction of acetylene with 1,5&#8208;dienes gives rise stereoselectively to tricyclo[5.1.0.0&lt;sup&gt;2,4&lt;/sup&gt;]octanes. This novel double cyclopropanation has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [4+2] Cycloadditions of Vinylcarbenes with Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective [4+2] cycloaddition: A mechanistically unusual approach for a highly enantioselective [4+2] cycloaddition between rhodium&#8208;stabilized vinylcarbenes and siloxydienes was developed. The reaction is initiated by attack of the diene at the vinylogous position of the vinylcarbene and the outcome is dependent of the reacting conformation of the vinylcarbene intermediate.







Abstract
The reaction of 2&#8208;siloxycyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with E&#8208;vinyldiazoacetates in the presence of the bulky chiral dirhodium tetracarboxylate catalyst, Rh2(R&#8208;p&#8208;PhTPCP)4 results in an enantioselective [4+2] cycloaddition, in which three new stereogenic centers are formed. The [4+2] cycloadducts are generated as single diastereomers with high enantiocontrol (95&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). When the diene contains an additional stereogenic center, effective kinetic resolution can be achieved.

      <title>Biomimetic Strain&#8208;Stiffening Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogels have been prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of molecular gelators. On the basis of orthogonal self&#8208;assembly of the molecular gelators and lipids, hydrogel networks embedded with liposomes are formed and show strain&#8208;stiffening behavior as well, resembling both the structures and mechanical responsiveness of biological tissue.







Abstract
Supramolecular structures with strain&#8208;stiffening properties are ubiquitous in nature but remain rare in the lab. Herein, we report on strain&#8208;stiffening supramolecular hydrogels that are entirely produced through the self&#8208;assembly of synthetic molecular gelators. The involved gelators self&#8208;assemble into semi&#8208;flexible fibers, which thereby crosslink into hydrogels. Interestingly, these hydrogels are capable of stiffening in response to applied stress, resembling biological intermediate filaments system. Furthermore, strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogel networks embedded with liposomes are constructed through orthogonal self&#8208;assembly of gelators and phospholipids, mimicking biological tissues in both architecture and mechanical properties. This work furthers the development of biomimetic soft materials with mechanical responsiveness and presents potentially enticing applications in diverse fields, such as tissue engineering, artificial life, and strain sensors.

      <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted Alignment of Carbon Nanotubes on DNA Origami</title>
      <dc:description>
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) are used to precisely position carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on DNA origami. The DNA hybridization occurring at the interface of the SNA and DNA&#8208;coated CNTs leads to an approximately five&#8208;fold improvement in the positioning efficiency in comparison to the positioning of DNA&#8208;coated CNTs directly on the DNA origami.







Abstract
Aligning carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a key challenge for fabricating CNT&#8208;based electronic devices. Herein, we report a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) mediated approach for the highly precise alignment of CNTs at prescribed sites on DNA origami. We find that the cooperative DNA hybridization occurring at the interface of SNA and DNA&#8208;coated CNTs leads to an approximately five&#8208;fold improvement of the positioning efficiency. By combining this with the intrinsic positioning addressability of DNA origami, CNTs can be aligned in parallel with an extremely small angular variation of within 10&#176;. Moreover, we demonstrate that the parallel alignment of CNTs prevents incorrect logic functionality originating from stray conducting paths formed by misaligned CNTs. This SNA&#8208;mediated method thus holds great potential for fabricating scalable CNT arrays for nanoelectronics.

      <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nm sieving: A flexible supramolecular membrane for the sub&#8208;nanometer sieving of nanoparticles is developed. This membrane comprises a highly oriented, honeycomb&#8208;like, two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer with uniform nanocavities.

Abstract
The development of size&#8208;selective membranes with well&#8208;defined nanopores towards the precise separation of nanometer&#8208;sized substances is a challenging task to achieve. Here a supramolecular membrane is presented that comprises a highly oriented, honeycomb&#8208;like, 2D supramolecular polymer on a polycarbonate filter support. It enables precise size&#8208;selective sieving of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs). Owing to the uniform parallel&#8208;aligned nanocavities within the 2D supramolecular polymers, the composite membrane shows a high size&#8208;selectivity with a sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy in the cutoff size of about 4.0&#8197;nm. In principle, the species of size&#8208;separable particles are unlimited, as demonstrated by quantum dots, noble metal, and metal oxide NPs. This supramolecular membrane combined with filtration advances the potential of NPs in terms of their monochromatic emission and size monodispersity, and also enables rapid removal of small magnetic NP adsorbents that are otherwise difficult to capture.

      <title>Mechanical Force Induces Ylide&#8208;Free Cycloaddition of Nonscissible Aziridines</title>
      <dc:description>
The force awakens: Mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced cycloaddition of intact aziridine groups in a macromolecule with dipolarophiles does not follow the reaction pathways that occur under traditional thermal and photochemical conditions. The aziridines do not undergo cis&#8211;trans isomerization, thus suggesting retention of the ring structure under force. This demonstrates that nonvulnerable chemical structures can be attractive mechanophores.







Abstract
The application of aziridines as nonvulnerable mechanophores is reported. Upon exposure to a mechanical force, stereochemically pure nonactivated aziridines incorporated into the backbone of a macromolecule do not undergo cis&#8211;trans isomerization, thus suggesting retention of the ring structure under force. Nonetheless, aziridines react with a dipolarophile and seem not to obey conventional reaction pathways that involve C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond cleavage prior to the cycloaddition. Our work demonstrates that a nonvulnerable chemical structure can be a mechanophore.

      <title>&#8220;Self&#8208;Lockable&#8221; Liquid Crystalline Diels&#8211;Alder Dynamic Network Actuators with Room Temperature Programmability and Solution Reprocessability</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystalline dynamic networks can be shaped into 3D objects at room temperature while being stabilized by slowly formed Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;bonded (DA) cross&#8208;links. The actuators demonstrate thermally or optically induced reversible shape change for the purpose of performing mechanical work or locomotion.







Abstract
Novel main&#8208;chain liquid crystalline Diels&#8212;Alder dynamic networks (LCDANs) were prepared that exhibit unprecedented ease for actuator programming and reprocessing compared to existing liquid crystalline network (LCN) systems. Following cooling from 125&#8201;&#176;C, LCDANs are deformed with aligned mesogens self&#8208;locked at room temperature by slowly formed Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) bonds, which allows for the formation of solid 3D actuators capable of reversible shape change, and strip walker and wheel&#8208;capable light&#8208;driven locomotion upon either thermally or optically induced order&#8211;disorder phase transition. Any actuator can readily be erased at 125&#8201;&#176;C and reprogrammed into a new one under ambient conditions. Moreover, LCDANs can be processed directly from melt (for example, fiber drawing) and from solution (for example, casting tubular actuators), which cannot be achieved with LCNs using exchangeable covalent bonds. The combined attributes of LCDANs offer significant progress toward developing easily programmable/processable LCN actuators.

      <title>A Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structure for Charge Transport and Active Sites in Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Live LICs: The balance of active sites and charge transport allow Nb2O5 with a hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure to deliver excellent energy density, an ultrahigh power density, and good cycle stability for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs).







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;ion capacitor (LIC) has attracted tremendous research interest because it meets both the requirement on high energy and power densities. The balance between effective surface areas and mass transport is highly desired to fabricate the optimized electrode material for LIC. Now, triple&#8208;shelled (3S) Nb2O5 hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) were synthesized for the first time through the sequential templating approach and then applied for the anode of LIC. The unique structure of HoMSs, such as large efficient surface area, hierarchical pores, and multiple shells, provides abundant reaction sites, decreases the electron transport resistance, and increases the diffusion rate for ion transport. In this case, the best combination performance has been achieved among all the reported Nb2O5&#8208;based materials, which delivered an excellent energy and power densities simultaneously, and superb cycling stability.

      <title>Biomimetic Hydrogenation Catalyzed by a Manganese Model of [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>
The design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is reported. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H4MPT+, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase is an efficient biological hydrogenation catalyst. Despite intense research, Fe complexes mimicking the active site of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase have not achieved turnovers in hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we describe the design and development of a manganese(I) mimic of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This complex exhibits the highest activity and broadest scope in catalytic hydrogenation among known mimics. Thanks to its biomimetic nature, the complex exhibits unique activity in the hydrogenation of compounds analogous to methenyl&#8208;H4MPT+, the natural substrate of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. This activity enables asymmetric relay hydrogenation of benzoxazinones and benzoxazines, involving the hydrogenation of a chiral hydride transfer agent using our catalyst coupled to Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed hydride transfer from this agent to the substrates.

      <title>Production of Hydroxy Acids: Selective Double Oxidation of Diols by Flavoprotein Alcohol Oxidase</title>
      <dc:description>
Triple action: The flavoprotein alcohol oxidase (AOX*) facilitates the double and triple oxidations of diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. Such biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids has potential for the preparation of polyester building blocks.







Abstract
Flavoprotein oxidases can catalyze oxidations of alcohols and amines by merely using molecular oxygen as the oxidant, making this class of enzymes appealing for biocatalysis. The FAD&#8208;containing (FAD=flavin adenine dinucleotide) alcohol oxidase from P. chrysosporium facilitated double and triple oxidations for a range of aliphatic diols. Interestingly, depending on the diol substrate, these reactions result in formation of either lactones or hydroxy acids. For example, diethylene glycol could be selectively and fully converted into 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethoxy)acetic acid. Such a facile cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalytic route towards hydroxy acids opens up new avenues for the preparation of polyester building blocks.

Stack a nanoribbon: A facile method for atomically precise graphdiyne nanoribbons has been developed. The method featured inter&#8208; and intramolecular stepwise Glaser&#8211;Hay coupling strategy to reduce random intermolecular polymerization of the ethynyl groups.







Abstract
Graphdiyne nanoribbons with high chemical precision are of great significance for further understanding of the intrinsic properties of graphdiyne and the relationship between structure and properties. However, the reliable synthesis of graphdiyne nanoribbons with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. A facile method is now presented for fabrication of graphdiyne nanoribbons with uniform width through stepwise inter&#8208; and intramolecular Glaser&#8211;Hay coupling reaction of ethynyl groups. The synthetic ribbons were interwoven into nanotextiles by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and were applied for protective coating of Li&#8208;electrode in Li&#8208;ion batteries, which efficiently suppressed the growth of the Li dendrites during cycling and prolonged the life span of Li&#8208;metal batteries.

      <title>Emerging Cubic Chirality in &#947;CD&#8208;MOF for Fabricating Circularly Polarized Luminescent Crystalline Materials and the Size Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest interaction between the chiral void of &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and achiral luminophores with different charges and sizes are presented. Numerous achiral luminophores could be integrated into &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and emitted significantly boosted positive or negative circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). When the size of the guest luminophores was close to the cube size, strong negative CPL was observed.







Abstract
The chiral feature of &#947;CD&#8208;MOF, and especially the emergent cubic void, was not unveiled so far. Now, through the host&#8211;guest interaction between &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and achiral luminophores with different charges and sizes, the unique cubic chirality of the emerging void in &#947;CD&#8208;MOF as well as a size effect on CPL induction are revealed for the first time. Numerous achiral luminophores could be integrated into &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and emitted significantly boosted circularly polarized luminescence. While the small sized luminophores preferred to be loaded into the intrinsic void of &#947;CD, large ones were selectively encapsulated into the cubic void. Interestingly, when the size of the guest luminophores was close to the cube size, it showed strong negative CPL. Otherwise, either positive or negative CPL was induced.

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Bifunctionalization of 3&#8208;Iodo&#8208;o&#8208;Carborane by Pd Migration</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly regioselective sequential activation of cage B&#8722;I and B&#8722;H bonds in o&#8208;carborane has been achieved in a one&#8208;pot manner. The thermodynamically favorable migration of Pd from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 carbon to cage B(4) serves as a key step in this new process, which represents a new route for regioselective bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carborane with different substituents.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly selective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of 3&#8208;I&#8208;o&#8208;carborane has been developed, leading to the preparation of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;4&#8208;R&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes (R=alkyl, alkynyl, aryl, allyl, CN, and amido) in high to excellent yields. This protocol combines the sequential activation of cage B(3)&#8722;I and B(4)&#8722;H bonds by Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to cage B(4), which is driven by thermodynamic force. This represents a brand&#8208;new strategy for selective bifunctionalization of carboranes with two different substituents.

      <title>Supramolecular Tuning Enables Selective Oxygen Reduction Catalyzed by Cobalt Porphyrins for Direct Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide
</title>
      <dc:description>
ORR inspiring: Incorporating cobalt porphyrins into a porous supramolecular cage structure isolates molecular active sites for selective electrochemical oxygen reduction, leading to direct electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide in neutral pH water.







Abstract
We report a supramolecular strategy for promoting the selective reduction of O2 for direct electrosynthesis of H2O2. We utilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (Co&#8208;TPP), an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst with highly variable product selectivity, as a building block to assemble the permanently porous supramolecular cage Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) bearing six Co&#8208;TPP subunits connected through twenty&#8208;four imine bonds. Reduction of these imine linkers to amines yields the more flexible cage Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6). Both Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) and Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6) cages produce 90&#8211;100&#8201;% H2O2 from electrochemical ORR catalysis in neutral pH water, whereas the Co&#8208;TPP monomer gives a 50&#8201;% mixture of H2O2 and H2O. Bimolecular pathways have been implicated in facilitating H2O formation, therefore, we attribute this high H2O2 selectivity to site isolation of the discrete molecular units in each supramolecule. The ability to control reaction selectivity in supramolecular structures beyond traditional host&#8211;guest interactions offers new opportunities for designing such architectures for a broader range of catalytic applications.

      <title>Li[LiCs2Cl][Ga3S6]: A Nanoporous Framework of GaS4 Tetrahedra with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
The salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenide Li[LiCs2Cl][Ga3S6] is presented, which features a 3D framework composed of [Ga3S6] nanosized tunnels. Introduction of an ionic guest to the covalent chalcogenide host produces a material with a moderate nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficient and an ultrawide band gap (Eg). These characteristics are promising for the development of infrared (IR) NLO materials.







Abstract
A large nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficient and a wide band gap are two crucial but contradictory parameters that are difficult to achieve simultaneously in a single infrared (IR) NLO compound. A salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenide (SIC), Li[LiCs2Cl][Ga3S6] (1), was prepared that presents a nanosized tunnel framework constructed from monotype chalcogenide tetrahedra. Highly oriented covalent GaS4 tetrahedra in the host lead to a moderate second harmonic generation response (0.7&#8201;AgGaS2), and ionic guests effectively broaden the band gap to the widest value (4.18&#8197;eV) among all IR NLO chalcogenides, thereby achieving a remarkable balance between NLO efficiency and band gap.

      <title>Sodium Dithionite&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Sulfonylation: Facile Access to Tertiary Sulfones</title>
      <dc:description>A straightforward multicomponent decarboxylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;active esters ( N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester), sodium dithionite and electrophiles was established to construct sterically bulky sulfones.

      <title>Construction of Hydrocarbon Nanobelts</title>

      <title>Synthesis of Poly(acyclic orthoester)s: Acid&#8208;Sensitive Biomaterials for Enhancing Immune Responses of Protein Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Drug release: While poly(orthoester)s have many advantages, the synthesis of poly(acyclic orthoester)s has not yet been reported. Here the facile synthesis of poly(acyclic orthoester)s by polycondensation of acyclic diketene acetals and diols is developed. Poly(acyclic orthoester) nanoparticles release antigens into the cytoplasm, enhancing antigen presentation efficiency, and could serve to broaden the applications of poly(orthoester)s in protein&#8208; and gene&#8208;based therapies.







Abstract
While poly(acyclic orthoester)s (PAOEs) have many appealing features for drug delivery, their application is significantly hindered by a lack of facile synthetic methods. Reported here is a simple method for synthesizing acyclic diketene acetal monomers from diols and vinyl ether, and their polymerization with a diol to first synthesize PAOEs. The PAOEs rapidly hydrolyze at lysosomal pH. With the help of a cationic lipid, ovalbumin, a model vaccine antigen was efficiently loaded into PAOEs nanoparticles using a double emulsion method. These nanoparticles efficiently delivered ovalbumin into the cytosol of dendritic cells and demonstrated enhanced antigen presentation over poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. PAOEs are promising vehicles for intracellular delivery of biopharmaceuticals and could increase the utility of poly(orthoesters) in biomedical research.

      <title>CF3SO2Na as a Bifunctional Reagent: Electrochemical Trifluoromethylation of Alkenes Accompanied by SO2 Insertion to Access Trifluoromethylated Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines</title>
      <dc:description>
Double agent: An electrochemical trifluoromethylation/SO2 insertion/cyclization process using an undivided cell proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion. Various trifluoromethylated cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines can be readily accessed from readily available materials by using Langlois&#8217; reagent as a source of both CF3 and SO2 in a single operation under direct anodically oxidative conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented electrochemical trifluoromethylation/SO2&#8197;insertion/cyclization process has been achieved in an undivided cell in an atom&#8208;economic fashion. The protocol relies on tandem cyclization of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes by using Langlois&#8217; reagent as a source of both CF3 and SO2 under direct anodically oxidative conditions, in which two C&#8722;C bonds, two C&#8722;X bonds (N&#8722;S and S&#8722;C), and two rings were formed in a single operation. This transformation enabled efficient construction of various trifluoromethylated cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines from readily accessible materials.

      <title>A Hydrolase&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Forms the Fused Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactone in Vibralactone</title>
      <dc:description>
The cyclization of an oxepinone (3) to form a fused bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactone (1) proceeds by a ring&#8208;opening aldol&#8208;lactonization cascade or a pericyclic reaction driven by the Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp catalytic triad of the cyclase VibC from the basidiomycete Boreostereum vibrans.







Abstract
Vibralactone is isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Boreostereum vibrans as one of the strongest lipase inhibitors. Its unusual &#946;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused bicycle is derived from an aryl ring moiety by an oxidative ring&#8208;expansion prior to an intramolecular cyclization. Herein, we report the discovery of the cyclase VibC which belongs to the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase superfamily and is involved in the vibralactone biosynthesis. Biochemical and crystal studies suggest that VibC may catalyze an aldol or an electrocyclic reaction initiated by the Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp catalytic triad. For the aldol and pericyclic chemistry in living cells, VibC is a unique hydrolase performing the carbocycle formation of an oxepinone to a fused bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactone. This presents a naturally occurring, new enzymatic reaction in both aldol and hydrolase (bio)chemistry that will guide future exploitation of these enzymes in synthetic biology for chemical&#8208;diversity expansion of natural products.

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Benzilic Ester Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>
Paradigm shift: Hemiketal formation is the enantio&#8208;determining step, against the commonly accepted mechanism in catalytic enantioselective rearrangement of benzilic esters.







Abstract
We report the first examples of catalytic enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement reaction. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(OTf)2 and a chiral box ligand under mild conditions, reaction of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters with alcohols afforded structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl(alkyl) substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy malonates (tartronic esters) in good to excellent yields with high enantioselectivities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that hemiketalization, rather than the dynamic kinetic resolution of hemiketal, was the enantiodetermining step under our reaction conditions.

      <title>Water&#8208;Insensitive Synthesis of Poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Peptides with Defined Architecture</title>
      <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insensitive, controllable and living &#946;&#8208;NTA polymerization was developed to prepare poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides in open vessels. The method is characterized by high yields, diverse functional groups, variable chain length, narrow dispersity, defined architecture, and easy tuning of both terminal groups.







Abstract
Biocompatible and proteolysis&#8208;resistant poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides have broad applications and are dominantly synthesized via the harsh and water&#8208;sensitive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#946;&#8208;lactams in a glovebox or using a Schlenk line, catalyzed by the strong base LiN(SiMe3)2. We have developed a controllable and water&#8208;insensitive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#946;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;thiocarboxyanhydrides (&#946;&#8208;NTAs) that can be operated in open vessels to prepare poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides in high yields, with diverse functional groups, variable chain length, narrow dispersity and defined architecture. These merits imply wide applications of &#946;&#8208;NTA polymerization and resulting poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptides, which is validated by the finding of a HDP&#8208;mimicking poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptide with potent antimicrobial activities. The living &#946;&#8208;NTA polymerization enables the controllable synthesis of random, block copolymers and easy tuning of both terminal groups of polypeptides, which facilitated the unravelling of the antibacterial mechanism using the fluorophore&#8208;labelled poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;peptide.

      <title>Pseudo&#8208;Stereodivergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched Tetrasubstituted Alkenes by Cascade 1,3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;Allylation/Cope Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>
All possible stereoisomers: The switchable pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent synthesis of enantioenriched tetrasubstituted alkenes from isatin&#8208;based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and allylic benzoates was developed under the cooperative catalysis of a tertiary amine and a chiral iridium complex, through a diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;allylation reaction and a stereoselective 3,3&#8208;Cope rearrangement. All four possible stereoisomers are constructed with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic diastereodivergent construction of stereoisomers having two or more stereogenic centers has been extensively studied. In contrast, the switchable introduction of another stereogenic element, that is, Z/E configuration involving a polysubstituted alkene group, into the optically active stereoisomers, has not been recognized yet. Disclosed here is the pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent synthesis of highly enantioenriched tetrasubstituted alkene architectures from isatin&#8208;based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and allylic derivatives, under the cooperative catalysis of a tertiary amine and a chiral iridium complex. The success of the switchable construction of the tetrasubstituted alkene motif relies on the diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;allylation reaction between N&#8208;allylic ylides and chiral &#960;&#8208;allyliridium complex intermediates by ligand and substrate control, followed by the stereoselective concerted 3,3&#8208;Cope rearrangement process.

      <title>De Novo Construction of Catenanes with Dissymmetric Cages by Space&#8208;Discriminative Post&#8208;Assembly Modification</title>
      <dc:description>
Best left for later: Catenanes with dissymmetric cages (CDCs) were prepared by first synthesizing imine&#8208;based CSCs (catenanes with symmetric cages) and then selectively reducing the outer surface with the voluminous reductant NaBH(OAc)3 (see picture). Experimental and computational analysis further elucidated the template&#8208;facilitated interlocking mechanism for the construction of three&#8208;dimensional catenanes composed of purely organic constituents.







Abstract
Considerable efforts have been made to increase the topological complexity of mechanically interlocked molecules over the years. Three&#8208;dimensional catenated structures composed of two or several (usually symmetrical) cages are one representative example. However, owing to the lack of an efficient universal synthetic strategy, interlocked structures made up of dissymmetric cages are relatively rare. Since the space volume of the inner cavity of an interlocked structure is smaller than that outside it, we developed a novel synthetic approach with the voluminous reductant NaBH(OAc)3 that discriminates this space difference, and therefore selectively reduces the outer surface of a catenated dimer composed of two symmetric cages, thus yielding the corresponding catenane with dissymmetric cages. Insight into the template effect that facilitates the catenation of cages was provided by computational and experimental techniques.

      <title>Solar&#8208;Powered Organic Semiconductor&#8211;Bacteria Biohybrids for CO2 Reduction into Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Lighting up Moorella: An organic semiconductor&#8211;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system is presented that efficiently reduces CO2 to produce acetic acid through the non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria Moorella thermoacetica.







Abstract
An organic semiconductor&#8211;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system is used to efficiently realize CO2 reduction to produce acetic acid with the non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria Moorella thermoacetica. Perylene diimide derivative (PDI) and poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) were coated on the bacteria surface as photosensitizers to form a p&#8208;n heterojunction (PFP/PDI) layer, affording higher hole/electron separation efficiency. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability and biocompatibility, and the cationic side chains of organic semiconductors could intercalate into cell membranes, ensuring efficient electron transfer to bacteria. Moorella thermoacetica can thus harvest photoexcited electrons from the PFP/PDI heterojunction, driving the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway to synthesize acetic acid from CO2 under illumination. The efficiency of this organic biohybrid is about 1.6&#8201;%, which is comparable to those of reported inorganic biohybrid systems.

      <title>A Direct S0&#8594;Tn Transition in the Photoreaction of Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Forget about forbiddance: Spectroscopic experiments reveal that photoreactions of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing molecules with light in an apparently non&#8208;absorbing region proceed via a forbidden direct S0&#8594;Tn transition. This phenomenon occurs in the photoreaction of aryl iodides (oxidation states I, III, and V), aryl bromides, and bismuth(III)&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
According to the Grotthuss&#8211;Draper law, light must be absorbed by a substrate to initiate a photoreaction. There have been several reports, however, on the promotion of photoreactions using hypervalent iodine during irradiation with light from a non&#8208;absorbing region. This contradiction gave rise to a mystery regarding photoreactions involving hypervalent iodine. We demonstrated that the photoactivation of hypervalent iodine with light from the apparently non&#8208;absorbing region proceeds via a direct S0&#8594;Tn transition, which has been considered a forbidden process. Spectroscopic, computational, and synthetic experimental results support this conclusion. Moreover, the photoactivation mode could be extended to monovalent iodine and bromine, as well as bismuth(III)&#8208;containing molecules, providing new possibilities for studying photoreactions that involve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing molecules.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Grotthuss&#8211;Draper law, light must be absorbed by a substrate to initiate a photoreaction. There have been several reports, however, on the promotion of photoreactions using hypervalent iodine during irradiation with light from a non&#8208;absorbing region. This contradiction gave rise to a mystery regarding photoreactions involving hypervalent iodine. We demonstrated that the photoactivation of hypervalent iodine with light from the apparently non&#8208;absorbing region proceeds via a direct S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; transition, which has been considered a forbidden process. Spectroscopic, computational, and synthetic experimental results support this conclusion. Moreover, the photoactivation mode could be extended to monovalent iodine and bromine, as well as bismuth(III)&#8208;containing molecules, providing new possibilities for studying photoreactions that involve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Underestimated color centers: Defects as useful reducing agents in lanthanide&#8208;activated luminescent materials</title>

Upon intentional doping with EuCl  3  and without employment of any reducing conditions during the synthesis, yet dominant cyan or green luminescence related to the presence of Eu  2+  ions was observed instead, respectively. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at 10 K revealed that this intrinsically occurring reduction could be clearly correlated to the presence of impurity&#8208;localized color centers.

      <title>Superoxide dismutase 1 in health and disease: How a front&#8208;line antioxidant becomes neurotoxic</title>
      <dc:description>Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a front&#8208;line antioxidant enzyme catalysing superoxide breakdown and is important for most forms of eukaryotic life. The evolution of aerobic respiration by mitochondria increased cellular production of superoxide, resulting in an increased reliance upon SOD1.

      <title>Enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction activity of platinum electrodes in alkaline media using Ni&#8208;Fe clusters</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we demonstrate an easy way to improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt electrodes in alkaline media by introducing Ni&#8208;Fe clusters. As a result, the overpotential needed to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8209;2 in H2&#8208;saturated 0.1 M KOH is reduced for the model single crystal electrodes down to ~70 mV. To the best of our knowledge, these modified electrodes outperform any other reported electrocatalysts tested under similar conditions. Moreover, the influence of (i) Ni to Fe ratio, (ii) cluster coverage, and (iii) the nature of the alkali metal cations present in the electrolyte on the HER activity has been investigated. The observed catalytic performance likely originates from both the improved water dissociation at the Ni&#8208;Fe clusters and the subsequent optimal hydrogen adsorption and recombination at Pt atoms present at the Ni&#8208;Fe/Pt boundary</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Quinoline&#8208;Malononitrile Core as a Building Block for the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of AIEgens</title>
      <dc:description>
In this minireview, recent advances related to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) building block quinoline&#8208;malononitrile are summarized. The review focuses on the AIE mechanism, regulation of emission wavelength and morphology, the facile scale&#8208;up and fast preparation for AIE nanoparticles, and potential biomedical imaging applications.







Abstract
In&#8197;vivo fluorescent monitoring of physiological processes with high&#8208;fidelity is essential in disease diagnosis and biological research, but faces extreme challenges due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and short&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. The development of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores is in high demand for precise optical bioimaging. The chromophore quinoline&#8208;malononitrile (QM) has recently emerged as a new class of AIE building block that possesses several notable features, such as red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, high brightness, marked photostability, and good biocompatibility. In this minireview, we summarize some recent advances of our established AIE building block of QM, focusing on the AIE mechanism, regulation of emission wavelength and morphology, the facile scale&#8208;up and fast preparation for AIE nanoparticles, as well as potential biomedical imaging applications.

In this minireview, we summarize some recent advances of our established AIE building block of QM, focusing on the AIE mechanism, regulation of emission wavelength and morphology, the facile scale&#8208;up and fast preparation for AIE nanoparticles, as well as potential biomedical imaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planar AIEgens with Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence and ROS Generation for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
Planar luminophores with excellent aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation properties that are based on intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions can serve as photosensitizers in the photodynamic therapy of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Planar luminogens have encountered difficulties in overcoming intrinsic aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching by intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Although excited&#8208;state double&#8208;bond reorganization (ESDBR) can guide us on designing planar aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens), its mechanism has yet been elucidated. Major challenges in the field include methods to efficiently restrict ESDBR and enhance AIE performance without using bulky substituents (e.g., tetraphenylethylene and triphenylamine). In this study, we rationally developed fluoro&#8208;substituent AIEgens with stronger intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction for restricted molecular motions and increased crystal density, leading to decreased nonradiative decay rate by one order of magnitude. The adjusted ESDBR properties also show a corresponding response to variation in viscosity. Furthermore, their aggregation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations have been discovered. The application of such planar AIEgen in treating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria has been demonstrated in a mouse model. The relationship between ROS generation and distinct E/Z&#8208;configurational stacking behaviors have been further understood, providing a design principle for synthesizing planar AIEgen&#8208;based photosensitizers.

      <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Cycling for Multiplexed Cellular Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Gravitationally enhanced? Black hole quenchers (BHQ) interact with fluorophores to accelerate tetrazine/trans&#8208;cyclooctene (Tz/TCO) click reactions by more than three orders of magnitude. Cells stained with fluorophore&#8208;TCO labeled antibodies (FAST probes) can be efficiently quenched in seconds with a BHQ3&#8208;Tz, eliminating time&#8208;consuming bleaching/cleavage steps and enabling rapid cellular analyses for cancer diagnostics.







Abstract
Rapid analysis of single and scant cell populations is essential in modern diagnostics, yet existing methods are often limited and slow. Herein, we describe an ultra&#8208;fast, highly efficient cycling method for the analysis of single cells based on unique linkers for tetrazine (Tz)/trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8208;mediated quenching. Surprisingly, the quenching reaction rates were more than 3 orders of magnitude faster (t1/2 &lt;1&#8197;s) than predicted. This allowed multi&#8208;cycle staining and immune cell profiling within an hour, leveraging the accelerated kinetics to open new diagnostic possibilities for rapid cellular analyses.

      <title>CAAC&#8208;Based Thiele and Schlenk Hydrocarbons</title>
      <dc:description>
Doubly radical: The p&#8208; and m&#8208;phenylene bridged bis&#8208;pyrrolinium cations A provide access to cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) analogues of Thiele's hydrocarbon (B), a Kekul&#233; diradical, and to Schlenk's hydrocarbon (C), a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical, respectively. B has a singlet ground state. C has two unpaired electrons in the ground state and forms a dimer by an intermolecular double head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization.







Abstract
Diradicals have been of tremendous interest for over a century ever since the first reports of p&#8208; and m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged diphenylmethylradicals in 1904 by Thiele and 1915 by Schlenk. Reported here are the first examples of cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) analogues of Thiele's hydrocarbon, a Kekul&#233; diradical, and Schlenk's hydrocarbon, a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical, without using CAAC as a precursor. The CAAC analogue of Thiele's hydrocarbon has a singlet ground state, whereas the CAAC analogue of Schlenk's hydrocarbon contains two unpaired electrons. The latter forms a dimer, by an intermolecular double head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization. This straightforward synthetic methodology is modular and can be extended for the generation of redox&#8208;active organic compounds.

      <title>Harnessing Endogenous Formate for Antibacterial Prodrug Activation via in cellulo Ruthenium&#8208;mediated&#160;Transfer Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The abundance and evolving pathogenic behavior of bacterial microorganisms give rise to antibiotic tolerance and resistance which pose a danger to global public health. New therapeutic strategies are needed to keep pace with this growing threat. We propose a novel approach of targeting bacteria by harnessing formate, a cell metabolite found only in particular bacterial species, to activate an antibacterial prodrug and selectively inhibit their growth. This strategy is premised on transfer hydrogenation (TFH) reaction on a biorthogonal substrate utilizing native formate as the hydride source as a means of uncaging an antibacterial prodrug. Using coordination&#8208;directed 3&#8208;component assembly (C3A) to prepare a library of 768 unique Ru&#8208;Arene Schiff&#8208;base (RAS) complexes, we identified several candidates that efficiently reduced sulfonyl azide functional group in the presence of formate. We further designed a caged compound based on antibacterial agent sulfanilamide containing a sulfonyl azide group in place of sulfonamide as a prodrug. The lead RAS complex triggered prodrug activation in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which evolved multiple formate biosynthesis pathways, but not Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis), with limited formate biosynthesis capacity, nor mammalian cells, which are deficient in endogenous formate. This strategy paves the way for a new approach of targeted antibacterial therapy by exploiting unique bacterial metabolites.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme Mimetic Active Intermediates for Nitrate Reduction in Neutral Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrate is a pervasive aquatic contaminant of global environmental concern.

      <title>A General Strategy for Macrotheranostic Prodrug Activation: Synergy between the Acidic Tumor Microenvironment and Bioorthogonal Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal prodrug activation: A strategy for prodrug activation was developed that uses the acidic tumor microenvironment and a bioorthogonal click reaction. A tetrazine&#8208;functionalized pH&#8208;sensitive polymer micelle disassembles in the acidic tumor microenvironment, exposing the tetrazine groups that activate the prodrug. Prodrug activation is confirmed by a NIR fluorescence signal and the restoration of phototoxicity in the tumor.







Abstract
Prodrugs activated by endogenous stimuli face the problem of tumor heterogeneity. Bioorthogonal prodrug activation that utilizes an exogenous click reaction has the potential to solve this problem, but most of the strategies currently used rely on the presence of endogenous receptors or overexpressed enzymes. We herein integrate the acidic, extracellular microenvironment of a tumor and a click reaction as a general strategy for prodrug activation. This was achieved by using a tumor pH&#8208;responsive polymer containing tetrazine groups, which formed unreactive micelles in the blood but disassembled in response to tumor pH. The vinyl ether group on the macrotheranostic prodrug (CyPVE) is activated by the tetrazine groups, which was confirmed by tumor&#8208;specific fluorescence activation and phototoxicity restoration. Therefore, the bioorthogonal reactions in the context of the ubiquitous acidic tumor microenvironment can provide a general strategy for bioorthogonal prodrug activation.

      <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Copper(I)/NHC Complexes: Dual Emission Properties and Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Two CuI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes were designed and they demonstrated dual emission properties. A series of spectral, crystal, and theoretical studies proved the novel luminescence nature of the locally excited state in the complexes. Ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission of 140&#8197;ms and a total photoluminescence quantum yield of 36.3&#8201;% were achieved by selective deuteration of the carbazole group.







Abstract
As a kind of photoluminescent material, CuI complexes have many advantages such as adjustable emission, variable structures, and low cost, attracting attention in many fields. In this work, two novel two&#8208;coordinate CuI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes were synthesized, and they exhibit unique dual emission properties, fluorescence and phosphorescence. The crystal structure, packing mode, and photophysical properties under different conditions were systematically studied, proving the emissive mechanism to be the locally excited state of the carbazole group. Based on this mechanism, ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with a lifetime of 140&#8197;ms is achieved by selective deuteration of the carbazole group. These results deepen the understanding of the luminescence mechanism and design strategy for two&#8208;coordinate CuI complexes, and prove their potential in applications as ultralong RTP materials.

      <title>Efficient and Stable Thin&#8208;Film Luminescent Solar Concentrators Enabled by Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
TPP for LSCs: A triphenylphosphine (TPP) post&#8208;treatment method was demonstrated for the preparation of highly stable, large&#8208;area CsPbI3 nanocrystal&#8211;polymer composite thin&#8208;film luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). They have a high optical conversion efficiency and are highly emissive (absolute PLQY ca. 100&#8201;%).







Abstract
A novel triphenylphosphine (TPP) treatment strategy was developed to prepare the near&#8208;infrared emission CsPbI3 nanocrystal (NC)&#8208;polymer composite thin&#8208;film luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) featuring high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), low reabsorption, and high stability. The PL emission of the LSCs is centered at about 700&#8197;nm with 99.4&#177;0.4&#8201;% PLQY and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 75&#8197;meV (30&#8197;nm). Compared with LSCs prepared with classic CsPbI3 NCs, the stability of the LSCs after TPP treatments has been greatly improved, even after long&#8208;term (30&#8197;days) immersion in water and strong mercury&#8208;lamp irradiation (50&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Owing to the presence of lone&#8208;pair electrons on the phosphorus atom, TPP is also used as a photoinitiator, with higher efficiency than other common photoinitiators. Large&#8208;area (ca. 75&#8197;cm2) infrared LSCs were achieved with a high optical conversion efficiency of 3.1&#8201;% at a geometric factor of 10.

      <title>An Unprecedented Antimony(III) Borate with Strong Linear and Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
An antimony(III) borate, SbB3O6, has been synthesized. It exhibits not only a linear optical response (&#916;n=0.290 @ 546&#8197;nm), which is the largest among borates, but also a strong nonlinear optical response (SGH=3.5&#215;KH2PO4) that exceeds most borates.







Abstract
Antimony(III) borates with a stereochemical active lone pair remained unknown, although the first antimony borate was reported more than twenty years ago. Now, the first antimony(III) borate in a closed system is successfully synthesized, namely SbB3O6. Remarkably, SbB3O6 not only exhibits an exceptional linear optical response, that is, birefringence of &#916;n=0.290 at the wavelength of 546&#8197;nm, which is the largest among borates, but also has a strong nonlinear optical response of 3.5 times larger than the benchmark KH2PO4, exceeding those of most borates. Theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of strong linear and nonlinear optical responses in SbB3O6 should be attributable to the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;conjugated B&#8722;O anionic groups and Sb3+ with stereochemically active lone pair. This work provides a new class of optical bi&#8208;functional materials with potential prospects in integrated optical devices.

This first application of FRET between an isomorphic nucleobase donor and an intrinsically fluorogenic ligand revealed position&#8208;dependent quantum yields and FRET efficiencies for mapping of the ligand binding site.







Abstract
RNA aptamers form compact tertiary structures and bind their ligands in specific binding sites. Fluorescence&#8208;based strategies reveal information on structure and dynamics of RNA aptamers. Herein, we report the incorporation of the universal emissive nucleobase analog 4&#8208;cyanoindole into the fluorogenic RNA aptamer Chili, and its application as a donor for supramolecular FRET to the bound ligands DMHBI+ or DMHBO+. The photophysical properties of the new nucleobase&#8211;ligand&#8208;FRET pair revealed structural restraints for the overall RNA aptamer organization and identified nucleotide positions suitable for FRET&#8208;based readout of ligand binding. This strategy is generally suitable for binding&#8208;site mapping and may also be applied for responsive aptamer devices.

      <title>A Universal Strategy toward Ultrasmall Hollow Nanostructures with Remarkable Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy is developed to fabricate ultrasmall hollow nanostructures by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene.







Abstract
A facile and versatile microwave&#8208;assisted and shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy is used to fabricate ultrasmall hollow nanoparticles by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene. This method involves that the adsorption of microwave by graphene creates a high&#8208;energy environment in a short time to decompose the in&#8197;situ grown MOF nanocrystals into well&#8208;dispersed uniform core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with ultrasmall size. Upon a shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion process, hollow nanoparticles of multi&#8208;metal oxides, phosphides, and sulfides with the diameter below 20&#8197;nm and shell thickness below 3&#8197;nm can be obtained for the first time. Ultrasmall hollow nanostructures such as Fe2O3 can promote much faster charge transport and expose more active sites as well as migrate the volume change stress more efficiently than the solid and large hollow counterparts, thus demonstrating remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage performance.

Abstract
A facile method to oxidatively trimerize phenols using a catalytic aerobic copper system is described. The mechanism of this transformation was probed, yielding insight that enabled cross&#8208;coupling trimerizations. With this method, the natural product pyrolaside&#8197;B was synthesized for the first time.

      <title>Systemic Brain Delivery of Antisense Oligonucleotides across the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier with a Glucose&#8208;Coated Polymeric Nanocarrier</title>
      <dc:description>
The sweet spot: Antisense&#8208;oligonucleotide&#8208;loaded glucosylated&#8208;polyion&#8208;complex micelles can be used for RNA knockdown in various brain regions using blood&#8208;glucose level as an external trigger. Glucose transporter&#8208;1 expressed on the brain capillary endothelial cells binds the glucose&#8208;coated nanocarrier and transports it, along with its cargo, across the blood&#8211;brain barrier. This could be used for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system.







Abstract
Current antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders are performed through invasive administration, thereby placing a major burden on patients. To alleviate this burden, we herein report systemic ASO delivery to the brain by crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier using glycemic control as an external trigger. Glucose&#8208;coated polymeric nanocarriers, which can be bound by glucose transporter&#8208;1 expressed on the brain capillary endothelial cells, are designed for stable encapsulation of ASOs, with a particle size of about 45&#8197;nm and an adequate glucose&#8208;ligand density. The optimized nanocarrier efficiently accumulates in the brain tissue 1&#8197;h after intravenous administration and exhibits significant knockdown of a target long non&#8208;coding RNA in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These results demonstrate that the glucose&#8208;modified polymeric nanocarriers enable noninvasive ASO administration to the brain for the treatment of CNS disorders.

      <title>Activation of Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalysts by Loading with Ultrafine Rh&#8211;Cr Mixed&#8208;Oxide Cocatalyst Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles with a size of approximately 1.3&#8197;nm were loaded onto a BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst. The photocatalyst exhibited the highest quantum yield reported for BaLa4Ti4O15. The developed preparation technique of Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles is also expected to improve the activity of other advanced water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts. SG=glutathionate.







Abstract
The activity of many water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts could be improved by the use of RhIII&#8211;CrIII mixed oxide (Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3) particles as cocatalysts. Although further improvement of water&#8208;splitting activity could be achieved if the size of the Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles was decreased further, it is difficult to load ultrafine (&lt;2&#8197;nm) Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles onto a photocatalyst by using conventional loading methods. In this study, a new loading method was successfully established and was used to load Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles with a size of approximately 1.3&#8197;nm and a narrow size distribution onto a BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst. The obtained photocatalyst exhibited an apparent quantum yield of 16&#8201;%, which is the highest achieved for BaLa4Ti4O15 to date. Thus, the developed loading technique of Rh2&#8722;xCrxO3 particles is extremely effective at improving the activity of the water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst BaLa4Ti4O15. This method is expected to be extended to other advanced water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts to achieve higher quantum yields.

      <title>Development of Chiral Organosuperbase Catalysts Consisting of Two Different Organobase Functionalities</title>

Chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts, which consist of a P2&#8208;phosphazene as an organosuperbase and a chiral guanidine as a hydrogen bond donor for substrate recognition, were developed based on a novel concept for a distinctive cooperative function by two organobases in a single catalyst molecule. The prominent catalytic activity was demonstrated in the enantioselective direct Mannich&#8208;type reaction of less acidic &#945;&#8208;phenylthioacetate.







Abstract
In the field of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, a new generation of chiral catalysts has been highly anticipated to overcome the intrinsic limitation of pronucleophiles that are applicable to the enantioselective reactions. Herein, we reveal conceptually new chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts consisting of two different organobase functionalities, one of which functions as an organosuperbase and the other as the substrate recognition site. Their prominent activity, which stems from the distinctive cooperative function by the two organobases in a single catalyst molecule, was demonstrated in the unprecedented enantioselective direct Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;&#8208;phenylthioacetate as a less acidic pronucleophile. The present achievement would provide a new guiding principle for the design and development of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts and significantly broaden the utility of Br&#248;nsted base catalysis in asymmetric organic synthesis.

      <title>Label&#8208;Free Imaging of Intracellular Temperature by Using the O&#8722;H Stretching Raman Band of Water</title>
      <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for imaging intracellular and extracellular temperatures using the O&#8722;H stretching Raman band of water is proposed. The method is based on changes in the O&#8722;H band shape with temperature. The shown image of the temperature changes after adding a mitochondrial uncoupling agent to a cell was obtained in a label&#8208;free manner.







Abstract
We propose a label&#8208;free method for measuring intracellular temperature using a Raman image of a cell in the O&#8722;H stretching band. Raman spectra of cultured cells and the medium were first measured at various temperatures using a Raman microscope and the intensity ratio of the two regions of the O&#8722;H stretching band was calculated. The intensity ratio varies linearly with temperature in both the medium and cells, and the resulting calibration lines allow simultaneous visualization of both intracellular and extracellular temperatures in a label&#8208;free manner. We applied this method to the measurement of temperature changes after the introduction of FCCP (carbonyl cyanide&#8208;p&#8208;trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) in living cells. We observed a temperature rise in the cytoplasm and succeeded in obtaining an image of the change in intracellular temperature after the FCCP treatment.

      <title>Dimensional Matching versus Induced&#8208;Fit Distortions: Binding Affinities of Planar and Curved Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons with a Tetragold Metallorectangle</title>
      <dc:description>
Corannulene and a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage mutually adapt their shapes to maximize shape complementarity upon formation of a host&#8211;guest complex.







Abstract
A tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage containing two pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands and two carbazolyl&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl linkers is used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including corannulene. The binding affinities obtained for the encapsulation of the planar PAHs guests in CD2Cl2 are found to exponentially increase with the number of &#960;&#8208;electrons of the guest (1.3 &gt; logK &gt;6.6). For the bowl&#8208;shaped molecule of corannulene, the association constant is much lower than the expected one according to its number of electrons. The molecular structure of the host&#8211;guest complex formed with corannulene shows that the molecule of the guest is compressed, while the host is expanded, thus showing an interesting case of artificial mutual induced&#8208;fit arrangement.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corannulene&lt;/b&gt; and a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage mutually adapt their shapes to maximize shape complementarity upon formation of a host&#8211;guest complex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallocage containing two pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands and two carbazolyl&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl linkers is used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including corannulene. The binding affinities obtained for the encapsulation of the planar PAHs guests in CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are found to exponentially increase with the number of &#960;&#8208;electrons of the guest (1.3 &amp;gt; log&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;6.6). For the bowl&#8208;shaped molecule of corannulene, the association constant is much lower than the expected one according to its number of electrons. The molecular structure of the host&#8211;guest complex formed with corannulene shows that the molecule of the guest is compressed, while the host is expanded, thus showing an interesting case of artificial mutual induced&#8208;fit arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enhanced Propene/Propane Separation by Directional Decoration of the 12&#8208;Membered Rings of Mordenite with ZIF Fragments</title>
      <dc:description>
Separation of the unseparable: The 12&#8208;membered rings of mordenite (MOR) zeolite were directionally decorated with ZIF fragments. The resulting material shows greatly improved propene/propane separation performance.







Abstract
Propene/propane separation is challenging due to the very small difference in molecular sizes, boiling points and condensabilities between these molecules. Herein, we report a strategy of introducing ZIF fragments into traditional mordenite (MOR) zeolite to decorate the 12&#8208;membered ring of MOR. After decoration, the originally ineffective zeolite MOR exhibited high kinetic propene/propane selectivities (139 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and achieved efficient propene/propane separation. The propene/propane separation potentials of the resulting adsorbents were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments with equimolar propene/propane (50/50) mixtures.

      <title>MDM2&#8208;Associated Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission and Apoptosis Induction Effectuated by a Theranostic Spiropolymer</title>
      <dc:description>
A spiropolymer (P1a2b, see picture) demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction, P1a2b triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;containing spiropolymers were constructed in a facile manner by a catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent spiropolymerization route. P1a2b as the most potent of these spiropolymers, demonstrates cluster&#8208;triggered emission resulting from strong interactions with the MDM2 protein. By preventing the anti&#8208;apoptotic p53/MDM2 interaction, P1a2b triggers apoptosis in cancerous cells, while demonstrating a good biocompatibility and non&#8208;toxicity in non&#8208;cancerous cells. The combined results from solution and cell&#8208;based cluster&#8208;triggered emission studies, docking, protein expression experiments and cytotoxicity data strongly support the MDM2&#8208;binding hypothesis and indicate a potential application as a fluorescent cancer marker as well as therapeutic for this spiropolymer.

      <title>A Boron Nitride Nanosheets Composite Membrane for a Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Based Flow Battery</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with high thermal conductivity and mechanical strength are introduced onto a porous membrane substrate to induce dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition and further enable a long&#8208;life zinc&#8208;based flow battery.







Abstract
The capability to maintain a constant system temperature is vital in nature, since it endows the system with enhanced lifetime. This trait also works for zinc&#8208;based batteries, because their cycle&#8208;life is limited by notorious zinc dendrite/accumulation, which are highly affected by the inhomogeneous distribution of temperature on electrode and relatively low mechanical strength of membrane. Herein, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with high mechanical strength serving as heat&#8208;porter are introduced onto a porous substrate to enable uniform deposition of zinc and further a zinc&#8208;based flow battery with long&#8208;cycle life. The results indicate that BNNSs can effectively adjust the deposited zinc from needle&#8208;like to French fries&#8208;like morphology, thus affording the battery with a stable performance for nearly 500 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Most importantly, an energy efficiency of above 80&#8201;% can be obtained even at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc&#8208;based flow batteries.

      <title>Manganese&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Quantum Confinement within Host Perovskite Nanocrystals through Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Defects</title>
      <dc:description>
The doping of Mn2+ ions into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (NCs) strongly influences the excitonic properties of the host NCs. Manganese doping leads to the formation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper defects and thus induces quantum confinement within individual crystals. This results in a blue shift of the excitonic emission.







Abstract
The concept of doping Mn2+ ions into II&#8211;VI semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) was recently extended to perovskite NCs. To date, most studies on Mn2+ doped NCs focus on enhancing the emission related to the Mn2+ dopant via an energy transfer mechanism. Herein, we found that the doping of Mn2+ ions into CsPbCl3 NCs not only results in a Mn2+&#8208;related orange emission, but also strongly influences the excitonic properties of the host NCs. We observe for the first time that Mn2+ doping leads to the formation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R.P.) defects and thus induces quantum confinement within the host NCs. We find that a slight doping with Mn2+ ions improves the size distribution of the NCs, which results in a prominent excitonic peak. However, with increasing the Mn2+ concentration, the number of R.P. planes increases leading to smaller single&#8208;crystal domains. The thus enhanced confinement and crystal inhomogeneity cause a gradual blue shift and broadening of the excitonic transition, respectively.

      <dc:description>
Pass it on: Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [4+1] spiroannulation of nitrones and ortho&#8208;quinone diazides has been realized for the enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclic 3H&#8208;indole N&#8208;oxides by merging C&#8722;H activation with axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.







Abstract
Axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer is an important strategy to construct chiral centers, where the axially chiral reagents are mostly limited to atropomerically stable ones. Reported herein is a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective spiroannulative synthesis of nitrones. The coupling proceeds via C&#8722;H arylation to give an atropomerically metastable biaryl, followed by intramolecular dearomative trapping under oxidative conditions with high degree of chirality transfer.

Two multifunctional, chiral [Au(NHC)2][Au(CN)2] (NHC=(4R,5R)/(4S,5S)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) complex double salts display Ex&#8208;De circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in doped polymer films and in ground powder. Emission maxima can be dynamically tuned from 440 to 530&#8197;nm by changing the excitation wavelength. The continuously tunable photoluminescence is proposed to originate from multiple emissive excited states as a result of the existence of varied AuI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AuI distances in ground state. The steric properties of the NHC ligand are crucial to the tuning of AuI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AuI distances. An anti&#8208;counterfeiting application using these two salts is demonstrated.

      <title>A Modular Synthetic Strategy for Functional Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>
Play with Lego: A modular synthetic strategy for macrocycles with functional skeletons was demonstrated, involving one&#8208;pot and high&#8208;yielding condensation between bis(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)arene monomers and paraformaldehyde. By changing the blocks, variously functional units can be conveniently introduced into the backbone of macrocycles.







Abstract
Reported here is a molecule&#8208;Lego synthetic strategy for macrocycles with functional skeletons, involving one&#8208;pot and high&#8208;yielding condensation between bis(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)arene monomers and paraformaldehyde. By changing the blocks, variously functional units (naphthalene, pyrene, anthraquinone, porphyrin, etc.) can be conveniently introduced into the backbone of macrocycles. Interestingly, the macrocyclization can be tuned by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. Linear (180&#176;) monomer yield cyclic trimers and pentamers, while V&#8208;shaped (120&#176;, 90&#176; and 60&#176;) monomers tend to form dimers. More significantly, even heterogeneous macrocycles are obtained in moderate yield by co&#8208;oligomerization of different monomers. This series of macrocycles have the potential to be prosperous in the near future.

      <title>Multifunctional AuI&#8208;based AIEgens: Manipulating Molecular Structures and Boosting Specific Cancer Cell Imaging and Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;AuI complex was investigated by elaborate structural tailoring and systematic biological evaluation. It could simultaneously achieve specific imaging and inhibition of various cancer cells with negligible toxic effects on normal cells and act as a powerful radiosensitizer to boost anticancer efficacy.







Abstract
Gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (AuI&#8208;NHC) complexes have emerged as potential anticancer agents owing to their high cytotoxicity and stability. Integration of their above unique functions with customized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens to achieve specific bioimaging and efficient theranostics to cancer is highly desirable but is rarely studied. Now, a series of novel AuI&#8208;NHC compounds were developed with AIE characteristics. A complex with a PPh3 ligand was selected out as it could achieve both prominent specific imaging of various cancer cells and efficient inhibition of their growth with negligible toxic effects on normal cells due to the targeting binding and strong inhibition towards thioredoxin reductase. This complex could also act as a powerful radiosensitizer to boost the anticancer efficacy with performance superior to that of popularly used auranofin. It holds great potential as a specific and effective theranostic drug in cancer diagnosis and precise therapy.

      <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of NBN&#8208;Doped Zigzag&#8208;Edged Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represents an attractive strategy for the modulation of GNRs with tailor&#8208;made electronic properties. The rational bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategies used thus far for zigzag&#8208;edged GNRs (ZGNRs) are limited due to their highly unstable characteristics. We report herein the first bottom&#8208;up synthesis of nitrogen&#8722;boron&#8722;nitrogen (NBN)&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged GNRs (  NBN&#8208;ZGNR1  and  NBN&#8208;ZGNR2  ) through surface&#8208;assisted polymerization and cyclodehydrogenation based on two U&#8208;shaped molecular precursors (  M1  and  M2  ) with an NBN unit preinstalled at the zigzag edge. The resultant zigzag edge topologies of GNRs are elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electronic structures of  NBN&#8208;ZGNR1  (1.50 eV, 37% zigzag edge proportion) and  NBN&#8208;ZGNR2  (0.90 eV, 57% zigzag edge proportion) are significantly different from those of their corresponding pristine fully carbon&#8208;based ZGNRs (  PCZGNR1  : 0.52 eV;  PCZGNR2  : 0.27 eV). In addition, DFT calculations predict that the electronic structures of  NBN&#8208;ZGNRs  can be further tailored to be gapless (zero bandgap) and metallic, respectively, through one&#8208;electron oxidation of each NBN unit into the corresponding radical cations. This work reported herein provides a feasible strategy for the synthesis of GNRs with stable zigzag edges yet tunable electronic properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Activatable Molecular Probes for Second Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence, Chemiluminescence, and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Optical imaging plays a crucial role in biomedicine.

To enable specific disease detection, a number of activatable molecular probes (AMPs) with the ability to change their second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or photoacoustic signals in response to the biomarker of interest have been developed. These AMPs permit the deep&#8208;tissue imaging of biomarkers with high signal specificity and sensitivity.

The nature of these photochromatic images colours motivated a debate between scientists during the 19  th  century, which is still not settled. We present the results of chemical analysis (EDX, HAXPES and EXAFS) and morphology studies (SEM, STEM) aiming at explaining the optical properties of the photochromatic images (UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and low loss EELS). We rule out the two hypotheses (pigment and interferences) that have prevailed since 1848, respectively based on variations in the oxidation degree of the compound forming the sensitized layer and periodically spaced photolytic silver planes. A study of the silver nanoparticles dispersions contained in the coloured layers showed specific localizations and size distributions of the nanoparticles for each colour. These results allow us to formulate a plasmonic hypothesis on the origin of the photochromatic images colours.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Oxynitride K2LaTa2O6N with an H+/K+&#160;Exchangeability in Aqueous Solution to Form Stable Photocatalyst for Visible&#8208;Light H2&#160;Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) undoped layered perovskite oxynitride materials have been suggested as potential visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts; however, there have been few investigations on their use as photocatalysts because of the difficulty in synthesis and stability issues when in contact with water. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a new layered perovskite oxynitride, K2LaTa2O6N, as an exceptional example of a water&#8208;tolerant photocatalyst for H2&#160;evolution under visible light. K2LaTa2O6N, prepared from KLaTa2O7&#160;and K2CO3&#160;as precursors, underwent in situ H+/K+&#160;exchange in aqueous solution while keeping its visible light absorption capability. Thus protonated K2LaTa2O6N, K2&#8211;xHxLaTa2O6N, modified with an Ir cocatalyst, exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward H2&#160;evolution in the presence of I&#8211;&#160;as an electron donor and under visible light irradiation; the activity was 6 times higher than Pt/ZrO2/TaON, one of the best&#8208;performing oxynitride photocatalysts for H2&#160;evolution. Overall water splitting was also achieved using the Ir&#8208;loaded, protonated K2LaTa2O6N in combination with Cs&#8208;modified Pt/WO3&#160;as an O2&#160;evolution photocatalyst in the presence of I3&#8211;/I&#8211;&#160;shuttle redox couple. Undoped layered oxynitrides have not been considered promising for H2&#160;evolution, owing to the low chemical stability of the oxynitrides in aqueous solution. However, the present study is expected to stimulate further research on related materials for application in solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropanes: Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Pseudotransannular Desymmetrization</title>
      <dc:description>
The chiral phosphoric acid VAPOL (green) catalyzes pseudotransannular epoxide ring opening on meso&#8208;cycloalkenylamine&#8208;derived epoxides to deliver highly enantioenriched tropanol derivatives in a single step through a very efficient desymmetrization process. This strategy was applied to the total synthesis of the two naturally occurring alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tropanol and (+)&#8208;ferruginine.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of tropanols has been accomplished through chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed pseudotransannular ring opening of 1&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;derived epoxides. The reaction proceeds together with the desymmetrization of the starting material and leads to the direct formation of the 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold with excellent stereoselectivity. The synthetic applicability of the reaction was demonstrated by the enantioselective synthesis of the two natural products (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tropanol and (+)&#8208;ferruginine.

      <title>Polyketide Cyclizations for the Synthesis of Polyaromatics</title>
      <dc:description>
The folding and cyclization of polyketide chains precisely control the divergent biosynthesis of structurally distinct aromatic natural products. In this Minireview, the virtues of transferring this biosynthetic concept into the assembly of polyaromatics is outlined. The prospects of emerging divergent cyclizations controlled by small&#8208;molecule catalysts are highlighted.







Abstract
The folding and cyclization of poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbonyl chains controlled by the intricate enzymatic polyketide synthase machinery results in a remarkable diversity of aromatic natural products. Synthetic methods that allow for the preparation of highly reactive polyketide chains while governing their folding in ensuing cyclizations likewise lead to versatile divergent preparations of aromatic scaffolds valuable for numerous applications. Although biomimetic polyketide cyclizations have repeatedly been applied in the total synthesis of polyphenol natural products, their utility for the preparation of the broad range of polyaromatic architectures has yet to reach its full potential. This Minireview highlights some of the virtues of applying polyketide logic to the retrosynthetic analysis of polycyclic aromatic scaffolds, the increasing accessibility of precursors, and the potential of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for controlling polyketide cyclizations to provide polyaromatic scaffolds.

      <title>Stable Radical Cation and Dication of an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Stabilized Digallene: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Something radical: The first stable gallium&#8208;based radical cation and dication synthesized from one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidations, respectively, of a digallene stabilized by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) have been isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
One&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation of a digallene stabilized by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene afforded the first stable gallium&#8208;based radical cation and dication salts, respectively. Structural analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxidation occurs at the Ga=Ga double bond, leading to removal of &#960; electrons of the double bond and a decrease of the bond order. The spin density of the radical cation mainly locates at the two gallium centers as demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Moreover, the reactivity of the radical cation salt toward nBu3SnH and cyclo&#8208;S8 was studied; a digallium&#8211;hydride cation salt containing a Ga&#8722;Ga single bond and a gallium sulfide cluster bearing an unprecedented ladder&#8208;like Ga4S4 core structure were obtained, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Something radical&lt;/b&gt;: The first stable gallium&#8208;based radical cation and dication synthesized from one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidations, respectively, of a digallene stabilized by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) have been isolated and structurally characterized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation of a digallene stabilized by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene afforded the first stable gallium&#8208;based radical cation and dication salts, respectively. Structural analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxidation occurs at the Ga=Ga double bond, leading to removal of &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; electrons of the double bond and a decrease of the bond order. The spin density of the radical cation mainly locates at the two gallium centers as demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Moreover, the reactivity of the radical cation salt toward &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SnH and cyclo&#8208;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; was studied; a digallium&#8211;hydride cation salt containing a Ga&#8722;Ga single bond and a gallium sulfide cluster bearing an unprecedented ladder&#8208;like Ga&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core structure were obtained, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates by Stereoselective Copolymerization of Racemic Diolides: Stereocontrol and Polyolefin&#8208;Like Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Stereoselective synthesis: The chemical synthesis of biodegradable polymers is presented. Stereoselective copolymerization of racemic diolides by chiral metal&#8208;based catalysts rapidly produces high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight, crystalline, isotactic polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) exhibiting polyolefin&#8208;like thermal and mechanical properties.







Abstract
Bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of biodegradable polymers because of their biodegradability in ambient environments and structural diversity enabled by side&#8208;chain groups. However, the biosynthesis of PHAs is slow and expensive, limiting their broader applications as commodity plastics. To overcome such limitation, the catalyzed chemical synthesis of bacterial PHAs has been developed, using the metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerization of racemic cyclic diolides (rac&#8208;8DLR, R=alkyl group). In this combined experimental and computational study, polymerization kinetics, stereocontrol, copolymerization characteristics, and the properties of the resulting PHAs have been examined. Most notably, stereoselective copolymerizations of rac&#8208;8DLMe with rac&#8208;8DLR (R=Et, Bu) have yielded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight, crystalline isotactic PHA copolymers that are hard, ductile, and tough plastics, and exhibit polyolefin&#8208;like thermal and mechanical properties.

      <title>Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement Controlled by Optical Manipulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A focused laser beam traps a single aggregate of a protonated tetraphenylethene derivative, and the manipulation of the molecular structure in the aggregate is achieved by overcoming the repulsion force between the molecules, activating its aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE). The bright yellow fluorescence from the aggregate can be controlled through the laser power.







Abstract
We present spatiotemporal control of aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of a protonated tetraphenylethene derivative by optical manipulation. A single submicrometer&#8208;sized aggregate is initially confined by laser irradiation when its fluorescence is hardly detectable. The continuous irradiation of the formed aggregate leads to sudden and rapid growth, resulting in bright yellow fluorescence emission. The fluorescence intensity at the peak wavelength of 540&#8197;nm is tremendously enhanced with growth, meaning that AIEE is activated by optical manipulation. Amazingly, the switching on/off of the activation of AIEE is arbitrarily controlled by alternating the laser power. This result means that optical manipulation increases the local concentration, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated molecules, namely, optical manipulation changes the aggregate structure. The dynamics and mechanism in AIEE controlled by optical manipulation will be discussed from the viewpoint of molecular conformation and association depending on the laser power.

      <title>Transformation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases into Glutamate Receptors and Photoreceptors</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical Umami: Through a combination of protein engineering and chemical synthesis, the human insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), was converted into a glutamate (red) receptor and then a photoreceptor. The resulting chimeric RTK (grey) can be used to exert optical control over the insulin signaling pathway. The same approach was also applied to the hepatocyte growth factor receptor.







Abstract
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are key regulators of cellular functions in metazoans. In vertebrates, RTKs are mostly activated by polypeptides but are not naturally sensitive to amino acids or light. Taking inspiration from Venus kinase receptors (VKRs), an atypical family of RTKs found in nature, we have transformed the human insulin (hIR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (hMET) into glutamate receptors by replacing their extracellular binding domains with the ligand&#8208;binding domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor type&#8197;2 (mGluR2). We then imparted light sensitivity through covalent attachment of a synthetic glutamate&#8208;based photoswitch via a self&#8208;labelling SNAP tag. By employing a Xenopus laevis oocyte kinase activity assay, we demonstrate how these chimeric RTKs, termed light&#8208;controlled human insulin receptor (LihIR) and light&#8208;controlled human MET receptor (LihMET), can be used to exert optical control over the insulin or MET signaling pathways. Our results outline a potentially general strategy to convert RTKs into photoreceptors.

      <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Color in a Single&#8208;Component Organic Molecular Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic sunset: A time&#8208;dependent afterglow color in a single&#8208;component organic molecular crystal was observed. It originates from well&#8208;separated, long&#8208;persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with different but comparable decay rates.







Abstract
An organic crystal of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (pCBP) exhibits time&#8208;dependent afterglow color from blue to orange over 1&#8197;s. Both experimental and computational data confirm that the color evolution results from well&#8208;separated, long&#8208;persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with different but comparable decay rates. TADF is enabled by a small S1&#8211;T1 energy gap of 0.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The good separation of TADF and RTP is due to a 11.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 difference in the S0 energies of the S1 and T1 structures, indicating that apart from the excited&#8208;state properties, tuning the ground state is also important for luminescence properties. This afterglow color evolution of pCBP allows its applications in anticounterfeiting and data encryption with high security levels.

      <title>Supramolecular Strategies for Controlling Reactivity within Confined Nanospace</title>
      <dc:description>Nanospaces are ubiquitous in the realm of biological systems and are of significant interest among supramolecular chemists. Understanding chemical behavior within nanospaces offers new perspectives on biological phenomena in Nature and opens the way to highly unusual and selective forms of catalysis. Supramolecular chemistry exploits weak, yet effective, intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ligand coordination, and the hydrophobic effect to assemble nano&#8208;sized molecular architectures, providing reactions with remarkable rate acceleration, substrate specificity, and product selectivity. In this minireview, we will focus on the strategies that supramolecular chemists use to emulate the efficiency of biological processes, and elucidate how chemical reactivity is efficiently controlled within well&#8208;defined nanospaces. Approaches such as orientation and proximity of substrate, transition state stabilization, and active site incorporation will be discussed.</dc:description>

Understanding chemical behavior within nanospaces offers new perspectives on biological phenomena in Nature and opens the way to highly unusual and selective forms of catalysis. Supramolecular chemistry exploits weak, yet effective, intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ligand coordination, and the hydrophobic effect to assemble nano&#8208;sized molecular architectures, providing reactions with remarkable rate acceleration, substrate specificity, and product selectivity. In this minireview, we will focus on the strategies that supramolecular chemists use to emulate the efficiency of biological processes, and elucidate how chemical reactivity is efficiently controlled within well&#8208;defined nanospaces. Approaches such as orientation and proximity of substrate, transition state stabilization, and active site incorporation will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Photophysical Study of Sensitization&#8208;Initiated Electron Transfer: Insights into the Mechanism of Photoredox Activity</title>
      <dc:description>The development of photocatalytic reactions has provided many novel opportunities to expand the scope of synthetic organic chemistry. In parallel with progress towards uncovering new reactivity, there is consensus that efforts focused on providing detailed mechanistic insight in order to uncover underlying excited&#8208;state reactions are essential to maximise formation of desired products. With this in mind, we have investigated the recently reported Sensitization&#8208;Initiated Electron Transfer (SenI&#8208;ET) reaction for C&#8208;H arylation of activated aryl halides. Using a variety of techniques, and in particular nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we are able to distinguish several characteristic signals from the excited state species involved in the reaction, and subsequent kinetic analysis under various conditions has facilitated a detailed insight into the likely reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Trishomoaromatic (B3N3Ph6)&#8208;Dianion: Characterization and Two&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Benzene, as a common aromatic compound, can be converted to an unstable antiaromatic 8&#960;&#8208;electron intermediate through two&#8208;electron reduction. However, as an isoelectronic equivalent of benzene, borazine (B 3  N 3  R 6  ) of weak aromaticity undergoes the totally different two&#8208;electron reduction to afford (B 3  N 3  R 6  ) 2&#8208;  homoaromatic compounds. Here we report the synthesis of homoaromatic (B 3  N 3  Ph 6  )&#8208;dianion by the reduction of B 3  N 3  Ph 6  with potassium or rubidium in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Theoretical investigation illustrates that two electrons delocalize over three boron atoms in (B 3  N 3  Ph 6  ) 2&#8208;  , which is formed by the geometric and orbital reorganization and exhibits (&#960;,&#963;)&#8208;mixed homoaromaticity. Moreover, (B 3  N 3  Ph 6  )&#8208;dianion can act as a robust 2 e  reductant for unsaturated compounds, such as anthracene, chalcone and tanshinones.

      <dc:description>Porous tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) single crystals, combining structural coherence and porous microstructure, would substantially improve the photoelectrochemical performance. The structural coherence would reduce the recombination of charge carriers and maintain excellent transport property while the porous microstructure would not only reduce photon scattering and but also facilitate surface reactions. Here we grow bulk&#8208;porous Ta  3  N  5  single crystals on an two centimeter scale with (002) , (023) and (041) facets, respectively, and show significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical performances. We show the preferential facet growth of porous crystals in a lattice reconstruction strategy in relation to lattice match and lattice channel.

      <dc:description>We introduce a new boron&#8208;doped cyclophane, the hexabora[1 6 ]cyclophane B6&#8208;FMes, in which six tricoordinate borane moieties alternate with short conjugated p&#8208;phenylene linkers. Exocyclic 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (FMes) groups serve not only to further withdraw electron density but at the same time sterically shield the boron atoms, resulting in a macrocycle that is both highly electron&#8208;deficient and stable to air and moisture. The optical and electronic properties are compared with those of related linear oligomers with electron&#8208;withdrawing FMes or electron&#8208;donating Mes* (2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) groups, and the electronic structure is further evaluated by computational methods. These studies uncover unique properties of B6&#8208;FMes, including a low&#8208;lying and extensively delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and a wide HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (HOMO = highest occupied molecular orbital), which arise from the combination of (a) a cyclic &#960;&#8208;system, (b) strong electronic communication between the closely spaced borons, and (c) the attachment of electron&#8208;deficient pendent groups.

      <title>Functional Analysis of a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Demonstrates Role of Spontaneous Double Bicyclo&#8208;ring Formation Including 8&#960;&#8211;6&#960; Electrocyclization in Shimalactone Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Shimalactones A and B are neuritogenic polyketides possessing characteristic oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene ring systems, produced by the marine fungus Emericella variecolor GF10. We identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster from a draft genome analysis of the fungus, and conducted a heterologous expression analysis. Expression of ShmA polyketide synthase in Aspergillus oryzae resulted in production of preshimalactone. Aspergillus oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants expressing ShmA and ShmB produced shimalactones A and B, suggesting that the double bicyclo&#8208;ring formation reactions proceed non&#8208;enzymatically from preshimalactone epoxide. Density functional theory calculations strongly support the idea that oxabicyclo&#8208;ring formation and 8&#960;&#8211;6&#960; electrocyclization proceed spontaneously after opening of the preshimalactone epoxide ring via protonation.

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Ene Cationic and Radical Reactions: Cyclization, Step&#8208;Growth, and Concurrent Polymerizations for Thioacetal and Thioether Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Growth potential: Thiol&#8208;ene cationic and radical reactions were achieved not only for 1:1 addition between a thiol and vinyl ether but also for cyclization and step&#8208;growth polymerization between a dithiol and divinyl ether. An organic acid and a radical initiator, respectively, led selectively to the formation of thioacetal and thioether linkages. Concurrent cationic and radical step&#8208;growth polymerization was also realized to afford polymers composed of both thioacetal and thioether linkages in the main chains.







Abstract
Thiol&#8208;ene cationic and radical reactions were conducted for 1:1 addition between a thiol and vinyl ether, and also for cyclization and step&#8208;growth polymerization between a dithiol and divinyl ether. p&#8208;Toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) induced a cationic thiol&#8208;ene reaction to generate a thioacetal in high yield, whereas 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobisisobutyronitrile resulted in a radical thiol&#8208;ene reaction to give a thioether, also in high yield. The cationic and radical addition reactions between a dithiol and divinyl ether with oxyethylene units yielded amorphous poly(thioacetal)s and crystalline poly(thioether)s, respectively. Under high&#8208;dilution conditions, the cationic and radical reactions resulted in 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal and thioether products, respectively. Furthermore, concurrent cationic and radical step&#8208;growth polymerizations were realized using PTSA under UV irradiation to produce polymers having both thioacetal and thioether linkages in the main chain.

      <title>Singlet Fission in Carbene Derived Diradicaloids</title>
      <dc:description>In large, the documentation of singlet fission (SF) is showcased in examples involving polyacenes and polyenes. SF has been hitherto studied in depth, on one hand, in solids and, on the other hand, in solutions, in which cases covalent bridges are required to link two or more chromophores. Going beyond polyacenes and polyenes is driven by exploring new classes of SF&#8208;materials. Herein, we present a new class of SF&#8208;materials based on diradicaloids of carbene scaffolds, namely cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs). Our modular approach allows for tuning two key SF&#8208;criteria: the steric factor and the diradical character. In turn, we modified the energy landscapes of excited states in a systematic manner to accommodate the needs for SF. We report the first example on intermolecular SF in solutions for CAAC dimers formed via self&#8208;assembly at cryogenic temperatures.</dc:description>

      <title>Correlating pressure&#8208;induced emission modulation with linker rotation in a photoluminescent MOF</title>
      <dc:description>Conformational changes of linker units in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often responsible for gate&#8208;opening phenomena in selective gas adsorption and stimuli&#8208;responsive optical and electrical sensing behaviour. Herein, we show that pressure&#8208;induced bathochromic shifts in both fluorescence emission and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra of a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated Hf MOF, linked by 1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethynylbenzoate) ligands (  Hf&#8208;peb  ), are induced by rotation of the central phenyl ring of the linker, from a coplanar arrangement to a twisted, previously unseen conformer. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, alongside  in situ  fluorescence and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopies, measured up to 2.1 GPa in a diamond anvil cell on single crystals, are in excellent agreement, correlating linker rotation with modulation of emission. Topologically isolating the 1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethynylbenzoate) units within a MOF facilitates concurrent structural and spectroscopic study in the absence of intermolecular perturbation, allowing characterisation of the luminescence properties of a high&#8208;energy, twisted conformation of the previously well&#8208;studied chromophore.

      <dc:description>Herein we report a new molecular design principle for creating double gyroid nanostructured molecular assemblies based on atropisomerization. Ionic amphiphiles containing two imidazolium rings in close proximity to one another were designed and synthesized. NMR data revealed that the rotation of the imidazolium rings is restricted, with an activation energy as high as 63 kJ mol  &#8211;1  in DMSO&#8208;  d  6  solution. DFT calculations predicted an activation energy of 90&#8211;100 kJ mol  &#8211;1  in vacuum for a model compound. Due to the restricted rotation, the amphiphiles feature &#8220;double&#8221; atropisomeric axes in their ionic segments and form three stable atropisomers, namely: meso,  R  and  S  .

      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanoassemblies capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have semi&#8208;rationally designed a series of seven&#8208;residue peptides that form hemin&#8208;binding catalytic amyloids to facilitate enantioselective cyclopropanation with efficiencies that rival those of engineered hemin proteins. These results demonstrate that: 1. Catalytic amyloids can bind complex metallocofactors to promote practically important multisubstrate transformations; 2. Even essentially flat surfaces of amyloid assemblies can impart a substantial degree of enantioselectivity without the need for extensive optimization; 3. The ease of peptide preparation allows for straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids and preparation of peptides made of D&#8208;amino acids with complete reversal of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

The heterostructures provide a H2 generation rate of 9039&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 without the use of co&#8208;catalysts, and CrVI is completely reduced in 45&#8197;min.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive hierarchical Co9S8/ZnIn2S4 tubular heterostructures are fabricated by growing 2D ZnIn2S4 nanosheets on 1D hollow Co9S8 nanotubes. This design combines two photoresponsive sulfide semiconductors in a stable heterojunction with a hierarchical hollow tubular structure, improving visible&#8208;light absorption, yielding a large surface area, exposing sufficient catalytically active sites, and promoting the separation and migration of photogenerated charges. The hierarchical nanotubes exhibit excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution and CrVI reduction efficiency. Under visible&#8208;light illumination, the optimized Co9S8/ZnIn2S4 heterostructure provides a remarkable H2 generation rate of 9039&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 without the use of any co&#8208;catalysts and CrVI is completely reduced in 45&#8197;min. The Co9S8/ZnIn2S4 heterostructure is stable after multiple photocatalytic cycles.

      <title>Solvent Molecule Cooperation Enhancing Lithium Metal Battery Performance at Both Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A good mix: In an ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;ethylene sulfite (ES) mixed electrolyte, EC dominates the solvation sheath of Li+ and mitigates side reactions on both electrodes and ES introduces sulfur&#8208;containing species at the solid electrolyte interphase on the Li metal anode. Taken together the components of the electrolyte solvent enable efficient and stable cycling of Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing electrolytes compatible with efficient and reversible cycling of electrodes is critical to the success of rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs). The Coulombic efficiencies and cycle lives of LMBs with ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate, ethylene sulfite (ES), and their combinations as electrolyte solvents show that in a binary&#8208;solvent electrolyte the extent of electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface is dependent on the solvent component that dominates the solvation sheath of Li+. This knowledge led to the development of an EC&#8208;ES electrolyte exhibiting high performance for Li||LiFePO4 batteries. Carbonate molecules occupy the solvation sheath and improve the Coulombic efficiencies of both the anode and cathode. Sulfite molecules lead to desirable morphology and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase and extend the cycle life of the Li metal anode. The cooperation between these components provides a new example of electrolyte optimization for improved LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A good mix&lt;/b&gt;: In an ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;ethylene sulfite (ES) mixed electrolyte, EC dominates the solvation sheath of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and mitigates side reactions on both electrodes and ES introduces sulfur&#8208;containing species at the solid electrolyte interphase on the Li metal anode. Taken together the components of the electrolyte solvent enable efficient and stable cycling of Li metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing electrolytes compatible with efficient and reversible cycling of electrodes is critical to the success of rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs). The Coulombic efficiencies and cycle lives of LMBs with ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate, ethylene sulfite (ES), and their combinations as electrolyte solvents show that in a binary&#8208;solvent electrolyte the extent of electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface is dependent on the solvent component that dominates the solvation sheath of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This knowledge led to the development of an EC&#8208;ES electrolyte exhibiting high performance for Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Carbonate molecules occupy the solvation sheath and improve the Coulombic efficiencies of both the anode and cathode. Sulfite molecules lead to desirable morphology and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase and extend the cycle life of the Li metal anode. The cooperation between these components provides a new example of electrolyte optimization for improved LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In situ Synthesis of Biomimetic Silica Nanofibrous Aerogels with Temperature&#8208;Invariant Superelasticity over One Million Compressions</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic aerogels are fabricated by combining flexible electrospun silica nanofibers and rubber&#8208;like Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si networks via an in situ synthesis strategy. The aerogels exhibit temperature&#8208;invariant superelasticity, fire resistance, and ultralow thermal conductivity, which make them promising thermal insulation materials for extreme environments.







Abstract
Resilient and compressible three&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials comprising polymers, carbon, and metals have been prepared in diverse forms. However, the creation of thermostable elastic ceramic aerogels remains an enormous challenge. We demonstrate an in&#8197;situ synthesis strategy to develop biomimetic silica nanofibrous (SNF) aerogels with superelasticity by integrating flexible electrospun silica nanofibers and rubber&#8208;like Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonding networks. The stable bonding structure among nanofibers is in&#8197;situ constructed along with a fibrous freeze&#8208;shaping process. The resultant SNF aerogels exhibit integrated properties of ultralow density (&gt;0.25&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3), temperature&#8208;invariant superelasticity up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, and robust fatigue resistance over one million compressions. The ceramic nature also endows the aerogels with fire resistance and ultralow thermal conductivity. The successful synthesis of the SNF aerogels opens new pathways for the design of superelastic ceramic aerogels in a structurally adaptive and scalable form.

      <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface modification is presented. It consists of oxygen vacancies, spinel phase integration, and N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayers synchronously built on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 microspheres via the pyrolysis of urea.

Abstract
Voltage decay and capacity fading are the main challenges for the commercialization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs). Now, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment is designed via the pyrolysis of urea to improve the voltage and capacity stability of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 (LMNO), by which oxygen vacancies, spinel phase integration, and N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayers are synchronously built on the surface of LMNO microspheres. Oxygen vacancies and spinel phase integration suppress irreversible O2 release and help lithium ion diffusion, while N&#8208;doped carbon nanolayer mitigates the corrosion of electrolyte with excellent conductivity. The electrochemical performance of LMNO after the treatment improves significantly; the capacity retention rate after 500 cycles at 1&#8201;C is still as high as 89.9&#8201;% with a very small voltage fading rate of 1.09&#8197;mV&#8201;cycle&#8722;1. This three&#8208;in&#8208;one surface treatment strategy can suppress the voltage decay and capacity fading of LLOs.

      <title>Mercaptothiacalixarenes Steer 24 Copper(I) Centers to form a Hollow&#8208;Sphere Structure Featuring Cu2S2 Motifs with Exceptionally Short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu Distances</title>

A cluster with a CuI24S48 nanocage can be accessed in high yields using mercaptothiacalixarenes as directing ligands.

Abstract
Tetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene (LH4) can be used as a coordination platform to bind four CuI ions at the thiolate and thioether S atoms. Donor ligands such as phosphanes can stabilize the resulting [LCu4] units, which then remain monomeric ([(Ph3PCu)4L]). In the absence of donor ligands, they aggregate, providing a hexamer ([LCu4]6) in high yields, with a hollow&#8208;sphere structure formed by an unprecedented Cu24S48 cage that is surrounded by the organic framework of the calixarene chalices. Preliminary NMR experiments with regard to the host&#8208;guest chemistry in solution showed that the compound represents a polytopic host for acetonitrile and methane.

      <title>Formation and Characterization of a BeOBeC Multiple Radical Featuring a Quartet Carbyne Moiety</title>
      <dc:description>
The BeOBeC multiple radical features a quartet carbyne moiety, and thus represents the first carbyne radical to have a quartet ground state with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center.







Abstract
Through reaction of beryllium dimers with carbon monoxide, a carbonyl complex BeBeCO is formed in solid neon. Upon visible light excitation, the BeBeCO complex rearranges to a BeCOBe isomer, which further isomerizes to a low&#8208;energy BeOBeC species under UV&#8208;visible light excitation. These species are identified on the basis of infrared absorption spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical studies. The BeOBeC molecule is characterized to be a multiple radical species having an electronic quintet ground state featuring an unusual quartet carbyne unit with three unpaired electrons on the carbon center. Bonding analysis indicates that the strong Pauli repulsion between carbon 2s lone pair electrons and the &#963; electrons of the BeOBe fragment significantly weakens the Be&#8722;C bonding and destabilizes the triplet state of the BeOBeC radical with a doublet carbyne unit. The three&#8208;center &#960;&#8208;bonding of BeOBe is also found to play a role in stabilizing the quartet carbyne.

      <title>How Nano&#8208;Ions Act Like Ionic Surfactants</title>
      <dc:description>
Free of charge: Inorganic nano&#8208;ions were found to act like (organic) ionic surfactants when added to dilute solutions of non&#8208;ionic surfactants, inducing spontaneous vesicle formation by adsorption and thus electrically charging the non&#8208;ionic lamellar phase. Although they are fundamentally different, nano&#8208;ions can serve as alternatives to ionic surfactants.







Abstract
Recently, nanometric ions were shown to adsorb to hydrated neutral surfaces and to bind to the cavities of macrocyclic molecules with an unexpectedly strong affinity arising from a solvent&#8208;mediated effect named superchaotropicity. We show here that nano&#8208;ions at low concentrations (&#956;m range), similarly to anionic surfactants, induce the spontaneous transformation of a swollen lyotropic lamellar phase of non&#8208;ionic surfactant into a vesicle phase. This transition occurs when the neutral lamellae acquire charges, either by adsorption of the nano&#8208;ions onto, or by anchoring of the ionic surfactant into the lamellae. In contrast to ionic surfactants, nano&#8208;ions strongly dehydrate the neutral surfactant assemblies. As a conclusion, these purely inorganic nanometric ions act as alternatives to the widely used organic ionic surfactants.

      <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Propargyl Amide with Vicinal Stereocenters through Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation</title>
      <dc:description>
One for all: A hydroalkynylation method for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargyl amines with two stereogenic centers was developed. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enamides proceeds to give propargyl amides in a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective fashion. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four possible stereoisomers was achieved using this strategy.







Abstract
Chiral propargyl amines are valuable synthetic intermediates for the preparation of biologically active compounds and functionalized amines. Catalytic methods to access propargyl amines containing vicinal stereocenters with high diastereoselectivity are particularly rare. We report an unprecedented strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargyl amines with two stereogenic centres. An iridium complex, ligated by a phosphoramidite ligand, catalyzes the hydroalkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enamides to afford propargyl amides in a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective fashion. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four possible stereoisomers was achieved using this strategy.

      <title>Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution&#160;of Racemic Tertiary Bromides byPentanidium&#8208;Catalyzed Phase&#8208;Transfer Azidation</title>
      <dc:description>We have developed&#160; a methodology to afford&#160;enantioenriched&#160; tertiary azides and bromides through pentanidium&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic tertiary bromides under base free condition. We found that the absence of water is crucial to obtain high selectivity factor (  s  ). On the other hand,&#160; new experimental observations and DFT modelling led us to propose that enantioconvergent azidation of tertiary bromides proceeded through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). The investigations particularly identified the crucial roles of base and water in the enantioconvergent process, supporting the proposal that&#160; tertiary bromide isomerizes in the presence of base and water through a S  N  2X pathway .</dc:description>

      <title>On&#8208;surface assembly of hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular graphyne&#8208;like networks</title>
      <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface assembly of graphyne&#8208;related two&#8208; dimensional (2D) materials is directive for the long&#8208;awaited reliable synthesis of the carbon allotrope graphyne. Some of the challenges in the graphyne synthesis is the control of the alkyne coupling reaction on metal surfaces and the fabrication of single&#8208;layered materials in solution&#8208;based methods. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular approach to fabricate highly ordered monolayered hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonded graphyne&#8208;like 2D materials from triethynyltriazine derivatives on Au(111) and Ag(111). The 2D networks are stabilized by N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8722;C(  sp  )&#8208;bonds and N&#183;&#183;&#183;Br&#8722;C(  sp  )&#8208;bonds to the triazine core, respectively. The structural properties and the binding energies of the supramolecular graphynes have been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density&#8208;functional theory calculations. It is revealed that the  N&#183;&#183;&#183;Br&#8722;C(  sp  )  &#8208;bonds lead to significantly stronger bonded networks compared to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. A systematic analysis of the binding energies of triethynyltriazine and triethynylbenzene derivatives further demonstrates that the X  3  &#8208;synthon, which is commonly observed for bromobenzene derivatives, is weaker than the X  6  &#8208;synthon for our bromotriethynyl derivatives.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Remote and minimally&#8208;invasive modulation of biological systems with light has transformed modern biology and neuroscience. However, light absorption and scattering significantly prevents penetration to deep brain regions. Here we describe the use of gold&#8208;coated mechanoresponsive nanovesicles, which consist of liposomes made from the artificial phospholipid Rad&#8208;PC&#8208;Rad as a tool for the delivery of bioactive molecules into brain tissue. Near&#8208;infrared picosecond laser pulses activated the gold&#8208;coating on the surface of nanovesicles, creating nanomechanical stress and leading to near&#8208;complete vesicle cargo release in sub&#8208;seconds. Compared to natural phospholipid liposomes, the photo&#8208;release was possible at 40 times lower laser energy. This high photosensitivity enables photorelease of molecules down to a depth of 4 mm in mouse brain. This promising tool provides a versatile platform to optically release functional molecules to modulate brain circuits.</dc:description>

      <title>Activatable Polymeric Reporter For Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Imaging of Invasive Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Discriminative detection of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers is crucial for their effective treatment and prognosis. However, activatable probes able to do so  in vivo  have been rarely developed. We herein report an activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) that specifically turns on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and photoacoustic (PA) signals in response to the urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) overexpressed by invasive breast cancer. P&#8208;Dex has a renal&#8208;clearable dextran backbone which is linked with a NIR dye caged with an uPA&#8208;cleavable peptide substrate. Such a molecular design allows P&#8208;Dex to passive target tumors, activate NIR fluorescence and PA signals to effectively distinguish invasive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer from noninvasive MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to minimize the toxicity potential.

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Assemblies Enable Mitochondria Localization of Histone H2B in Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: It is known that a highly dynamic communication among subcellular organelles (e.g., cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and nucleus) dictate cellular behaviors. But little information exists on how the inter&#8208;organelle crosstalk impacts cancer cells due to the lack of approaches that manipulate inter&#8208;organelle communication in cancer cells. We unexpectedly found that a negatively charged, enzyme cleavable peptide enables the trafficking of histone protein (H2B), a nuclear protein, to the mitochondria in cancer cells. The peptide, denoted as MitoFlag,

interacts with the nuclear location sequence (NLS) of H2B to block it entering nucleus. A protease on the mitochondria cleaves the Flag from the complex of MitoFlag and H2B to form assemblies that retain H2B on the mitochondria and facilitate the H2B entering mitochondria. Molecular validation of MitoFlag shows that adding NLS, replacing aspartic acid residues by glutamic acid residues, or changing L&#8208;aspartic acid to D&#8208;aspartic residue abolishes the trafficking of H2B into mitochondria of HeLa cells.

This unprecedented olefination process involves a carbene migratory insertion into &#8220;CuCF  3  &#8221; to generate the  &#945;  &#8208;CF  3  &#8208;substituted organocopper species, which then undergoes  &#223;  &#8208;fluoride elimination and two consecutive addition&#8208;elimination processes to give the desired products. The key to this efficient one&#8208;pot C  1  &#8208;to&#8208;C  3  synthetic protocol lies in the controllable double CF  3  &#8208;addditions (over single and triple additions).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
