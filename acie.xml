      <title>Metal&#8208;like ductility in organic plastic crystals: Role of molecular shape and dihydrogen bonding interactions in aminoboranes</title>
      <dc:description>Ductility, which is a common phenomenon in many metals, is hard to achieve in molecular crystals. Organic crystals have been recently shown to bend plastically on one or two face specific directions, but they fracture when stressed in any other arbitrary directions. Here, we report an exceptional metal&#8208;like ductility and malleability in crystals of two globular molecules, BH  3  NMe  3  and BF  3  NMe  3  , with characteristic tensile stretching, compression, twisting and thinning (increase of width over 500%). Surprisingly, the mechanically deformed samples, which transition to lower symmetry phases, not only retain good long range order, but also allow structure determination by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Molecules in these high symmetry crystals interact predominantly  via  electrostatic forces (B  &#8211;  &#8211;N  +  ) and form columnar structures, thus forming multiple slip planes with weak dispersive forces among columns. While the former interactions hold molecules together, the latter facilitate exceptional ductility. On the other hand, the limited number of facile slip planes and strong dihydrogen bonding in BH  3  NHMe  2  negates ductility. The understanding gained in the aminoboranes with exceptional ductility and ability to retain crystalline order may enable designing highly modular, easy&#8208;to&#8208;cast crystalline functional organics, for applications in ferroelectrics, barocalorimetry and soft&#8208;robotics.</dc:description>

      <title>Modular synthesis of nonadecasaccharide motif from Psidium guajava polysaccharides with potent antidiabetic activity through orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrates are important biomolecules with numerous crucial roles in a variety of biological processes. Due to the issues of microheterogeneity, isolation of pure and sufficient amounts of glycans from nature is a formidable task. Chemical synthesis is an efficient and scalable method to obtain well&#8208;defined and pure glycans for developing therapeutic agents and deciphering their functions. So far, synthesis of long, branched and complex carbohydrate sequences remains one of the most challenging tasks in chemical synthesis. Here, we report an efficient modular one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonadecasaccharide and shorter sequences from  Psidium guajava  polysaccharide with potent a&#8208;glucosidase inhibitory activity. Our synthetic strategies have the following features: (1) several one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions on the basis of PTFAI glycosylation and Yu glycosylation to streamline the chemical synthesis of oligosaccharides, (2) the successful and efficient assembly sequences (first O&#8208;3&#8217;, second O&#8208;5&#8217;, final O&#8208;2&#8217;) toward the challenging 2, 3, 5&#8208;branched Ara  f  motif, (3) the stereoselective 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glucosylation by reagent control, and (4) the convergent [6 + 6 + 7] one&#8208;pot coupling reaction for the final assembly of the target nonadecasaccharide. Our results demonstrate that one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy using PTFAI glycosylation and Yu glycosylation can streamline the chemical synthesis of long, branched and complicated carbohydrate chains.</dc:description>

      <title>Vacancy Engineering of Fe&#8208;doped W18O49 Nanoreactors for Low&#8208;barrier Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising energy&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;emission alternative to the traditional Haber&#8208;Bosch method. Usually, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and reaction barrier of ambient electrochemical NRR are most significant challenges, making the simultaneous achievement of a high NH  3  yielding rate and a high Faradic efficiency (FE) extremely difficult for NRR. To address this issue, W  18  O  49  , with exposed W sites and intrinsically weak binding for H  2  , is doped by Fe to modify its surface atomic structure for effective NRR electrocatalysis and suppressed HER. On it, a high NH  3  yielding rate of 24.7 &#956;g h  &#8722;1  &#160;mg  &#8208;1  cat.  &#160;and a high FE of 20.0% have been simultaneously gained at a very low overpotential of &#8722;0.15 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.  Ab initio  reveals an intercalation&#8208;type doping of Fe atoms in the tunnels of the W  18  O  49  crystal structure, which increases the oxygen vacancies for exposing more W active sites, optimizes the nitrogen adsorption energy, and facilitates the electrocatalytic NRR. Thus, this work will provide a rational design of electrocatalysts for various electrochemical processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline) Based Functional Mimics of Peptides to Eradicate MRSA Infections and Persisters While Alleviating Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
      <dc:description>Peptides have important biological functions. However, peptides&#8217; susceptibility to proteolysis is a big hurdle to their application. We demonstrated, for the first time, that poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) can work as functional mimics of peptides. Using host defense peptide as a model, we showed poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) based glycine pseudopeptides can mimic host defense peptide and have potent  in vitro  and  in vivo  activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  that cause formidable infections. The poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) showed potent activity against persister cells that are highly resistant to antibiotics.

      <title>Photomechanical Luminescence from Through&#8208;Space Conjugated AIEgens</title>
      <dc:description>
Dancing brightly under light: An intriguing photomechanical luminescence is observed for P&#8208;BTO crystals, driven by a photodimerization reaction under UV light irradiation. The generated photodimer 2P&#8208;BTO exhibits prominent through&#8208;space conjugation and aggregation&#8208;induced emission with an excellent solid&#8208;state fluorescence quantum yield of up to 96.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Transforming molecular motions into the macroscopic scale is a topic of great interest to nanoscience. The photomechanical effect is a promising strategy to achieve this goal. Herein, we report an intriguing photomechanical luminescence driven by the photodimerization of 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide (P&#8208;BTO) in molecular crystals and elucidate the working mechanism and substituent effect through crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations. Striking splitting, hopping, and bending mechanical behaviors accompanied by a significant blue fluorescence enhancement are observed for P&#8208;BTO crystals under UV light, which is attributed to the formation of photodimer 2P&#8208;BTO. Although 2P&#8208;BTO is poorly &#960;&#8208;conjugated because of the central cyclobutane ring, it exhibits prominent through&#8208;space conjugation and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), affording strong solid&#8208;state blue fluorescence at 415&#8197;nm with an excellent quantum yield of up to 96.2&#8201;%.

      <title>Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) Reactions&#8212;A Reappraisal</title>
      <dc:description>
Where radicals come from: Molecule&#8208;induced radical formation (MIRF) processes, where one closed&#8208;shell molecule helps another one dissociate, are viable alternatives for simple unimolecular homolytic bond breaking events.







Abstract
Radical chain reactions are commonly initiated through the thermal or photochemical activation of purpose&#8208;built initiators, through photochemical activation of substrates, or through well&#8208;designed redox processes. Where radicals come from in the absence of these initiation strategies is much less obvious and are often assumed to derive from unknown impurities. In this situation, molecule&#8208;induced radical formation (MIRF) reactions should be considered as well&#8208;defined alternative initiation modes. In the most general definition of MIRF reactions, two closed&#8208;shell molecules react to give a radical pair or biradical. The exact nature of this transformation depends on the &#963;&#8208; or &#960;&#8208;bonds involved in the MIRF process, and this Minireview specifically focuses on reactions that transform two &#963;&#8208;bonds into two radicals and a closed&#8208;shell product molecule.

      <title>Closing the loop for hydrogen storage: Facile regeneration of NaBH4 from its hydrolytic product</title>
      <dc:description>Sodium borohydride (NaBH4  ) is among the most studied hydrogen storage materials since it is able to deliver high purity H2  at room temperature with controllable kinetics via hydrolysis, but its regeneration from the hydrolytic product has been challenging. Herein we report a facile method to regenerate NaBH4  with high yield and low costs. The hydrolytic product NaBO2  in aqueous solution reacts with CO2  forming Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O and Na2CO3  , both of which are ball milled with Mg under ambient conditions to form NaBH4  with a high yield close to 80%. Compared with previous studies, this new approach avoids expensive reducing agent such as MgH2  , bypasses the energy&#8208;intensive dehydration procedure to remove water from Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O, and does not require&#160;high&#8208;pressure H2  gas, therefore leading to much reduced costs. This method is expected to effectively close the loop of NaBH4  regeneration and hydrolysis, enabling a wide deployment of NaBH4  for hydrogen storage.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Direct construction of supramolecular coordination complexes with both luminescent and mesogenic properties is a contemporary challenge. Herein we report two rhomboidal metallacycles based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Because metal&#8208;coordination interactions restrict the rotation of phenyl groups on tetraphenylethene units, these metallacycles were emissive both in solution and in solid state, and their aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties were well retained. Moreover, the rhomboidal metallacyclic structures offer a platform for intermolecular packing benefical for the formation of liquid crystalline phases. Therefore, although neither of building blocks shows mesogenic properties, both thermotropic and lyotropic (in DMF) mesophases were observed in one of metallacycles indicating that mesophases could be induced by metal&#8208;coordination interactions. This study not only reveals the mechanism for the formation of cavity&#8208;cored liquid crystals, but also provides a convenient approach to preparing supramolecular luminescent liquid crystals, which will serve as good candidates for chemo sensors and liquid crystal displays.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When the components of a metal organic framework, MOF, and a crystal growth modulator diffuse through a gel medium, they can form arrays of regularly&#8208;spaced precipitation bands containing MOF crystals of different morphologies.&#160; With time, slow variations in the local concentrations of the growth modulator cause the crystals to change their shapes, ultimately resulting in unusual concave microcrystallites not available via solution&#8208;based methods.&#160; The reaction&#8208;diffusion and periodic precipitation phenomena (i) extend to various types of MOFs and also MOPs (metal organic polyhedra), and (ii) can be multiplexed to realize within one gel multiple growth conditions, in effect leading to various crystalline phases or polycrystalline formations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Perylene Bisimide and Naphthyl&#8208;based Molecular Dyads: Hydrogen Bond Driving Co&#8208;planarization with Anomalous Temperature Response Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>We have elucidated the origin of the positive temperature effect in fluorescence emission of a newly designed perylene bisimide (  PBI  ) derivative with two naphthyl units containing  ortho  &#8208;methoxy group (  NM  ) at its bay positions (  PBI&#8208;2N  M  ). A key point in the elucidation is the finding of a weak hydrogen bond (&lt; 5.0 kcal&#183;mol  &#8208;1  ) between the methoxy group of the  NM  unit and a nearby hydrogen atom of the  PBI  core. It is the bonding that drives co&#8208;planarization of the different aromatic units, resulting in delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the compound as synthesized, inducing fluorescence quenching via intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). With raising temperature, the co&#8208;planar structure could be distorted, in part, resulting in decreased degree of ICT, and hence leading to enhanced fluorescence emission. The unique positive temperature effect in emission induced by H&#8208;bond driven co&#8208;planarization may pave a new avenue in designing functional molecular systems complementary to conventional methodologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Deciphering iron&#8208;dependent activity in oxygen evolution catalyzed by nickel iron layered double hydroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Nickel iron oxyhydroxide is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Whereas the presence of Fe ions is essential to the high activity, the functions of Fe are currently under debate. Using oxygen isotope labelling and operando Raman spectroscopic experiments, we obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites for a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are structurally defined samples of the corresponding oxyhydroxides. The Fe sites have TOFs 20&#8208;200 times higher than the Ni sites such that at an Fe content of 4.7% and above the Fe sites dominate the catalysis. Higher Fe contents lead to larger structural disorder of the NiOOH host. A Volcano&#8208;type correlation was found between the TOFs of Fe sites and the structural disorder of NiOOH. Our work elucidates the origin of the Fe&#8208;dependent activity of NiFe LDH, and suggests structural ordering as a strategy to improve OER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Sorbents for the Direct Capture of CO2 from Ambient Air</title>
      <dc:description>
Clearing the air: Pulling CO2 out of ambient air requires sorbents with unusual properties. Recent progress in surface chemistry and material synthesis have resulted in a new generation of solid CO2 sorbents tuned to the exacting demands of direct air capture and negative emissions on a global scale.







Abstract
The urgency to address global climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions is increasing. In particular, the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels is generating alarm. Technologies to remove CO2 from ambient air, or &#8220;direct air capture&#8221; (DAC), have recently demonstrated that they can contribute to &#8220;negative carbon emission.&#8221; Recent advances in surface chemistry and material synthesis have resulted in new generations of CO2 sorbents, which may drive the future of DAC and its large&#8208;scale deployment. This Review describes major types of sorbents designed to capture CO2 from ambient air and they are categorized by the sorption mechanism: physisorption, chemisorption, and moisture&#8208;swing sorption.

      <dc:description>Immobilization of compartmentalized microscale objects in three&#8208;dimensional hydrogels provides a step towards the modular assembly of soft functional materials with tunable architectures and distributed functionalities. Here we use a combination of micro&#8208;compartmentalization, immobilization and modularization to fabricate and assemble hydrogel&#8208;based micro&#8208;reactor assemblies comprising millions of functionalized polysaccharide&#8208;polynucleotide coacervate droplets. The heterogeneous hydrogels can be structurally fused by interfacial crosslinking and coupled as input and output modules to implement a UV&#8208;induced photocatalytic/ peroxidation nanoparticle/ DNAzyme reaction cascade that generates a spatiotemporal fluorescence read&#8208;out depending on the droplet number density, intensity of photo&#8208;energization and chemical flux. Our approach offers a route to heterogeneous hydrogels with endogenous reactivity and reconfigurable architecture, and provides a step towards the development of soft modular materials with programmable functionality.</dc:description>

The heterogeneous hydrogels can be structurally fused by interfacial crosslinking and coupled as input and output modules to implement a UV&#8208;induced photocatalytic/ peroxidation nanoparticle/ DNAzyme reaction cascade that generates a spatiotemporal fluorescence read&#8208;out depending on the droplet number density, intensity of photo&#8208;energization and chemical flux. Our approach offers a route to heterogeneous hydrogels with endogenous reactivity and reconfigurable architecture, and provides a step towards the development of soft modular materials with programmable functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Primary Anion&#8211;&#960; Catalysis of Epoxide&#8208;Opening Ether Cyclization into Rings of Different Sizes: Access to New Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>
New interactions in catalysis are expected to provide access to new products from known reactions. For anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis, new mechanisms for epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclization have been discovered, but result in the same products as those from conventional Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Now, disfavored large ring oxepanes and oxocanes (yellow) are accessible on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces.







Abstract
The concept of anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis focuses on the stabilization of anionic transition states on aromatic &#960; surfaces. Recently, we demonstrated the occurrence of epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclizations on aromatic &#960; surfaces. Although the reaction proceeded through unconventional mechanisms, the obtained products are the same as those from conventional Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, and in agreement with the Baldwin selectivity rules. Different mechanisms, however, should ultimately lead to new products, a promise anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis has been reluctant to live up to. Herein, we report non&#8208;trivial reactions that work with anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis, but not with Br&#248;nsted acids, under comparable conditions. Namely, we show that the anion&#8211;&#960; templated autocatalysis and epoxide opening with alcoholate&#8211;&#960; interactions can provide access to unconventional ring chemistry. For smaller rings, anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis affords anti&#8208;Baldwin oxolanes, 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanes, and the expansion of Baldwin oxetanes by methyl migration. For larger rings, anion&#8211;&#960; templated autocatalysis is thought to alleviate the entropic penalty of folding to enable disfavored anti&#8208;Baldwin cyclizations into oxepanes and oxocanes.

      <title>Towards Reliable and Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS): From Key Parameters to Good Analytical Practice</title>
      <dc:description>
Parameters and pitfalls: Key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are highlighted. Good analytical practice is proposed to increase the inter&#8208;laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.







Abstract
Experimental results obtained in different laboratories world&#8208;wide by researchers using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can differ significantly. We, an international team of scientists with long&#8208;standing expertise in SERS, address this issue from our perspective by presenting considerations on reliable and quantitative SERS. The central idea of this joint effort is to highlight key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in the literature. To that end, we provide here a series of recommendations on: a)&#8197;the characterization of solid and colloidal SERS substrates by correlative electron and optical microscopy and spectroscopy, b)&#8197;on the determination of the SERS enhancement factor (EF), including suitable Raman reporter/probe molecules, and finally on c)&#8197;good analytical practice. We hope that both newcomers and specialists will benefit from these recommendations to increase the inter&#8208;laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.

      <dc:description>In hunting for safe and cost&#8208;effective materials for post lithium&#8208;ion energy storage systems, design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance solid electrolytes (SEs) are currently bottlenecks for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

It is noted that presence of water and &#9642;OH results in an increase in ionic conductivity of NaBi  3  O  4  Cl  2  due to the diffusion of H  2  O into NaBi  3  O  4  Cl  2  and partially forming binding &#9642;OH through oxygen vacancy repairing. Furthermore, Ab intio calculation reveals that the electrons significantly accumulate around &#9642;OH and induce a more negative charge center which can promote Na  +  hopping.

      <title>Magnetothermal Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted Hierarchical Microfibers for Ultra&#8208;High Energy Density Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical architectures with ordered porous backbone and high charge transfer are significant for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs).

      <title>A New Dimension for Coordination Polymers and Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Towards Functional Glasses and Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>
Heart of glass: The liquid/glass states of coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constitute a new class of amorphous materials and are related to ionic liquids and other ionic soft materials. The unique energy landscape and dynamics of liquid/glass CPs/MOFs with coordination networks offer additional opportunities for properties and functions that are complementary to those of the crystalline state.







Abstract
There are two categories of coordination polymers (CPs): inorganic CPs (i&#8208;CPs) and organic ligand bridged CPs (o&#8208;CPs). Based on the successful crystal engineering of CPs, we here propose noncrystalline states and functionalities as a new research direction for CPs. Control over the liquid or glassy states in materials is essential to obtain specific properties and functions. Several studies suggest the feasibility of obtaining liquid/glassy states in o&#8208;CPs by design principles. The combination of metal ions and organic bridging ligands, together with the liquid/glass phase transformation, offer the possibility to transform o&#8208;CPs into ionic liquids and other ionic soft materials. Synchrotron measurements and computational approaches contribute to elucidating the structures and dynamics of the liquid/glassy states of o&#8208;CPs. This offers the opportunity to tune the porosity, conductivity, transparency, and other material properties. The unique energy landscape of liquid/glass o&#8208;CPs offers opportunities for properties and functions that are complementary to those of the crystalline state.

      <title>Pathway from N&#8208;alkylglycine to alkylisonitrile catalyzed by iron(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;alkylisonitrile, a precursor to isonitrile&#8208;containing lipopeptides, is biosynthesized via decarboxylation&#8208;assisted &#8208;N&#8801;C group (isonitrile) formation by using N&#8208;alkylglycine as the substrate.

Distinct from typical oxygenation or halogenation reactions catalyzed by this class of enzymes, installation of the isonitrile group represents a novel reaction type for Fe/2OG enzymes that involves a four&#8208;electron oxidative process. Here we report the plausible mechanism of three Fe/2OG enzymes, Sav607, ScoE and SfaA, catalyzed isonitrile formation. The X&#8208;ray structures of iron loaded ScoE in complex with its substrate and the intermediate, along with biochemical and biophysical data reveal that &#8208;N&#8801;C bond formation involves two cycles of Fe/2OG enzyme catalysis. The reaction starts with an Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo catalyzed hydroxylation. It is likely followed by decarboxylation&#8208;assisted desaturation to complete isonitrile installation.</dc:description>

Compared with well&#8208;established methods towards five&#8208;membered ring fused&#8208;indolines, the six&#8208;membered ring fused&#8208;indolines are rarely accessed under thermal conditions. Herein, a dearomative [4+2] annulation between different indoles is developed via electrochemical pathway. This transformation offers a remarkable regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner to highly functionalized pyrimido[5,4&#8208;b]indoles under oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, this electrochemical approach maintains excellent functional group tolerance and can be extended as a modification tactic for pharmaceutical researches. Preliminary mechanism studies indicate that the electrooxidation annulation proceeds through radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling between in situ generated indole radical cation and N&#8208;centered radical.</dc:description>

      <title>Origins of Boosted Charge Storage on Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials have rapidly emerged as promising candidates for supercapacitor applications, owing to their tunable surface functionalities and exceptional performances. Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to understanding the origin of boosted charge storage on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbons, none of the present studies has shown a whole landscape. Herein, by both experimental evidence and theoretical simulation, we demonstrate that the heteroatom doping does not only result in a broadened operating voltage, but also successfully promotes the specific capacitance in aqueous supercapacitors. To be more specific, the electrolyte cations adsorbed on heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon can effectively inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction, a key step of water decomposition during the charging process, which broadens the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes even beyond the thermodynamic limit of water (1.23 V). In addition, the reduced adsorption energy of heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon consequently leads to more stored cations on the heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon surface, thus yielding a boosted charge storage performance.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Selectively capturing toxic oxoanions of selenium (Se) and arsenic (As) is highly desired for the remediation of hazardous waste. Ionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (iMOFs) especially cationic MOFs (iMOF&#8208;C) as ion&#8208;exchange materials, featuring aqueous phase stability, present a robust pathway for sequesteration of aforementioned anions due to no leaching associated with its inherent ionic nature. Owing to the scarcity of water stable cationic MOFs, capture of oxoanions of selenium and arsenic has been a major challenge and has not been investigated using iMOFs. Herein, we demonstrate large scale synthesis of cationic MOF towards selective capture of oxoanions of Se(VI) (SeO  4  2  &#8208;  ) and As(V) (HAsO  4  2  &#8208;  ) in water with a maximum sorption capacity of 100 and 85 mg/g respectively.

      <title>On the Binding of Congo Red to Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperative labelling of amyloids: Congo red binds to amyloid fibrils with the long axis oblique to the fibril axis and the plane radial to the fibril core, following a cooperative mechanism characterized by the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex.







Abstract
Amyloids are characterized by their capacity to bind Congo red (CR), one of the most used amyloid&#8208;specific dyes. The structural features of CR binding were unknown for years, mainly because of the lack of amyloid structures solved at high resolution. In the last few years, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy enabled the determination of the structural features of amyloids, such as the HET&#8208;s prion forming domain (HET&#8208;s PFD), which also has recently been used to determine the amyloid&#8211;CR interface at atomic resolution. Herein, we combine spectroscopic data with molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and excitonic quantum/molecular mechanics calculations to examine and rationalize CR binding to amyloids. In contrast to a previous assumption on the binding mode, our results suggest that CR binding to the HET&#8208;s PFD involves a cooperative process entailing the formation of a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. This provides a molecular basis to explain the bathochromic shift in the maximal absorbance wavelength when CR is bound to amyloids.

In the last few years, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy enabled the determination of the structural features of amyloids, such as the HET&#8208;s prion forming domain (HET&#8208;s PFD), which also has recently been used to determine the amyloid&#8211;CR interface at atomic resolution. Herein, we combine spectroscopic data with molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and excitonic quantum/molecular mechanics calculations to examine and rationalize CR binding to amyloids. In contrast to a previous assumption on the binding mode, our results suggest that CR binding to the HET&#8208;s PFD involves a cooperative process entailing the formation of a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. This provides a molecular basis to explain the bathochromic shift in the maximal absorbance wavelength when CR is bound to amyloids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Cyclobutanones: A Speedway to Molecular Complexity</title>
      <dc:description>
Take the strain: The ring strain of cyclobutanones makes them ideal for enantioselective desymmetrization. &#945;&#8208;Functionalization, rearrangement, and C&#8722;C bond activation can be used to directly convert cyclobutanones into enantiomerically enriched compounds, including many biologically significant scaffolds. This Minireview provides an overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods that generate complexity from prochiral cyclobutanones in a single operation.







Abstract
Cyclobutanones hold a privileged role in enantioselective desymmetrization because their inherent ring strain allows for a variety of unusual reactions to occur. Current strategies include &#945;&#8208;functionalization, rearrangement, and C&#8722;C bond activation to directly convert cyclobutanones into a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds, including many biologically significant scaffolds. This Minireview provides an overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods that generate complexity from prochiral cyclobutanones in a single operation.

      <title>A Glycosylated Cationic Block Poly(&#946;&#8208;peptide) Reverses Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance in All ESKAPE Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
The glycosylated cationic &#946;&#8208;peptide PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12 sensitizes the drug&#8208;resistant ESKAPE Gram&#8208;negative bacteria to multiple antibiotics by facilitating penetration through the outer membrane, and by deactivating efflux pump systems, opening an avenue for novel combination therapies for life&#8208;threatening bacterial infections.







Abstract
Carbapenem&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacteria (GNB) are heading the list of pathogens for which antibiotics are the most critically needed. Many antibiotics are either unable to penetrate the outer&#8208;membrane or are excluded by efflux mechanisms. Here, we report a cationic block &#946;&#8208;peptide (PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12) that reverses intrinsic antibiotic resistance in GNB by two distinct mechanisms of action. PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12 does not only compromise the integrity of the bacterial outer&#8208;membrane, it also deactivates efflux pump systems by dissipating the transmembrane electrochemical potential. As a result, PAS8&#8208;b&#8208;PDM12 sensitizes carbapenem&#8208; and colistin&#8208;resistant GNB to multiple antibiotics in vitro and in vivo. The &#946;&#8208;peptide allows the perfect alternation of cationic versus hydrophobic side chains, representing a significant improvement over previous antimicrobial &#945;&#8208;peptides sensitizing agents. Together, our results indicate that it is technically possible for a single adjuvant to reverse innate antibiotic resistance in all pathogenic GNB of the ESKAPE group, including those resistant to last resort antibiotics.

      <title>Nanostructure Engineering by Simple Tuning of Lipid Combinations</title>
      <dc:description>
The simple combination of DMPC and DHPC resulted in various lipid nanostructures with distinct structure&#8211;function relationships, differing in uptake, drug encapsulation efficacy, and in&#8197;vivo anti&#8208;tumor therapy.







Abstract
Structural morphology is the key parameter for efficacy of nanomedicine. To date, lipid&#8208;based nanomaterial has been the most widely used material in nanomedicine and many other biomedical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been an in&#8208;depth or systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;function relationship of lipid&#8208;based nanostructures. In this report, we investigated the formulation of novel lipid&#8208;based nanostructures via simple tuning of lipid combinations. To prove this concept, we used a combination of various ratios of simple and common phospholipids with different chain lengths (14&#8208;carbon chain DMPC: 6&#8208;carbon chain DHPC) to find out whether a myriad of novel lipid nanostructures could be obtained. Interestingly, many combinations resulted in distinct lipid nanostructures. Drug encapsulation tests confirmed that they are able to load large amounts of drugs for biological application. In vivo anti&#8208;tumor efficacy revealed that certain lipid nanostructures possessed superior tumor retardation effects.

      <title>Switchable Polymerization Triggered by Fast and Quantitative Insertion of Carbon Monoxide into Cobalt&#8211;Oxygen Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide is used as a molecular trigger to switch the polymerization mechanism of a cobalt Salen complex from ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides to organometallic mediated controlled radical polymerization (OMRP) of acrylates. Regulated by both CO and visible light, on&#8208;demand sequence control can be achieved for the synthesis of polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polyacrylate diblock copolymers.







Abstract
A strategy that uses carbon monoxide (CO) as a molecular trigger to switch the polymerization mechanism of a cobalt Salen complex [salen=(R,R)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine] from ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides to organometallic mediated controlled radical polymerization (OMRP) of acrylates is described. The key phenomenon is a rapid and quantitative insertion of CO into the Co&#8722;O bond, allowing for in situ transformation of the ROCOP active species (Salen)CoIII&#8208;OR into the OMRP photoinitiator (Salen)CoIII&#8208;CO2R. The proposed mechanism, which involves CO coordination to (Salen)CoIII&#8208;OR and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement via migratory insertion has been rationalized by DFT calculations. Regulated by both CO and visible light, on&#8208;demand sequence control can be achieved for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polyacrylate diblock copolymers (&#272;&lt;1.15).

      <title>Activating Pronucleophiles with High pKa Values: Chiral Organo&#8208;Superbases</title>
      <dc:description>
Superbase: This minireview focuses on chiral organo&#8208;superbases as catalysts in asymmetric reactions of pronucleophiles with high pKa values. The performance of the organo&#8208;superbases, compared to conventional tertiary amine bases, is highlighted. The advantage of these new superbases lies in the opportunity to develop more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.







Abstract
Direct deprotonation represents an extremely simple, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economic strategy to activate pronucleophiles bearing an acidic proton. However, the difficulty often arises in activating pronucleophiles with high pKa values by using conventional chiral tertiary amines. To overcome this challenge, a handful of novel chiral Br&#248;nsted superbases, including amidines, guanidines, cyclopropenimines, and iminophosphoranes, have been discovered in recent years. This minireview focuses on the application of these organo&#8208;superbases in the catalytic asymmetric reactions of weakly acidic pronucleophiles, and highlights their comparison to the conventional tertiary amines, demonstrating the highly efficient deprotonation processes and stereoselectivity controlled conversions of the superbases. The advantage of these new superbases brings a great opportunity for developing more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.

      <title>Insights into charge transfer at the atomically precise nanocluster/semiconductor interface for in&#8208;depth understanding the role of nanocluster in photocatalytic system</title>
      <dc:description>A cluster/semiconductor model is built for exploring the role of noble metal clusters in a photocatalytic system. The incorporation of an atomically precise nanocluster, e.g. Ag44(SR)30, onto a large band gap semiconductor such as TiO2 allows to obtain a clear interface and survey the charge transfer at the interface. The composite is employed for photocatalytic H2 generation. It&#8217;s found that changing the light source from visible light to simulated sunlight leads to an enhancement by three orders of magnitude. The H2 production rate reaches 7.4 mmol/h/gcatalyst, which is five times higher than that of Ag nanoparticles modified TiO2 and even comparable to that of the similar conditioned Pt nanoparticles modified TiO2. Energy band alignment and transient absorption spectroscopy, together with other studies, reveal that the role of the metal clusters is different from both organometallic complexes and plasmonic&#8208;nanoparticles. A type&#8208;II heterojunction charge transfer route is achieved under UV&#8208;vis irradiation, in which the cluster serves as small band gap semiconductor. The type&#8208;II photosystem has a more efficient charge separation ability, which contributes significantly to the enhanced catalytic performance. This finding endows the clusters a broad platform as cocatalysts rather than merely photosensitizers in the applications of light energy conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement controlled by optical manipulation</title>
      <dc:description>We present spatiotemporal control of aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of a protonated tetraphenylethene derivative by optical manipulation. A single sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized aggregate is initially confined by laser irradiation when its fluorescence is hardly detectable. The continuous irradiation into the formed aggregate leads to sudden and rapid growth, resulting in bright yellow fluorescence emission. The fluorescence intensity at peak wavelength at 540 nm is tremendously enhanced with the growth, meaning that AIEE is activated by optical manipulation. Amazingly, the switching on/off of the activation of AIEE is controlled arbitrarily by alternating laser power. This means that optical manipulation increases local concentration, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated molecules, namely, optical manipulation changes the aggregate structure. The dynamics and mechanism in AIEE controlled by optical manipulation will be discussed from the viewpoint of molecular conformation and association depending on laser power.</dc:description>

      <title>BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>A series of BN&#8208;embedded oligomers with different pairs of BN units have been successfully synthesized through electrophilic borylation processes. Organolithium intermediate is avoided in this approach and thus multiple pairs of BN units up to four have been facilely incorporated in the large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Their geometric, photophysical, electrochemical, and Lewis acidic properties have been systematically investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, optical spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry measurements. It is found that the B&#8208;N bonds show delocalized double&#8208;bond characteristics and the conjugation can be extended through the trans&#8208;orientated aromatic azaborine units. Further theoretical calculations reveal the relatively lower aromaticities for the inner azaborine rings in the BN&#8208;embedded PAH oligomers. Moreover, the frontier orbitals of the longer oligomers are delocalized over the inner aromatic rings with negligible weights on the two terminal sides. Consequently, the inner moieties of the BN&#8208;embedded PAH oligomers are more active than the outer parts. This assumption is further confirmed by a simple oxidation reaction and the product is verified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Most interestingly, the oxidation has significant effects on the aromaticities and the intramolecular charge transfer interactions in these BN&#8208;embedded PAHs.

      <dc:description>Layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interests owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320 &#8208; 350 mA h g  &#8722;1  ). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications.

Herein, we reviewed recent research progresses and in&#8208;depth understandings of structure characterizations and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarized the proposed reaction mechanisms on both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species.

      <title>Molten Salt Mediated Synthesis of Atomic Ni Co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2 for Improved Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Atomic co&#8208;catalysts offer high potential to improve the photocatalytic water splitting performance, while the preparation of atomic co&#8208;catalysts with earth&#8208;abundant elements remains challenging. In this work, a new molten salt method (MSM) is designed to prepare atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst on widely studied TiO  2  nanoparticles. The liquid environment and space confinement effect of the molten salt lead to atomic dispersion of Ni ions on TiO  2  , while the strong polarizing force provided by the molten salt promotes the formation of strong Ni&#8208;O bonds. Interestingly, it is found that Ni atoms facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies on the neighbouring surface of TiO  2  during the MSM process, which benefits the charge transfer and hydrogen evolution reaction. Because of the synergy of atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst and oxygen vacancies, the resultant photocatalyst exhibits a four&#8208;time improvement in H  2  evolution rate compared to that of Ni co&#8208;catalyst on TiO  2  photocatalyst prepared by a traditional impregnation method.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report that Ni(COD)(DQ) (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, DQ = duroquinone), an air&#8208;stable 18&#8208;electron complex originally described by Schrauzer in 1962, is a competent precatalyst for a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthetic methods from the literature. Due to its apparent stability, use of Ni(COD)(DQ) as a precatalyst allows reactions to be conveniently performed without use of an inert&#8208;atmosphere glovebox, as demonstrated across several case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;based homolytic substitution (SH) plays an important role in synthetic chemistry, yet whether such a chemistry could occur on the positively charged sulfonium compounds remains unknown. In the study of the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN, a radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme involved in Heme biosynthesis, we observed the production of di&#8208;(5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl)methylsulfonium, supporting&#160; a deoxyadenosyl (dAdo) radical&#8208;mediated SH reaction on the sulfonium center of SAM. The sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions were then investigated in detail by density functional theory calculations and by model reactions, showing that such a type of reactions is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically competent. These findings represent the first report of sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions, which could be useful in synthetic chemistry.

      <title>Solar&#8722;Powered Organic Semiconductor&#8722;Bacteria Biohybrids for CO2 Reduction into Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Photosynthetic biohybrid systems have emerged as a promising platform for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion by integrating excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability of semiconductors with the synthetic capability of biological cells. How to enhance the utilization of solar energy, hole/electron separation efficiency and the electron transfer between the semiconductor and biological cells is crucial to develop high&#8208;performance photosynthesis platforms. In this work, we developed an organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system, which could efficiently realize CO  2  reduction to produce acetic acid through non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria  Moorella thermoacetica  . As the photosensitizers, both cationic electron&#8208;transporting (  n  &#8208;type) perylene diimide derivative (PDI) and hole&#8208;transporting (  p  &#8208;type) poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) were coated on the bacteria surface to form  p  &#8208;  n  heterojunction (PFP/PDI) layer, affording higher hole/electron separation efficiency. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability and biocompatibility, and more importantly, the cationic side chains of organic semiconductors could intercalate into cell membrane, ensuring the efficient electron transfer to bacteria. As a result,  Moorella thermoacetica  can harvest photoexcited electrons from the PFP/PDI heterojunction, which can drive the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway to synthesize acetic acid from CO  2  under illumination. The efficiency of this organic biohybrid is &#8764; 1.6%, which is comparable to those of reported inorganic biohybrid systems. This work opens a new avenue to explore bioenergy application of organic semiconductors, and also provides a convenient biomanufacturing approach to design organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrids for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.</dc:description>

As a result,  Moorella thermoacetica  can harvest photoexcited electrons from the PFP/PDI heterojunction, which can drive the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway to synthesize acetic acid from CO  2  under illumination. The efficiency of this organic biohybrid is &#8764; 1.6%, which is comparable to those of reported inorganic biohybrid systems. This work opens a new avenue to explore bioenergy application of organic semiconductors, and also provides a convenient biomanufacturing approach to design organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrids for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g&#8208;C3N4): An Interface Enabler for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Compatible interfaces: A garnet&#8208;compatible Li&#8208;C3N4 composite anode, with a Li3N&#8208;rich surface, was synthesized from Li and g&#8208;C3N4. The composite electrodes enable a low interfacial resistance and a high critical current density for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLMBs) have attracted considerable interests due to their promising energy density as well as high safety. However, the realization of a well&#8208;matched Li metal/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface remains challenging. Herein, we report g&#8208;C3N4 as a new interface enabler. We discover that introducing g&#8208;C3N4 into Li metal can not only convert the Li metal/garnet&#8208;type SSE interface from point contact to intimate contact but also greatly enhance the capability to suppress the dendritic Li formation because of the greatly enhanced viscosity, decreased surface tension of molten Li, and the in&#8197;situ formation of Li3N at the interface. Thus, the resulting Li&#8208;C3N4|SSE|Li&#8208;C3N4 symmetric cell gives a significantly low interfacial resistance of 11&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2 and a high critical current density (CCD) of 1500&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In contrast, the same symmetric cell configuration with pristine Li metal electrodes has a much larger interfacial resistance (428&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2) and a much lower CCD (50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

      <title>Unravelling the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Substitution in BiO2&#8722;x for Efficient Molecular&#8208;Oxygen Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual defects: Introducing dual defects (surface oxygen vacancies and bulk oxygen substitution) in cubic BiO2&#8722;x was found to lead to a spatial and electronic synergistic process in photocatalytic molecular O2 activation. Oxygen substitution can induce a local electric field to promote bulk separation of electrons and holes, and oxygen vacancies serve as capture centers for electrons to facilitate the adsorption and activation of O2 (see picture).







Abstract
Defects in nanomaterials often lead to properties that are absent in their pristine counterparts. To date, most studies have focused on the effect of single defects, while ignoring the synergy of multiple defects. In this study, a model of photocatalytic O2 activation was selected to unravel the role of dual defects by decorating bismuth oxide with surface O vacancies and bulk O substitution simultaneously. The introduction of dual defects led to a spatial and electronic synergistic process: i)&#8197;O substitution induced a local electric field in the bulk of BiO2&#8722;x, which promoted bulk separation of electrons and holes immediately after their generation; ii)&#8197;O vacancies efficiently lowered the conduction band, served as the capture center for electrons, and thus facilitated the adsorption and activation of O2. This effect was greatly promoted by the coexistence of bulk O substitution, and DFT calculations showed that only O substitution near an O vacancy could have this effect.

      <title>The Importance of 1,5&#8208;Oxygen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Chalcogen Interactions in Enantioselective Isochalcogenourea Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformational and computational analyses of N&#8208;acyl isochalcogenouronium species and comparison with kinetic data demonstrate the significance of 1,5&#8208;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions in enantioselective catalysis. The selenium analogue demonstrates enhanced rate and selectivity profiles across a range of reaction processes compared to its oxygen and sulfur congeners.







Abstract
The importance of 1,5&#8208;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;chalcogen (Ch) interactions in isochalcogenourea catalysis (Ch=O, S, Se) is investigated. Conformational analyses of N&#8208;acyl isochalcogenouronium species and comparison with kinetic data demonstrate the significance of 1,5&#8208;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions in enantioselective catalysis. Importantly, the selenium analogue demonstrates enhanced rate and selectivity profiles across a range of reaction processes including nitronate conjugate addition and formal [4+2] cycloadditions. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the most active selenium analogue was developed using a previously unreported seleno&#8208;Hugerschoff reaction, allowing the challenging kinetic resolutions of tertiary alcohols to be performed at 500&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory (DFT) and natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations support the role of orbital delocalization (occurring by intramolecular chalcogen bonding) in determining the conformation, equilibrium population, and reactivity of N&#8208;acylated intermediates.

      <title>Formulation of Blended&#8208;Lithium&#8208;Salt Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The right mix: Blended&#8208;salt electrolytes have aroused great interest in the burgeoning field of next&#8208;generation lithium batteries. This Review discusses the evolution of blended&#8208;salt electrolytes with the aims of summarizing the key scientific issues related to their formulation and providing meaningful perspectives for their future development toward practical applications.







Abstract
Blended&#8208;salt electrolytes showing synergistic effects have been formulated by simply mixing several lithium salts in an electrolyte. In the burgeoning field of next&#8208;generation lithium batteries, blended&#8208;salt electrolytes have enabled great progress to be made. In this Review, the development of such blended&#8208;salt electrolytes is examined in detail. The reasons for formulating blended&#8208;salt electrolytes for lithium batteries include improvement of thermal stability (safety), inhibition of aluminum&#8208;foil corrosion of the cathode current collector, enhancement of performance over a wide temperature range (or at a high or low temperature), formation of favorable interfacial layers on both electrodes, protection of the lithium metal anode, and attainment of high ionic conductivity. Herein, we highlight key scientific issues related to the formulation of blended&#8208;salt electrolytes for lithium batteries.

      <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Strategies To Interfere with Protein Misfolding, Aggregation, and Cell Degeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
Aberrant protein aggregation in amyloid fibrils is linked to many devastating and thus far incurable cell&#8208;degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, only one of the numerous anti&#8208;amyloid candidates has reached the clinic. This Minireview discusses peptide&#8208;based molecular strategies and peptide chemistry &#8220;tools&#8221; for the design, development, and discovery of peptides as leads for anti&#8208;amyloid drugs.







Abstract
Protein misfolding into amyloid fibrils is linked to more than 40 as yet incurable cell&#8208; and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type&#8197;2 diabetes. So far, however, only one of the numerous anti&#8208;amyloid molecules has reached patients. This Minireview gives an overview of molecular strategies and peptide chemistry &#8220;tools&#8221; to design, develop, and discover peptide&#8208;based molecules as anti&#8208;amyloid drug candidates. We focus on two major inhibitor rational design strategies: 1)&#8197;the oldest and most common strategy, based on molecular recognition elements of amyloid self&#8208;assembly, and 2)&#8197;a more recent approach, based on cross&#8208;amyloid interactions. We discuss why peptide&#8208;based amyloid inhibitors, in particular their advanced generations, can be promising leads or candidates for anti&#8208;amyloid drugs as well as valuable tools for deciphering amyloid&#8208;mediated cell damage and its link to disease pathogenesis.

      <title>Uncovering the Neglected Similarities of Arynes and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Two sides of the same coin? Arynes and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes show striking similarities in their reactivity. This Minireview highlights analogous insertion and annulation reactions of these two strained species.







Abstract
Arynes and donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes are two classes of strained systems having the potential for numerous applications in organic synthesis. The last two decades have witnessed a renaissance of interest in the chemistry of these species primarily because of the mild and robust methods for their generation or activation. Commonly, arynes as easily polarizable systems result in 1,2&#8208;disubstitution, whereas D&#8208;A cyclopropanes as polarized systems lead to 1,3&#8208;bisfunctionalization thereby showing striking similarities. Transformations with 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;dipoles afford cyclic structures. With arynes, emerging four&#8208;membered rings as intermediates might react further, whereas the analogous five&#8208;membered rings obtained from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes are most often the final products. However, there are a few cases where these intermediates behave surprisingly differently. This Minireview highlights the parallels in reactivity between arynes and D&#8211;A cyclopropanes thereby shedding light on the neglected similarities of these two reactive species.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Polyhedra with Highly Entangled Faces Induced by Metal&#8211;Acetylene Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Pile, oligomerize, and tangle: The complexation of a twisted triarylmethane ligand with CuI or AgI ions afforded M6L4, M12L8, and M18L12 coordination polyhedra that can be considered as cross&#8208;linked and tangled oligomers of a hypothetical double&#8208;propeller M3L2 subunit supported by weak acetylene&#8211;&#960; coordination.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of nanostructures is dominated by a limited number of strong coordination elements. Herein, we show that metal&#8211;acetylene &#960;&#8208;coordination of a tripodal ligand (L) with acetylene spacers gave an M3L2 double&#8208;propeller motif (M=CuI or AgI), which dimerized into an M6L4 interlocked cage (M=CuI). Higher (M3L2)n oligomers were also selectively obtained: an M12L8 truncated tetrahedron (M=CuI) and an M18L12 truncated trigonal prism (M=AgI), both of which contain the same double&#8208;propeller motif. The higher oligomers exhibit multiply entangled facial structures that are classified as a trefoil knot and a Solomon link. The inner cavities of the structures encapsulate counteranions, revealing a potential new strategy towards the synthesis of functional hollow structures that is powered by molecular entanglements.
