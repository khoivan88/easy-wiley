      <title>Controlling Single Molecule Conductance by Chemical Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Among the prerequisites for the progress of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based electronic devices are a better understanding of the electronic properties at the individual molecular level and the development of methods to tune the charge transport through molecular junctions. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is an ideal tool not only for the characterization, but also for the manipulation of single atoms and molecules on surfaces.

The conductance through a single molecule can be measured by contacting the molecule with atomic precision and forming a molecular bridge between the metallic STM tip electrode and the metallic surface electrode. The parameters affecting the conductance are mainly related to their electronic structure and to the coupling to the metallic electrodes. Here, the experimental and theoretical analyses are focused on single tetracenothiophene molecules and demonstrate that an in&#8208;situ&#8208;induced direct desulfurization reaction of the thiophene moiety strongly improves the molecular anchoring by forming covalent bonds between molecular carbon and copper surface atoms. This bond formation leads to an increase of the conductance by about 50% compared to the initial state.</dc:description>

      <title>The Redox Coupling Effect in a Photocatalytic RuII&#8208;PdII Cage with TTF Guest as Electron Relay Mediator for Visible&#8208;Light Hydrogen&#8208;Evolving Promotion</title>
      <dc:description>
A nanospace coupling effect in a photocatalytic Ru(II)&#8211;Pd(II) cage via redox interplay between confined TTF guest and photosensitizing host for visible&#8208;light hydrogen&#8208;evolving promotion is described by C.&#8208;Y. Su and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913303). In the confined nanospace of a photocatalytic cage, the TTF guest acts as electron relay mediator to modulate the electron&#8208;transfer process through coupling with photoredox cycle of the cage, leading to significant improvement of hydrogen&#8208;evolving efficiency.

      <title>In Vitro Light&#8208;Up Visualization of Subunit&#8208;Specific Enzyme by an AIE Probe via Restriction of Single Molecular Motion</title>
      <dc:description>Generally, enzymes contain several subunits to maintain different biological functions in live systems. However, it still remains a great challenge for specific discrimination of one subunit over another. Toward this end, we present the first fluorescent probe TPEMA for highly specific detection of B subunit of cytosolic creatine (CK) kinase isoenzyme (CK&#8208;B). Due to its aggregation&#8208;induced emission property, TPEMA shows highly boosted emission toward CK&#8208;B with fast response time and very low interference from other analytes including M subunit of CK (CK&#8208;M). With the aid of Job's plot assay, ITC assay and molecular dynamics simulation, for the first time we directly confirmed that the remarkably enhanced fluorescence of TPEMA in the presence of CK&#8208;B results from the restriction of single molecular motion in the cavity. Selective wash&#8208;free fluorescence imaging of CK&#8208;B in macrophages under different treatments was successfully demonstrated. This work can shed much light on future fluorescent probes for light&#8208;up detection of other subunit&#8208;specific enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced Single&#8208;Electron Transfer as an Enabling Principle in the Radical Borylation of Alkenes with NHC&#8211;Borane</title>
      <dc:description>
A photoinduced SET process enables the direct B&#8722;H bond activation of NHC&#8211;boranes. The resulting NHC&#8211;boryl radical was used for the borylation of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes and alkenes with diverse electronic and structural features, providing facile access to highly functionalized borylated molecules.







Abstract
A photoinduced SET process enables the direct B&#8722;H bond activation of NHC&#8211;boranes. In contrast to common hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) strategies, this photoinduced reaction simply takes advantage of the beneficial redox potentials of NHC&#8211;boranes, thus obviating the need for extra radical initiators. The resulting NHC&#8211;boryl radical was used for the borylation of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes and alkenes with diverse electronic and structural features, providing facile access to highly functionalized borylated molecules. Labeling and photoquenching experiments provide insight into the mechanism of this photoinduced SET pathway.

      <title>Li/Garnet Interface Stabilization by Thermal&#8208;decomposition Vapor Deposition of an Amorphous Carbon Layer</title>
      <dc:description>Applying interlayers is the main strategy to address the large area specific resistance (ASR) of Li/garnet interface. However, studies on eliminating the Li  2  CO  3  and LiOH interfacial lithiophobic contaminants are still insufficient. Here, we propose thermal&#8208;decomposition vapor deposition (TVD) of a carbon modification layer on Li  6.75  La  3  Zr  1.75  Ta  0.25  O  12  (LLZTO), which provides a contaminant&#8208;free surface. Due to the protection of the carbon layer, the air stability of LLZTO is also improved. Moreover, owing to the amorphous structure of the low graphitized carbon (LGC), instant lithiation is achieved, and the ASR of the Li/LLZTO interface is reduced to 9 &#937; cm  2  . Lithium volatilization and Zr  4+  reduction are also controllable during TVD. Compared with its high graphitized carbon counterpart (HGC), the LGC&#8208;modified Li/LLZTO interface displays a higher critical current density of 1.2 mA/cm  2  , as well as moderate Li plating and stripping, which provides enhanced polarization voltage stability.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Unveiling the active phase of catalytic materials under reaction conditions is important for the designed construction of efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction to ammonia. Here, we probed the origin of the prominent activity enhancement for CuO (Faradaic efficiency: 95.8%, Selectivity: 81.2%) toward selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia.  15  N isotope labeling experiments proved that ammonia originated from nitrate reduction.

      <title>Synthesis of a hemispherical geodesic phenine framework via a polygon assembling strategy</title>
      <dc:description>A synthetic strategy to construct large geodesic structures of phenine (1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted benzene) was devised. The strategy assembled five pentagons on an omphalos pentagon and, bridging peripheral pentagons, furnished five additional hexagons. Thirty phenine units were synthetically assembled to afford a large C  220  H  180  molecule having a phenine framework isoreticular to a hemispherical, bisected segment of C  60  . Although a hemispherical structure of the phenine framework was suggested by solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra, the crystallographic analysis revealed an ovally deformed structure of the molecule. In&#8208;depth structural analyses including theoretical calculations showed that fluctuations at biaryl torsions allowed for the structural deformations and, at the same time, that the dynamic fluctuations resulted in the spectroscopic observation of the hemispherical structure as a time&#8208;averaged structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Approaching the Integer&#8208;Charge Transfer Regime in Molecularly Doped Oligothiophenes by Efficient Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A library of symmetrical linear oligothiophene has been prepared employing decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key transformation. We utilized thiophene potassium carboxylate salts as cross&#8208;coupling partners without the need of co&#8208;catalyst, base, or additives.

The modularity of this approach is demonstrated with the preparation of discreet oligothiophenes with up to 10 thiophene repeat units. Symmetrical oligothiophenes represent prototypical organic semiconductors and allow us to spectroscopically assess their response to molecular electrical doping regarding the degree of charge transfer as a function of the chain length. We find evidence that the critical length for integer charge transfer as it is found in the polythiophene limit to be not more than 10 thiophene units, which highlights the potential of long discreet oligothiophenes for their use in organic electronic applications as doped conduction or injection layers.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Fluorescence Imaging Spectroscopy for Mapping Low Concentrations of Red Lake Pigments: Van Gogh&#8217;s Painting The Olive Orchard</title>
      <dc:description>Vincent van Gogh used fugitive red lake pigments that have faded in some paintings. Mapping their distribution is key to understanding how his paintings have changed with time. While red lake pigments can be identified from microsamples, in situ identification and mapping remains a challenge. This paper explores the ability of molecular fluorescence imaging spectroscopy to identify and, more importantly, map residual non&#8208;degraded red lakes. The high sensitivity of this method enabled identification of the emission spectra of eosin (tetrabromine fluorescein) lake mixed with lead or zinc white at lower concentrations than elemental X&#8208;ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy used on account of bromine. The molecular fluorescence mapping of residual eosin and two carmine red lakes in van Gogh&#8217;s The Olive Orchard is demonstrated and compared with XRF imaging spectroscopy. The red lakes are consistent with the composition of paint tubes known to be used by van Gogh.</dc:description>

      <title>Semiconducting Polymer Dots with Dual&#8208;Enhanced NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence for Through&#8208;Skull Mouse&#8208;Brain Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular engineering is used to enhance NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence of polymer dots by managing the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects. The polymer dots enabled a remarkable improvement in penetration depth and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in through&#8208;skull and through&#8208;scalp fluorescent imaging of the cerebral vasculature of live mice.







Abstract
Fluorescence probes in the NIR&#8208;IIa region show drastically improved imaging owing to the reduced photon scattering and autofluorescence in biological tissues. Now, NIR&#8208;IIa polymer dots (Pdots) are developed with a dual fluorescence enhancement mechanism. First, the aggregation induced emission of phenothiazine was used to reduce the nonradiative decay pathways of the polymers in condensed states. Second, fluorescence quenching was minimized by different levels of steric hindrance to further boost the fluorescence. The resulting Pdots displayed a fluorescence QY of ca. 1.7&#8201;% in aqueous solution, suggesting an enhancement of ca. 21 times in comparison with the original polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. Small&#8208;animal imaging by using the NIR&#8208;IIa Pdots exhibited a remarkable improvement in penetration depth and signal to background ratio, as confirmed by through&#8208;skull and through&#8208;scalp fluorescent imaging of the cerebral vasculature of live mice.

      <title>Anti&#8208;aromatic vs. induced paratropicity: synthesis and interrogation of a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene with a proton placed directly above the central ring</title>
      <dc:description>We present a high yielding intramolecular oxidative coupling within a diazadioxa[10]helicene to give a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene. This is the first [n]circulene containing more the eight ortho annulated rings (n&gt;8). The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals a tight columnar packing, with a proton from a pendant naphthalene moiety centred directly above the central 9&#8208;membered ring. This distinct environment induces a significant magnetic deshielding effect on that particular proton as determined by  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The origin of the deshielding effect is investigated computationally by NICS values. It is established that the deshielding effect originates from an induced paratropic ring current from the seven aromatic rings of the [9]circulene structure, and not due to the nine&#8208;membered ring being antiaromatic. UV/vis spectroscopy reveals efficient conjugation in the prepared diazatrioxa[9]circulene compared to the parent helical azaoxa[10]helicenes, and DFT calculations, including energy levels, confirm the experimental observations.</dc:description>

      <title>An Oxygen Sensation: Progress in Macromolecule Hydroxylation Triggered by the Elucidation of Cellular Oxygen Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology 2019 was awarded for discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability. This Highlight acknowledges the impact of the laureates&#8217; contributions and summarises the history, molecular aspects, and current challenges of research on how oxygen regulates gene expression. Opportunities for molecular scientists in the field of macromolecule hydroxylation are emphasised.







Abstract
The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine honours three scientists that devoted their careers to pursuing an audacious basic science question: by what mechanisms do animals sense oxygen, and how can cells adapt to a lack of oxygen? The identification of the human hypoxia inducible factor pathway has enabled new approaches for the therapy of related diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, anaemia, and stroke. The intricate molecular details of oxygen sensing broadened interest in the family of iron&#8208; and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases known from elaborate natural product chemistry, and catalysed major progress in macromolecule hydroxylation. The laureates&#8217; work enables numerous avenues for molecular scientists, from C&#8722;H activation chemistry to PROTAC technology, medicinal chemistry, and epigenetics.

      <title>Electrochemical Difunctionalization of Alkenes by a Four&#8208;Component Reaction Cascade Mumm Rearrangement: Rapid Access to Functionalized Imides</title>
      <dc:description>
Collect four: A four&#8208;component reaction based on arylethylenes, aryl acids, acetonitrile, and alcohols has been designed that enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and the formation of imides under electrochemical conditions. Mechanistic studies support a 1,3&#8208;(O&#8594;N) acyl transfer of O&#8208;acyl isoamides via Mumm rearrangement.







Abstract
An electrochemical four&#8208;component reaction cascade Mumm rearrangement was developed. It is a rare example of in&#8197;situ generation of O&#8208;acyl isoamides for 1,3&#8208;(O&#8594;N) acyl transfer. Inexpensive, commercially available arylethylenes, aryl or heterocyclic acids, acetonitrile, and alcohols were used as substrates. A wide range of aryl acids and alcohols were tolerated and provided imides in satisfactory yields. Subsequent hydrolysis of imides could be utilized to synthesize valuable amides and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives.

      <dc:description>
I have a tiara! Tiara[5]arenes, a class of five&#8208;fold symmetric oligophenol macrocycles, which is not accessible by direct phenol&#8208;formaldehyde condensation, was synthesized through the metamorphosis of pillar[5]arenes.







Abstract
Tiara[5]arenes (T[5]s), a new class of five&#8208;fold symmetric oligophenolic macrocycles that are not accessible from the addition of formaldehyde to phenol, were synthesized for the first time. These pillar[5]arene&#8208;derived structures display both unique conformational freedom, differing from that of pillararenes, with a rich blend of solid&#8208;state conformations and excellent host&#8211;guest interactions in solution. Finally we show how this novel macrocyclic scaffold can be functionalized in a variety of ways and used as functional crystalline materials to distinguish uniquely between benzene and cyclohexane.

      <title>Remote Perfluoroalkyl Substituents are Key to Living Aqueous Ethylene Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
A good influence: Long perfluoroalkyl substituents at remote positions of the ligand can influence the active center of nickel(II) salicylaldiminato catalysts to operate with higher activities and deliver linear polyethylene of higher molecular weights.







Abstract
In various nickel(II) salicylaldiminato ethylene polymerization catalysts, which are a versatile mechanistic probe for substituent effects, longer perfluoroalkyl groups exert a strong effect on catalytic activities and polymer microstructures compared to the trifluoromethyl group. This effect is accounted for by a reduced electron density on the active sites, and is also supported by electrochemical studies. Thus, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, the key step of chain transfer and branching pathways, is disfavored while chain&#8208;growth rates are enhanced. This enhancement occurs to an extent that enables living polymerizations in aqueous systems to afford ultra&#8208;high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene for various chelating salicylaldimine motifs. These findings are mechanistically instructive as well as practically useful for illustrating the potential of perfluoroalkyl groups in catalyst design.

      <title>2D and 3D Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks: The Influence of Dimensionality on Functionality</title>
      <dc:description>
2D vs. 3D COFs: To demonstrate the influence of dimensionality on COF functionality, 2D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF and 3D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF were synthesized. The results showed that, compared to 2D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF, 3D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF not only displays higher CO2 adsorption capacity but also exhibits better photocatalytic performance and size selectivity.







Abstract
The construction of 2D and 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from functional moieties for desired properties has gained much attention. However, the influence of COFs dimensionality on their functionalities, which can further assist in COF design, has never been explored. Now, by selecting designed precursors and topology diagrams, 2D and 3D porphyrinic COFs (2D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF and 3D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF) are synthesized. By model building and Rietveld refinement of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, 2D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF crystallizes as 2D sheets while 3D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF adopts a five&#8208;fold interpenetrated pts topology. Interestingly, compared with 2D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF, 3D&#8208;PdPor&#8208;COF showed interesting properties, including 1)&#8197;higher CO2 adsorption capacity; 2)&#8197;better photocatalytic performance; and 3)&#8197;size&#8208;selective photocatalysis. Based on this study, we believe that with the incorporation of functional moieties, the dimensionality of COFs can definitely influence their functionalities.

Abstract
Over the past several decades, the Nobel Prize program has slowly but steadily been modified in both transparent and opaque ways. A transparent change has been the creation of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. An opaque change has been the mutation of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry into what is effectively the &#8220;Nobel Prize in Chemistry or Life Sciences.&#8221; This paper presents a detailed study of this opaque change, including evidence that the disciplines of chemistry and biochemistry cover, today, intellectually quite distinct and generally scientifically&#8208;unrelated intellectual territory. This paper supports the evolution of the Nobel Prizes, and encourages the Nobel Prize program to move from opaque to transparent change processes for the next generations of achievement in the sciences.

      <title>Carbon Dots as a Promising Green Photocatalyst for Free Radical and ATRP&#8208;Based Radical Photopolymerization with Blue LEDs</title>
      <dc:description>
On the dot: Carbon dots isolated from seaweed work well as a photocatalyst and sensitizer in living and free radical polymerization, while their low cytotoxic activity makes them interesting for medical applications.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have been used for the first time as a sensitizer to initiate and activate free radical and controlled radical polymerization, respectively, based on an ATRP protocol with blue LEDs. Consideration of diverse heteroatom&#8208;doped CDs indicated that N&#8208;doped CDs could serve as an effective photocatalyst and photosensitizer in combination with LEDs emitting either at 405&#8197;nm or 470&#8197;nm. Free radical polymerization was initiated by combining the CDs with an iodonium or sulfonium salt in tri(propylene glycol) diacrylate. Polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) by photo&#8208;induced ATRP was achieved with CDs and ethyl &#945;&#8208;bromophenylacetate using CuII as catalyst in the ppm range. The polymers obtained showed temporal control, narrower dispersity &#8818;1.5, and chain&#8208;end fidelity. The first&#8208;order kinetics and ON/OFF experiments additionally gave evidence of the constant concentration of polymer radicals. No remarkable cytotoxic activity was observed for the CDs, underlining their biocompatibility.

      <title>Photoinduced Mo&#8722;CN Bond Breakage in Octacyanomolybdate Leading to Spin Triplet Trapping</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal structure of K4Mo(CN)8&#8901;2&#8201;H2O recorded at 10&#8197;K after blue&#8208;light irradiation reveals the light&#8208;induced cleavage of one Mo&#8722;CN bond from the initial octacoordinated complex, concomitant with the photoinduced formation of a paramagnetic signal.







Abstract
The photoinduced properties of the octacoordinated complex K4MoIV(CN)8&#8901;2&#8201;H2O were studied by theoretical calculations, crystallography, and optical and magnetic measurements. The crystal structure recorded at 10&#8197;K after blue light irradiation reveals an heptacoordinated Mo(CN)7 species originating from the light&#8208;induced cleavage of one Mo&#8722;CN bond, concomitant with the photoinduced formation of a paramagnetic signal. When this complex is heated to 70&#8197;K, it returns to its original diamagnetic ground state, demonstrating full reversibility. The photomagnetic properties show a partial conversion into a triplet state possessing significant magnetic anisotropy, which is in agreement with theoretical studies. Inspired by these results, we isolated the new compound [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[MoIV(CN)7]&#8901;3&#8201;CH3CN using a photochemical pathway, confirming that photodissociation leads to a stable heptacyanomolybdate(IV) species in solution.

      <title>Photosensitized Intermolecular Carboimination of Alkenes through the Persistent Radical Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
Two birds, one stone: Oxime esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids were used as a bifunctional source of both C&#8208; and N&#8208;radicals. The persistency of the N&#8208;radicals enables highly selective intermolecular radical carboaminations of alkenes.







Abstract
An intermolecular, two&#8208;component vicinal carboimination of alkenes has been accomplished by energy transfer catalysis. Oxime esters of alkyl carboxylic acids were used as bifunctional reagents to generate both alkyl and iminyl radicals. Subsequently, addition of the alkyl radical to an alkene generates a transient radical for selective radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling with the persistent iminyl radical. Furthermore, this process provides direct access to aliphatic primary amines and &#945;&#8208;amino acids by simple hydrolysis.

      <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Tandem Defunctionalization of Biorenewable Ferulic acid and Derivates into Bio&#8208;Catechol</title>
      <dc:description>
Ferulic acid, a bio&#8208;renewable compound derived from rice bran, has been transformed in catechol, a major commodity chemical, using HCl and water. The protocol is applicable to a variety of other (biorenewable) substrates.







Abstract
An efficient conversion of biorenewable ferulic acid into bio&#8208;catechol has been developed. The transformation comprises two consecutive defunctionalizations of the substrate, that is, C&#8722;O (demethylation) and C&#8722;C (de&#8208;2&#8208;carboxyvinylation) bond cleavage, occurring in one step. The process only requires heating of ferulic acid with HCl (or H2SO4) as catalyst in pressurized hot water (250&#8201;&#176;C, 50&#8197;bar N2). The versatility is shown on a variety of other (biorenewable) substrates yielding up to 84&#8201;% di&#8208; (catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone) and trihydroxybenzenes (pyrogallol, hydroxyquinol), in most cases just requiring simple extraction as work&#8208;up.

Abstract
A direct and enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of racemic 2,2&#8208;diarylacetonitriles with electron&#8208;rich (hetero)arenes has been described, which allows for efficient construction of triarylmethanes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with excellent chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

      <title>Highly Enantioselective Construction of Strained Spiro[2,3]hexanes through a Michael Addition/Ring Expansion/Cyclization Cascade</title>
      <dc:description>
Round, like a circle in a spiral: Highly strained spiro[2,3]hexane skeletons are accessed from readily prepared starting materials through a Michael addition/ring expansion/cycloaddition cascade. The process does not require metals, proceeds through organocatalysis, can be carried out on a gram scale, and gives three continuous carbon stereocenters with good enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein report a general organocatalytic enantioselective strategy for the construction of highly strained spiro[2,3]hexane skeletons from methylenecyclopropanes and a broad selection of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The reaction proceeds through a Michael addition followed by ring expansion of methylenecyclopropanes and nucleophilic attack of an enamine to realize the construction of spiro[2,3]hexanes. Key to the success of this approach are the utilization of an electron&#8208;deficient difluoro&#8208;substituted secondary amine catalyst and the intrinsic reactivity of methylenecyclopropanes.

      <title>Reduction of Activated Alkenes by PIII/PV Redox Cycling Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
The organocatalytic reduction of activated alkenes to the corresponding alkanes has been realized by phosphorus redox cycling, with water as the hydrogen source and 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a methyl&#8208;substituted phosphetane oxide as the catalyst. The process is highly selective towards activated double bonds, tolerating a variety of functional groups that are usually prone to reduction.







Abstract
The carbon&#8211;carbon double bond of unsaturated carbonyl compounds was readily reduced by using a phosphetane oxide catalyst in the presence of a simple organosilane as the terminal reductant and water as the hydrogen source. Quantitative hydrogenation was observed when 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a methyl&#8208;substituted phosphetane oxide was employed as the catalyst. The procedure is highly selective towards activated double bonds, tolerating a variety of functional groups that are usually prone to reduction. In total, 25 alkenes and two alkynes were hydrogenated to the corresponding alkanes in excellent yields of up to 99&#8201;%. Notably, less active poly(methylhydrosiloxane) could also be utilized as the terminal reductant. Mechanistic investigations revealed the phosphane as the catalyst resting state and a protonation/deprotonation sequence as the crucial step in the catalytic cycle.

      <title>Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Unfunctionalized Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting a hold of unfunctionalized alkenes: Optimization of the ligand in the iridium catalyst enables the asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of unfunctionalized tetrasubstituted acyclic olefins, which installs two vicinal stereocenters with excellent stereoselectivies.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation has evolved as one of the most powerful tools to construct stereocenters. However, the asymmetric hydrogenation of unfunctionalized tetrasubstituted acyclic olefins remains the pinnacle of asymmetric synthesis and an unsolved challenge. We report herein the discovery of an iridium catalyst for the first, generally applicable, highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation of such olefins and the mechanistic insights of the reaction. The power of this chemistry is demonstrated by the successful hydrogenation of a wide variety of electronically and sterically diverse olefins in excellent yield and high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

      <title>&#8220;Design of Experiments&#8221; as a Method to Optimize Dynamic Disulfide Assemblies: Cages and Functionalizable Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>
Eight new macrocycles with reactive functional handles were synthesized through metalloid&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly. &#8220;Design of experiments&#8221; was utilized to optimize reaction conditions for multiple systems to significantly increase the yield of a single, targeted macrocycle.







Abstract
Cyclophanes are a venerable class of macrocyclic and cage compounds that often contain unusual conformations, high strain, and unusual properties. However, synthesis of complex, functional derivatives remains difficult due to low functional group tolerance, high dilution, extreme reaction conditions, and sometimes low yields using traditional stepwise synthetic methods. &#8220;Design of experiments&#8221; (DOE) is a method employed for the optimization of reaction conditions, and we showcase this approach to generate a dramatic increase in the yield of specific targets from two different self&#8208;assembling systems. These examples demonstrate that DOE provides an additional tool in tuning self&#8208;assembling, dynamic covalent systems.

      <title>Water Purification and Microplastics Removal Using Magnetic Polyoxometalate&#8208;Supported Ionic Liquid Phases (magPOM&#8208;SILPs)</title>
      <dc:description>
Clean machine: A three&#8208;component composite allows the magnetic removal of organic, inorganic, microbial, and microplastic pollutants from water. Magnetic Fe2O3/SiO2 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles are functionalized with a polyoxometalate ionic liquid. The composite can be dispersed in water, binds multiple pollutants and can be fully recovered with a permanent magnet.







Abstract
Filtration is an established water&#8208;purification technology. However, due to low flow rates, the filtration of large volumes of water is often not practical. Herein, we report an alternative purification approach in which a magnetic nanoparticle composite is used to remove organic, inorganic, microbial, and microplastics pollutants from water. The composite is based on a polyoxometalate ionic liquid (POM&#8208;IL) adsorbed onto magnetic microporous core&#8211;shell Fe2O3/SiO2 particles, giving a magnetic POM&#8208;supported ionic liquid phase (magPOM&#8208;SILP). Efficient, often quantitative removal of several typical surface water pollutants is reported together with facile removal of the particles using a permanent magnet. Tuning of the composite components could lead to new materials for centralized and decentralized water purification systems.

Abstract
Trypanosoma protozoan parasites are the causative agents of Chagas disease and sleeping sickness, two neglected tropical diseases where there is an urgent need for improved treatments and the evaluation of promising drug leads like the actinoallolides. Enabled by the highly stereocontrolled aldol reactions of three chiral ketone building blocks, an efficient first total synthesis of the potent anti&#8208;trypanosomal macrolide (+)&#8208;actinoallolide&#8197;A has been achieved in 17 steps and 8&#8201;% overall yield.

      <title>Emerging Electron Microscopy Techniques for Probing Functional Interfaces in Energy Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Research on functional interfaces in energy materials should benefit from emerging electron microscopy techniques based on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS). In this Minireview the basic principles behind 4D&#8208;STEM, monochromated EELS, and cryo&#8208;STEM will be introduced and the current state of each will be concisely outlined.







Abstract
Interfaces play a fundamental role in many areas of chemistry. However, their localized nature requires characterization techniques with high spatial resolution in order to fully understand their structure and properties. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art atomic resolution or in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy are indispensable tools for characterizing the local structure and chemistry of materials with single&#8208;atom resolution, but they are not able to measure many properties that dictate function, such as vibrational modes or charge transfer, and are limited to room&#8208;temperature samples containing no liquids. Here, we outline emerging electron microscopy techniques that are allowing these limitations to be overcome and highlight several recent studies that were enabled by these techniques. We then provide a vision for how these techniques can be paired with each other and with in situ methods to deliver new insights into the static and dynamic behavior of functional interfaces.

      <title>N&#8208;Confused Phlorin&#8208;Prodigiosin Chimera: meso&#8208;Aryl Oxidation and &#960;&#8208;Extension Triggered by Peripheral Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>
On the periphery: Peripheral coordination of PdII and BF2 with N&#8208;confused phlorin&#8208;prodigiosin chimera triggered unique reactions in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). In the case of PdII, the meso&#8208;phenyl group undergoes oxidation and in the case of BF2, there is &#960;&#8197;extension through a N,N&#8208;diethylaminovinyl group.







Abstract
An N&#8208;confused phlorin isomer bearing a dipyrrin moiety at the &#945;&#8208;position of the confused pyrrole ring (1) was synthesized. PdII and BIII coordination at the peripheral prodigiosin&#8208;like moiety of 1 afforded the corresponding complexes 2 and 3. Reflux of 2 in triethylamine (TEA) converted the meso&#8208;phenyl into the PdII&#8208;coordinating phenoxy group to afford 4. Under the same reaction conditions, TEA was linked to the &#945;&#8208;position of the dipyrrin unit in 3 as an N,N&#8208;diethylaminovinyl group to afford 5. Furthermore, peripheral coordination of BIII in 3 and 5 improved the planarity of the phlorin macrocycle and thus facilitated the coordination of AgIII at the inner cavity to afford 3&#8208;Ag and 5&#8208;Ag, respectively. These results provide an effective approach for developing unique porphyrinoids through peripheral coordination.

      <title>The Critical Role of Reductive Steps in the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis and Hydrolysis of Aryl Ether C&#8722;O Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
In water or in decalin: The significant deuterium kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD=5.7) of the hydrogenolysis of diphenyl ether on nickel and the positive dependence of the rate on the H2 chemical potential point to a mechanism in which cleavage of the aromatic ether bond proceeds in a concerted fashion with ipso&#8208;H addition to the phenyl ring.







Abstract
The hydrogenolysis of the aromatic C&#8722;O bond in aryl ethers catalyzed by Ni was studied in decalin and water. Observations of a significant kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD=5.7) for the reactions of diphenyl ether under H2 and D2 atmosphere and a positive dependence of the rate on H2 chemical potential in decalin indicate that addition of H to the aromatic ring is involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step. All kinetic evidence points to the fact that H&#8197;addition occurs concerted with C&#8722;O bond scission. DFT calculations also suggest a route consistent with these observations involving hydrogen atom addition to the ipso position of the phenyl ring concerted with C&#8722;O scission. Hydrogenolysis initiated by H addition in water is more selective (ca. 75&#8201;%) than reactions in decalin (ca. 30&#8201;%).

      <title>Expanding the Toolbox of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks via Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
The toolbox of metal&#8211;phenolic networks is expanded by enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, where a range of monophenols are converted into catechol&#8208;containing molecules and cross&#8208;linked by metal ions. This strategy preserves functionality of the monophenol precursors, while conferring benefits of catechol&#8208;containing molecules (e.g., universal adhesion) to the networks.







Abstract
Functional coatings are of considerable interest because of their fundamental implications for interfacial assembly and promise for numerous applications. Universally adherent materials have recently emerged as versatile functional coatings; however, such coatings are generally limited to catechol, (ortho&#8208;diphenol)&#8208;containing molecules, as building blocks. Here, we report a facile, biofriendly enzyme&#8208;mediated strategy for assembling a wide range of molecules (e.g., 14 representative molecules in this study) that do not natively have catechol moieties, including small molecules, peptides, and proteins, on various surfaces, while preserving the molecule's inherent function, such as catalysis (&#8776;80&#8201;% retention of enzymatic activity for trypsin). Assembly is achieved by in situ conversion of monophenols into catechols via tyrosinase, where films form on surfaces via covalent and coordination cross&#8208;linking. The resulting coatings are robust, functional (e.g., in protective coatings, biological imaging, and enzymatic catalysis), and versatile for diverse secondary surface&#8208;confined reactions (e.g., biomineralization, metal ion chelation, and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide conjugation).

      <title>Efficient Organocatalytic Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane</title>
      <dc:description>
H2 go: Efficient dehydrogenation of ammonia borane by the organic catalyst 6&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;thiopyridone is described. Mechanistic investigations show that the reaction commences with dehydrogenative S&#8722;B coupling. An inorganic retro&#8208;ene reaction closes the catalytic cycle and regenerates the catalyst.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of ammonia borane by sterically encumbered pyridones as organocatalysts is reported. With 6&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;thiopyridone as the catalyst, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 88&#8197;h&#8722;1 was achieved. Experimental mechanistic investigations, substantiated by DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) computations, indicate a mechanistic scenario that commences with the protonation of a B&#8722;H bond by the mercaptopyridine form of the catalyst. The reactive intermediate formed by this initial protonation was observed by NMR spectroscopy and the molecular structure of a surrogate determined by SCXRD. An intramolecular proton transfer in this intermediate from the NH3 group to the pyridine ring with concomitant breaking of the S&#8722;B bond regenerates the thiopyridone and closes the catalytic cycle. This step can be described as an inorganic retro&#8208;ene reaction.

With 6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;thiopyridone as the catalyst, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 88&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved. Experimental mechanistic investigations, substantiated by DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) computations, indicate a mechanistic scenario that commences with the protonation of a B&#8722;H bond by the mercaptopyridine form of the catalyst. The reactive intermediate formed by this initial protonation was observed by NMR spectroscopy and the molecular structure of a surrogate determined by SCXRD. An intramolecular proton transfer in this intermediate from the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group to the pyridine ring with concomitant breaking of the S&#8722;B bond regenerates the thiopyridone and closes the catalytic cycle. This step can be described as an inorganic retro&#8208;ene reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stereospecific and Chemoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deaminative Silylation of Benzylic Ammonium Triflates</title>
      <dc:description>
SiR, the NMe has surrendered: Benzylic ammonium salts can be transformed into the corresponding silanes by a copper&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;type displacement. The enantioenrichment of the precursors is completely retained in the &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of benzylsilanes starting from the corresponding ammonium triflates is reported. Silyl boronic esters are employed as silicon pronucleophiles, and the reaction is catalyzed by copper(I) salts. Enantioenriched benzylic ammonium salts react stereospecifically through an SN2&#8208;type displacement of the ammonium group to afford &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes with inversion of the configuration. A cyclopropyl&#8208;substituted substrate does not undergo ring opening, thus suggesting an ionic reaction mechanism with no benzyl radical intermediate.

      <title>Direct Evidence of Local pH Change and the Role of Alkali Cation during CO2 Electroreduction in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>
Local pH detection: A pH&#8208;dependent electroactive product from the electroreduction of CO2 can be used as a molecular probe, thereby allowing in situ detection of local pH changes during CO2 electroreduction using a rotating ring disc electrode assembly.







Abstract
We report, for the first time, utilizing a rotating ring&#8208;disc electrode (RRDE) assembly for detecting changes in the local pH during aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Using Au as a model catalyst where CO is the only product, we show that the CO oxidation peak shifts by &#8722;86&#177;2&#8197;mV/pH during CO2RR, which can be used to directly quantify the change in the local pH near the catalyst surface during electrolysis. We then applied this methodology to investigate the role of cations in affecting the local pH during CO2RR and find that during CO2RR to CO on Au in an MHCO3 buffer (where M is an alkali metal), the experimentally measured local basicity decreased in the order Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+ &gt; Cs+, which agreed with an earlier theoretical prediction by Singh et&#8197;al. Our results also reveal that the formation of CO is independent of the cation. In summary, RRDE is a versatile tool for detecting local pH change over a diverse range of CO2RR catalysts. Additionally, using the product itself (i.e. CO) as the local pH probe allows us to investigate CO2RR without the interference of additional probe molecules introduced to the system. Most importantly, considering that most CO2RR products have pH&#8208;dependent oxidation, RRDE can be a powerful tool for determining the local pH and correlating the local pH to reaction selectivity.

      <title>Selective Synthesis of Conjugated Chiral Macrocycles: Sidewall Segments of (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;(12,4) Carbon Nanotubes with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Segments: For the first time, two chiral conjugated macrocycles ([4]CAn2,6), as (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;(12,4) carbon nanotube segments, are synthesized and the physical properties studied. The hoop&#8208;shaped molecules can be directly viewed by an STM technique. Chiral enantiomers with (&#8722;)/(+)&#8197;helicity of the [4]CAn2,6 were successfully isolated. These new tubular chiral carbon nanotube segments exhibit strong circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.1).







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unusual physical properties that are valuable for nanotechnology and electronics, but the chemical synthesis of chirality&#8208; and diameter&#8208;specific CNTs and &#960;&#8208;conjugated CNT segments is still a great challenge. Reported here are the selective syntheses, isolations, characterizations, and photophysical properties of two novel chiral conjugated macrocycles ([4]cyclo&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthracene; [4]CAn2,6), as (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;(12,4) carbon nanotube segments. These conjugated macrocyclic molecules were obtained using a bottom&#8208;up assembly approach and subsequent reductive elimination reaction. The hoop&#8208;shaped molecules can be directly viewed by a STM technique. In addition, chiral enantiomers with (&#8722;)/(+)&#8197;helicity of the [4]CAn2,6 were successfully isolated by HPLC. The new tubular CNT segments exhibit large absorption and photoluminescence redshifts compared to the monomer unit. The carbon enantiomers are also observed to show strong circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.1). The results reported here expand the scope of materials design for bottom&#8208;up synthesis of chiral macrocycles and enrich existing knowledge of their optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed E&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Terminal Alkynes: A Mechanism Involving Cobalt(0/II) Redox Cycles</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkyne crossing: A new catalyst system for E&#8208;selective cross&#8208;dimerization of two terminal alkynes to access a variety of 1,3&#8208;enynes is reported. A dichlorocobalt(II) complex bearing 2,9&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline serves as the catalyst. A catalytically active cobalt(0) complex was successfully isolated, strongly suggesting that cobalt(0/II) redox processes are involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
A highly E&#8208;selective cross&#8208;dimerization of terminal alkynes with either terminal silylacetylenes, tert&#8208;butylacetylene, or 1&#8208;trimethylsilyloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;propyne in the presence of a dichlorocobalt(II) complex bearing a sterically demanding 2,9&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, activated with two equivalents of EtMgBr, gives a variety of (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes. A well&#8208;characterized diolefin/cobalt(0) complex, with divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, acted as a catalytically active species without any activation, clearly indicating that a cobalt(0) species is involved in the catalytic cycle.

      <title>Pyridine/Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Helical Foldamer Ion Channels with Exceptionally High K+/Na+ Selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Return to the fold: Aromatic foldamer helical channels were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot polymerization strategy using various amide&#8208;coupling agents. Channels up to 2.7&#8197;nm in length were created. The 3&#8197;&#197; wide and electron&#8208;rich cavity of the channels exhibits highly active and exceptionally selective transport of K+ ions, with a K+/Na+ selectivity of as much as 16.3 achieved by channels with an average length of 2.3&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Protein channels are characterized by high transport selectivity, which is essential for maintaining cellular function.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Return to the fold&lt;/b&gt;: Aromatic foldamer helical channels were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot polymerization strategy using various amide&#8208;coupling agents. Channels up to 2.7&#8197;nm in length were created. The 3&#8197;&#197; wide and electron&#8208;rich cavity of the channels exhibits highly active and exceptionally selective transport of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity of as much as 16.3 achieved by channels with an average length of 2.3&#8197;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Protein channels are characterized by high transport selectivity, which is essential for maintaining cellular function. Efforts to reproduce such high selectivity over the past four decades have not been very successful. We report a novel series of aromatic foldamer&#8208;based polymeric channels where the backbone is stabilized by differential electrostatic repulsions among heteroatoms helically arrayed along the helical backbone. Nanotubes averaging 2.3 and 2.7&#8197;nm in length mediate highly efficient transport of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions as a consequence of hydrophilic electron&#8208;rich hollow cavities that are 3&#8197;&#197; in diameter.

      <title>Detecting Counterion Dynamics in DNA&#8211;Protein Association</title>
      <dc:description>
Ion atmosphere: The condensation of cations around DNA and their release upon DNA&#8211;protein association have been proposed to contribute to binding thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize the ion atmosphere around DNA and directly detect the release of cations upon DNA&#8211;protein association. This release is observed as an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient Dapp of cations.







Abstract
Due to a high density of negative charges on its surface, DNA condenses cations as counterions, forming the so&#8208;called &#8220;ion atmosphere&#8221;. Although the release of counterions upon DNA&#8211;protein association has been postulated to have a major contribution to the binding thermodynamics, this release remains to be confirmed through a direct observation of the ions. Herein, we report the characterization of the ion atmosphere around DNA using NMR spectroscopy and directly detect the release of counterions upon DNA&#8211;protein association. NMR&#8208;based diffusion data reveal the highly dynamic nature of counterions within the ion atmosphere around DNA. Counterion release is observed as an increase in the apparent ionic diffusion coefficient, which directly provides the number of counterions released upon DNA&#8211;protein association.

      <title>Identification of Catalytic Sites for Oxygen Reduction in Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbons with Encapsulated Metal Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
ORR inspiring: With a low&#8208;temperature NH4Cl treatment graphene&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) are etched out of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Removing these metallic NPs greatly enhances the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity allowing the real catalytic centres to be identified.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C materials as efficient non&#8208;precious metal (NPM) catalysts for catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as alternatives to platinum is important for the practical use of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, metal&#8208;N&#8208;C materials have high structural heterogeneity. As a result of their high&#8208;temperature synthesis they often consist of metal&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated metal nanoparticles. Thus it is hard to identify the active structure of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature NH4Cl&#8208;treatment to etch out graphene&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles from metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts without destruction of co&#8208;existing atomically dispersed metal&#8208;Nx sites. Catalytic activity is much enhanced by this selective removal of metallic nanoparticles. Accordingly, we can confirm the spectator role of graphene&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles and the pivotal role of metal&#8208;Nx sites in the metal&#8208;N&#8208;C materials for ORR in the acidic medium.

      <title>Deciphering an Abnormal Layered&#8208;Tunnel Heterostructure Induced by Chemical Substitution for the Sodium Oxide Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>
An abnormal layered&#8208;tunnel heterostructure Na0.44Co0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode material induced by chemical element substitution is described. The crystal&#8208;structure engineering strategy that was used gives an outlook into high&#8208;performance sodium ion batteries.







Abstract
Demands for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems have driven the development of layered transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes for room&#8208;temperature rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Now, an abnormal layered&#8208;tunnel heterostructure Na0.44Co0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode material induced by chemical element substitution is reported. By virtue of beneficial synergistic effects, this layered&#8208;tunnel electrode shows outstanding electrochemical performance in sodium half&#8208;cell system and excellent compatibility with hard carbon anode in sodium full&#8208;cell system. The underlying formation process, charge compensation mechanism, phase transition, and sodium&#8208;ion storage electrochemistry are clearly articulated and confirmed through combined analyses of in&#8197;situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as operando X&#8208;ray diffraction. This crystal structure engineering regulation strategy offers a future outlook into advanced cathode materials for SIBs.

Abstract
A novel straightforward method for aryl azides having functional groups based on generation and reactions of aryllithiums bearing a triazene group from polybromoarenes using flow microreactor systems was achieved. The present approach will serve as a powerful method in organolithium chemistry and open a new possibility in the synthesis of polyfunctional organic azides.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of a Macrocyclic PROTAC</title>
      <dc:description>
Closing the circle: A macrocyclic PROTAC has been designed and synthesized by adding a cyclizing linker to MZ1, a PROTAC targeting the bromodomain of the BET protein, Brd4. A co&#8208;crystal structure of macroPROTAC&#8208;1 bound in a ternary complex with E3 ligase VHL and the second bromodomain of Brd4 validated the rational design. This macrocyclization strategy enhanced the target specificity and cellular activity of the PROTAC.







Abstract
Constraining a molecule in its bioactive conformation via macrocyclization represents an attractive strategy to rationally design functional chemical probes. While this approach has been applied to enzyme inhibitors or receptor antagonists, to date it remains unprecedented for bifunctional molecules that bring proteins together, such as PROTAC degraders. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a macrocyclic PROTAC by adding a cyclizing linker to the BET degrader MZ1. A co&#8208;crystal structure of macroPROTAC&#8208;1 bound in a ternary complex with VHL and the second bromodomain of Brd4 validated the rational design. Biophysical studies revealed enhanced discrimination between the second and the first bromodomains of BET proteins. Despite a 12&#8208;fold loss of binary binding affinity for Brd4, macroPROTAC&#8208;1 exhibited cellular activity comparable to MZ1. Our findings support macrocyclization as an advantageous strategy to enhance PROTAC degradation potency and selectivity between homologous targets.

      <title>Yttrium&#8208;86 Is a Positron Emitting Surrogate of Gadolinium for Noninvasive Quantification of Whole&#8208;Body Distribution of Gadolinium&#8208;Based Contrast Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Yttrium&#8208;86 PET imaging can inform on the clearance and biodistribution of the gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents used in MRI. Trace amounts of contrast agent can be detected in kidney 48&#8197;h post injection in rodents.







Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used to provide diagnostic information in clinical magnetic resonance (MR) examinations. Gadolinium (Gd) has been detected in the brain, bone and skin of patients, months and years following GBCA administration, raising concerns about long term toxicity. Despite increased scrutiny, the concentration, chemical form and fate of the retained gadolinium species remain unknown. Importantly, the whole body biodistribution and organ clearance of GBCAs is poorly understood in humans. Gadolinium lacks suitable isotopes for nuclear imaging. We demonstrate that the yttrium&#8208;86 isotope can be used as a gadolinium surrogate. We show that Gd and their analogous Y complexes have similar properties both in solution and in vivo, and that yttrium&#8208;86 PET can be used to track the biodistribution of GBCAs over a two&#8208;day period.

      <title>An Engineered Superhydrophilic/Superaerophobic Electrocatalyst Composed of the Supported CoMoSx Chalcogel for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Got to split! A CoMoSx chalcogel was synthesized in situ on nickel foam (NF) to give superhydrophilic/superaerophobic CoMoSx/NF, which served as a highly efficient catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions owing to the enhanced departure of gas bubbles. The overall water splitting device delivered a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.89&#8197;V and maintained its activity without decay for 100&#8197;h.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for large&#8208;scale water splitting is critical but also challenging. In this study, a hierarchical CoMoSx chalcogel was synthesized on a nickel foam (NF) through an in situ metathesis reaction and demonstrated excellent activity and stability in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The high catalytic activity could be ascribed to the abundant active sites/defects in the amorphous framework and promotion of activity through cobalt doping. Furthermore, the superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of micro&#8208;/nanostructured CoMoSx/NF promoted mass transfer by facilitating access of electrolytes and ensuring fast release of gas bubbles. By employing CoMoSx/NF as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the overall water splitting device delivered a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.89&#8197;V and maintained its activity without decay for 100&#8197;h.

Caught in the act: Direct detection of CO2 as a marker for carbon oxidation in alkaline electrolytes is now possible using a novel DEMS cell (DEMS=differential electrochemical mass spectrometry) and a specially designed experimental procedure. A high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst loading on carbon suppresses carbon corrosion in alkaline media.







Abstract
Carbon corrosion at high anodic potentials is a major source of instability, especially in acidic electrolytes and impairs the long&#8208;term functionality of electrodes. In&#8208;depth investigation of carbon corrosion in alkaline environment by means of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) is prevented by the conversion of CO2 into CO32&#8722;. We report the adaptation of a DEMS system for online CO2 detection as the product of carbon corrosion in alkaline electrolytes. A new cell design allows for in&#8197;situ acidification of the electrolyte to release initially dissolved CO32&#8722; as CO2 in front of the DEMS membrane and its subsequent detection by mass spectrometry. DEMS studies of a carbon&#8208;supported nickel boride (NixB/C) catalyst and Vulcan XC 72 at high anodic potentials suggest protection of carbon in the presence of highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Most importantly, carbon corrosion is decreased in alkaline solution.

      <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Diffusion Barriers in Pt/Beta Zeolite Catalyzed Isomerization of n&#8208;Heptane</title>
      <dc:description>
Diffusion barriers on interfaces: There exist very strong internal diffusion barriers in Beta zeolites, which subsequently reduce their activity and selectivity in catalyzing the isomerization of n&#8208;heptane. The Beta zeolite with no observable internal interfaces (see picture) can be 180&#8201;% higher in activity and 22&#8201;% higher in selectivity.







Abstract
Applications of zeolites in catalysis are plagued by strong diffusion resistance, which results from limitations to molecular transport in micropores, across external crystal surfaces, but also across internal interfaces. The first type of diffusion resistance is well understood, the second is receiving increasing attention, while the diffusion barriers at internal interfaces remain largely unclear. We take Pt/Beta catalyzed isomerization of n&#8208;heptane as the model system to explore the role of internal diffusion barriers in zeolite catalysis. The two as&#8208;synthesized Pt/Beta catalysts have an identical Pt loading, similar Beta particle size and acidity, but different internal structures. A Pt/Beta crystal with no observable internal interfaces can be 180&#8201;% higher in activity and 22&#8201;% higher in selectivity than its counterpart with numerous internal interfaces. This can only be attributed to the strong transport barriers across internal interfaces, as supported by directly comparing the apparent diffusivities of the two Beta samples.

      <title>Injury&#8208;Triggered Blueing Reactions of Psilocybe &#8220;Magic&#8221; Mushrooms</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic mushroom blues: Hallucinogenic Psilocybe mushrooms turn blue when injured. We report that the phosphatase PsiP and the laccase PsiL degrade psilocybin and initiate blueing. MALDI&#8208;MS and in situ NMR spectroscopy show that the blue color is due to a mixture of quinoid psilocyl oligomers, primarily coupled via carbon 5.







Abstract
Upon injury, psychotropic psilocybin&#8208;producing mushrooms instantly develop an intense blue color, the chemical basis and mode of formation of which has remained elusive. We report two enzymes from Psilocybe cubensis that carry out a two&#8208;step cascade to prepare psilocybin for oxidative oligomerization that leads to blue products. The phosphatase PsiP removes the 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphate group to yield psilocin, while PsiL oxidizes its 4&#8208;hydroxy group. The PsiL reaction was monitored by in&#8197;situ 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, which indicated that oxidative coupling of psilocyl residues occurs primarily via C&#8208;5. MS and IR spectroscopy indicated the formation of a heterogeneous mixture of preferentially psilocyl 3&#8208; to 13&#8208;mers and suggest multiple oligomerization routes, depending on oxidative power and substrate concentration. The results also imply that phosphate ester of psilocybin serves a reversible protective function.

Go for gold: The &#960; coordination of allyl moieties to (P,C) coordinated gold(III) has been authenticated and shown to promote nucleophilic addition. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses combined with detailed DFT calculations support tight quasi&#8208;symmetric &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the allyl moiety.







Abstract
Gold(III) &#960;&#8208;complexes have been authenticated recently with alkenes, alkynes, and arenes. The key importance of PdII &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes in organometallic chemistry (Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction) prompted us to explore gold(III) &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes, which have remained elusive so far. The (P,C)AuIII(allyl) and (methallyl) complexes 3 and 3&#8242; were readily prepared and isolated as thermally and air&#8208;stable solids. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses combined with detailed DFT calculations support tight quasi&#8208;symmetric &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the allyl moiety.

      <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Cymoside through a Bioinspired Oxidative Cyclization of a Strictosidine Derivative</title>
      <dc:description>
A bioinspired oxidative cascade cyclization enabled the first total synthesis of cymoside, a monoterpene indole alkaloid which possesses a unique furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoline&#8208;containing hexacyclic&#8208;fused skeleton.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the caged monoterpene indole alkaloid cymoside is reported. This natural product displays a unique hexacyclic&#8208;fused skeleton whose biosynthesis implies an early oxidative cyclization of strictosidine. Our approach to the furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoline framework relied on an unprecedented biomimetic sequence which started by the diastereoselective oxidation of the indole ring into a hydroxyindolenine which triggered the addition of an enol ether and was followed by the trapping of an oxocarbenium intermediate.

      <title>Dual Illumination Enhances Transformation of an Engineered Green&#8208;to&#8208;Red Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein</title>
      <dc:description>
Roadmap to red: LEA, an engineered ancestral GFP&#8208;like protein, could represent a key step for fluorescent proteins to become photoconvertible. Spectroscopic methods, aided by quantum calculations, were used to elucidate an intricate map of light&#8208;induced transformations with trapped species. A new dual&#8208;illumination strategy to enhance the green&#8208;to&#8208;red photoconversion was demonstrated.







Abstract
The molecular mechanisms for the photoconversion of fluorescent proteins remain elusive owing to the challenges of monitoring chromophore structural dynamics during the light&#8208;induced processes. We implemented time&#8208;resolved electronic and stimulated Raman spectroscopies to reveal two hidden species of an engineered ancestral GFP&#8208;like protein LEA, involving semi&#8208;trapped protonated and trapped deprotonated chromophores en&#8197;route to photoconversion in pH&#8197;7.9 buffer. A new dual&#8208;illumination approach was examined, using 400 and 505&#8197;nm light simultaneously to achieve faster conversion and higher color contrast. Substitution of UV irradiation with visible light benefits bioimaging, while the spectral benchmark of a trapped chromophore with characteristic ring twisting and bridge&#8208;H bending motions enables rational design of functional proteins. With the improved H&#8208;bonding network and structural motions, the photoexcited chromophore could increase the photoswitching&#8208;aided photoconversion while reducing trapped species.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Dual Illumination Enhances Transformation of an Engineered Green&#8208;to&#8208;Red Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roadmap to red&lt;/b&gt;: LEA, an engineered ancestral GFP&#8208;like protein, could represent a key step for fluorescent proteins to become photoconvertible. Spectroscopic methods, aided by quantum calculations, were used to elucidate an intricate map of light&#8208;induced transformations with trapped species. A new dual&#8208;illumination strategy to enhance the green&#8208;to&#8208;red photoconversion was demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms for the photoconversion of fluorescent proteins remain elusive owing to the challenges of monitoring chromophore structural dynamics during the light&#8208;induced processes. We implemented time&#8208;resolved electronic and stimulated Raman spectroscopies to reveal two hidden species of an engineered ancestral GFP&#8208;like protein LEA, involving semi&#8208;trapped protonated and trapped deprotonated chromophores en&#8197;route to photoconversion in pH&#8197;7.9 buffer. A new dual&#8208;illumination approach was examined, using 400 and 505&#8197;nm light simultaneously to achieve faster conversion and higher color contrast. Substitution of UV irradiation with visible light benefits bioimaging, while the spectral benchmark of a trapped chromophore with characteristic ring twisting and bridge&#8208;H bending motions enables rational design of functional proteins. With the improved H&#8208;bonding network and structural motions, the photoexcited chromophore could increase the photoswitching&#8208;aided photoconversion while reducing trapped species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steric Mixed&#8208;Cation 2D Perovskite as a Methylammonium Locker to Stabilize MAPbI3</title>
      <dc:description>
Locked up: The steric PTA&#8208;MA mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite of PTAMAPbI4 is demonstrated as an effective methylammonium (MA) cation locker to stabilize MAPbI3 by steric effect of the phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA) cation. This MA cation locked MAPbI3 based perovskite exhibited significantly enhanced stability and photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The reduced dimension perovskite including 2D perovskites are one of the most promising strategies to stabilize lead halide perovskite. A mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite based on a steric phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA) cation is presented. The PTA&#8208;MA mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite of PTAMAPbI4 can be formed on the surface of MAPbI3 (PTAI&#8208;MAPbI3) by controllable PTAI intercalation by either spin coating or soaking. The PTAMAPbI4 capping layer can not only passivate PTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 perovskite but also act as MA+ locker to inhibit MAI extraction and significantly enhance the stability. The highly stable PTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 based perovskite solar cells exhibit a reproducible photovoltaic performance with a champion PCE of 21.16&#8201;%. Such unencapsulated devices retain 93&#8201;% of initial efficiency after 500&#8197;h continuous illumination. This steric mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite as MA+ locker to stabilize the MAPbI3 is a promising strategy to design stable and high&#8208;performance hybrid lead halide perovskites.

Abstract
Metabolic fingerprints of biofluids encode diverse diseases and particularly urine detection offers complete non&#8208;invasiveness for diagnostics of the future. Present urine detection affords unsatisfactory performance and requires advanced materials to extract molecular information, due to the limited biomarkers and high sample complexity. Herein, we report plasmonic polymer@Ag for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) and sparse&#8208;learning&#8208;based metabolic diagnosis of kidney diseases. Using only 1&#8197;&#956;L of urine without enrichment or purification, polymer@Ag afforded urine metabolic fingerprints (UMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS in seconds. Analysis by sparse learning discriminated lupus nephritis from various other non&#8208;lupus nephropathies and controls. We combined UMFs with urine protein levels (UPLs) and constructed a new diagnostic model to characterize subtypes of kidney diseases. Our work guides urine&#8208;based diagnosis and leads to new personalized analytical tools for other diseases.

      <title>Fluorous Corannulenes: Ab initio Predictions and the Synthesis of sym&#8208;Pentafluorocorannulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Aromatic hydrocarbons and their fluorous counterparts provide a duality of structurally similar yet physically distinct compound classes. Efficient penta&#8208;substitution of pinacol borates by fluoride led to the first synthesis of pentafluorocorannulene.







Abstract
Ten sym&#8208;penta and deca&#8208;X substituted corannulenes (1&#8211;10; X=H, F, CH3, or CF3) define a library of fluorous compounds comprising high symmetry non&#8208;planar aromatic compunds. They provide a group of structurally similar, yet physically distinct structures manifesting special chemical behavior related to their degree of fluorination. Owing to their bowl forms, corannulene derivatives are distinct from planar polynuclear aromatic compounds; they have relatively high dipole moments, accept 1&#8211;4 electrons, and display room temperature fluorescence as well as low temp phosphorescence. Electronic structure theory predicts the bowl inversion barrier and physical properties. The syntheses of sym&#8208;pentafluorocorannulene by an efficient late stage fluorination affords a key derivative to calibrate predictions.

Abstract
Organic semiconducting single crystals are perfect for both fundamental and application&#8208;oriented research due to the advantages of free grain boundaries, few defects, and minimal traps and impurities, as well as their low&#8208;temperature processability, high flexibility, and low cost.

The progress made, including the molecular structures and fabrication technologies of organic single crystals, is introduced and organic single&#8208;crystal electronic devices, including field&#8208;effect transistors, phototransistors, p&#8208;n heterojunctions, and circuits, are summarized.

Abstract
Tropylium bromide undergoes noncatalyzed, regioselective additions to a large variety of Michael acceptors. In this way, acrylic esters are converted into &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cycloheptatrienylpropionic esters. The reactions are interpreted as nucleophilic attack of bromide ions at the electron&#8208;deficient olefins and the approach of the tropylium ion to the incipient carbanion. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the analogy to the amine&#8208; or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Rauhut&#8211;Currier reactions. Subsequent synthetic transformations of the bromo&#8208;cycloheptatrienylated adducts are reported.

Tropylium bromide undergoes noncatalyzed, regioselective additions to a large variety of Michael acceptors, converting acrylic esters into &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cycloheptatrienylpropionic esters. Quantum chemical calculations elucidated the analogy to the amine&#8208; or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman and Rauhut&#8211;Currier reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropylium bromide undergoes noncatalyzed, regioselective additions to a large variety of Michael acceptors. In this way, acrylic esters are converted into &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cycloheptatrienylpropionic esters. The reactions are interpreted as nucleophilic attack of bromide ions at the electron&#8208;deficient olefins and the approach of the tropylium ion to the incipient carbanion. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the analogy to the amine&#8208; or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Rauhut&#8211;Currier reactions. Subsequent synthetic transformations of the bromo&#8208;cycloheptatrienylated adducts are reported.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Construction of Chiral 2,3&#8208;Allenols through a Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Direct Alkynylogous Aldol Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Two by two: A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric direct alkynylogous aldol reaction was developed that delivers chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols with good to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.

Abstract
Chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols were constructed through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric direct alkynylogous aldol reaction. With aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes, the alkynylogous aldol reaction with (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS as the ligand proceeded smoothly to furnish the products in excellent regioselectivity with good to high diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. In the cases of aliphatic aldehydes, esters of but&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol as the substrates and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE as the ligand were found to be crucial to get good to high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The produced chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols are easily transformed into synthetically useful 2&#8208;furanones through cyclization. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied in the rapid synthesis of two chiral intermediates toward the synthesis of two pharmaceutically active compounds that have been proposed for the treatment of neurological disorders.

      <title>An Ultrasound Activated Vesicle of Janus Au&#8208;MnO Nanoparticles for Promoted Tumor Penetration and Sono&#8208;Chemodynamic Therapy of Orthotopic Liver Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
A smart self&#8208;assembled US/GSH dual&#8208;responsive nanovesicle was synthesized by self&#8208;assembly of Janus Au&#8208;MnO NP. It could be consecutively disassembled into the small Janus Au&#8208;MnO NPs and smaller Au NPs and Mn2+ for dual MRI/PAI&#8208;guided synergistic sono&#8208;chemodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has the advantages of high penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, and it is suitable for deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, there is still a lack of effective sonosensitizers with high sensitivity, safety, and penetration. Now, ultrasound (US) and glutathione (GSH) dual responsive vesicles of Janus Au&#8208;MnO nanoparticles (JNPs) were coated with PEG and a ROS&#8208;sensitive polymer. Upon US irradiation, the vesicles were disassembled into small Janus Au&#8208;MnO nanoparticles (NPs) with promoted penetration ability. Subsequently, GSH&#8208;triggered MnO degradation simultaneously released smaller Au NPs as numerous cavitation nucleation sites and Mn2+ for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), resulting in enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This also allowed dual&#8208;modality photoacoustic imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR) window and T1&#8208;MR imaging due to the released Mn2+, and inhibited orthotopic liver tumor growth via synergistic SDT/CDT.

      <title>A Triazole&#8208;Substituted Aryl Iodide with Omnipotent Reactivity in Enantioselective Oxidations
</title>
      <dc:description>
A good all&#8208;rounder: An easy to synthesize chiral triazole&#8208;substituted aryl iodide is described as an omnipotent catalyst for a variety of iodane&#8208;mediated enantioselective oxidations. It outperforms all existing chiral hypervalent iodine precursors.







Abstract
A widely applicable triazole&#8208;substituted chiral aryl iodide is described as catalyst for enantioselective oxidation reactions. The introduction of a substituent in ortho&#8208;position to the iodide is key for its high reactivity and selectivity. Besides a robust and modular synthesis, the main advantage of this catalyst is the excellent performance in a plethora of mechanistically diverse enantioselective transformations, such as spirocyclizations, phenol dearomatizations, &#945;&#8208;oxygenations, and oxidative rearrangements. DFT&#8208;calculations of in&#8197;situ generated [hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]arene isomers give an initial rational for the observed reactivity.

      <title>An Exceptionally Stable and Scalable Sugar&#8211;Polyolefin Frank&#8211;Kasper A15 Phase</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular truffles: A readily accessible one&#8208;component sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugate is presented that quantitatively produces an exceptionally stable thermotropic soft matter Frank&#8211;Kasper A15 phase through a rapid and irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transition.







Abstract
&#8220;One&#8208;component&#8221; soft material Frank&#8211;Kasper (FK) phases are an intriguing structural form of matter that possess periodically ordered structures arising from the self&#8208;reconfiguration and close packing of an initial assembly of identical &#8220;deformable&#8221; spheres into two or more size&#8208; or shape&#8208;distinct sets of particles. Significant challenges that must still be addressed to advance the field of soft matter FK phases further, however, include their rare and unpredictable occurrence, uncertain mechanisms of solid&#8208;state assembly, and low thermodynamic stability. Here we show that a readily&#8208;accessible sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugate quantitatively produces an exceptionally stable solid&#8208;state FK A15 phase through a rapid and irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transition, which contrary to other prevailing proposed mechanisms, does not require mass transfer between particles or large structural reorganization in the bulk to establish unit cell non&#8208;equivalency. Our results provide the basis for a realistic strategy for obtaining practical and scalable quantities of a diverse range of sugar&#8211;polyolefin FK A15 phases with unique intrinsic physical properties and chemical reactivities not previously seen in such systems.

      <title>Green Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Hydroacylation of Unactivated Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Photochemistry: A mild, metal&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute protocol for the direct photochemical hydroacylation of unactivated olefins was developed using phenylglyoxylic acid as the photoinitiator.







Abstract
Direct alkylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds to convert an aldehyde into a ketone is a notorious transformation, due to the laborious challenge of the formation of ketyl or acyl radicals. Herein, we report a green, cheap, metal&#8208;free and efficient method for the hydroacylation of olefins in water. This photochemical protocol utilizes phenylglyoxylic acid, a commercially available small organic molecule, as the photoinitiator, water as the solvent and household fluorescent lamps as the irradiation source, leading to a broad substrate scope of products in moderate to good yields. A wide range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, terminal and non&#8208;terminal alkenes and pharmaceutically relevant molecules can be employed, without the need of directing groups and additives or metal catalysts.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Modified Nucleic Acids: Metal&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs, Triples, and Tetrads</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;modified DNA: Topical research trends in this field at the border of bioinorganic chemistry and supramolecular coordination chemistry are identified and highlighted. The Minireview illustrates how ligand&#8208;based nucleoside surrogates have been used to introduce metal ions site&#8208;specifically into double&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;stranded DNA structures.







Abstract
The incorporation of metal ions into nucleic acids by means of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs represents a promising and prominent strategy for the site&#8208;specific decoration of these self&#8208;assembling supramolecules with metal&#8208;based functionality. Over the past 20&#8197;years, numerous nucleoside surrogates have been introduced in this respect, broadening the metal scope by providing perfectly tailored metal&#8208;binding sites. More recently, artificial nucleosides derived from natural purine or pyrimidine bases have moved into the focus of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairing, due to their expected compatibility with regular Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. This minireview summarizes these advances in metal&#8208;mediated base pairing but also includes further recent progress in the field. Moreover, it addresses other aspects of metal&#8208;modified nucleic acids, highlighting an expansion of the concept to metal&#8208;mediated base triples (in triple helices and three&#8208;way junctions) and metal&#8208;mediated base tetrads (in quadruplexes). For all types of metal&#8208;modified nucleic acids, proposed or accomplished applications are briefly mentioned, too.

      <title>The Cytotoxic Natural Product Vioprolide&#8197;A Targets Nucleolar Protein 14, Which Is Essential for Ribosome Biogenesis</title>
      <dc:description>
On target: Functional characterization of VioA revealed potent growth inhibitory effects in cancer cells and remarkable apoptosis induction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, without affecting healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thermal proteome profiling studies revealed nucleolar protein 14 (NOP14) as a protein target, which was further validated using proteomics and biological follow&#8208;up experiments.







Abstract
Novel targets are needed for treatment of devastating diseases such as cancer. For decades, natural products have guided innovative therapies by addressing diverse pathways. Inspired by the potent cytotoxic bioactivity of myxobacterial vioprolides&#8197;A&#8211;D, we performed in&#8208;depth studies on their mode of action. Based on its prominent potency against human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, we conducted thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and deciphered the target proteins of the most active derivative vioprolide&#8197;A (VioA) in Jurkat cells. Nucleolar protein 14 (NOP14), which is essential in ribosome biogenesis, was confirmed as a specific target of VioA by a suite of proteomic and biological follow&#8208;up experiments. Given its activity against ALL cells compared to healthy lymphocytes, VioA exhibits unique therapeutic potential for anticancer therapy through a novel mode of action.

      <title>A Flexible Method for Covalent Double Functionalization of Graphene Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Accessorizing: A versatile method for the chemoselective double functionalization of graphene oxide has been developed. The method involves epoxide ring opening by a protected aminoethanethiol, and subsequent reaction of the hydroxy groups with benzoquinone followed by Michael addition of an amine derivative.







Abstract
A method for the double functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) under mild alkaline conditions has been developed. Two functional groups were covalently linked to GO in two steps: the first group was attached by an epoxide ring&#8208;opening reaction and the second, bearing an amine function, was covalently conjugated to benzoquinone attached to the GO. The doubly functionalized GO was characterized by several techniques, confirming the sequential covalent modification of the GO surface with two different functional groups. This method is straightforward and the reaction conditions are mild, allowing preservation of the structure and properties of GO. This strategy could be exploited to prepare multifunctional GO conjugates with potential applications in many fields ranging from materials science to biomedicine.

      <title>Unconventional Route to Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enabled Highly Efficient Electron Extraction and Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The acid treatment of TiO2 weakens the bonding of octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, rendering the formation of amorphous TiO2 buffer layer on the surface of anatase TiO2. This amorphous TiO2 buffer layer contains rich oxygen vacancies, which increase the donor density of TiO2.







Abstract
The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes is an important endeavor toward achieving high&#8208;efficiency solar energy conversion. Now, a simple yet robust acid&#8208;treatment strategy is used to judiciously create an amorphous TiO2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO2 surface as an electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO2 surface. Such amorphous TiO2&#8208;coated ETL possesses an increased electron density owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. Compared to pristine TiO2&#8208;based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid&#8208;treated TiO2 ETL exhibit an enhanced short&#8208;circuit current and power conversion efficiency.

      <title>Gold and Carbene Relay Catalytic Enantioselective Cycloisomerization/Cyclization Reactions of Ynamides and Enals</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of a gold catalyst and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) in the same solution for relay reactions is disclosed. The ynamide substrate is activated by the gold catalyst to form an intermediate that subsequently reacts with the enals to form bicyclic &#948;&#8208;lactam products with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The combined use of gold as transition metal catalyst and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organic catalyst in the same solution for relay catalytic reactions was disclosed. The ynamide substrate was activated by gold catalyst to form unsaturated ketimine intermediate that subsequently reacted with the enals (via azolium enolate intermediate generated with NHC) effectively to form bicyclic lactam products with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivities. The gold and NHC coordination and dissociation can be dynamic and tunable events, and thus allow the co&#8208;existence of both active metal and carbene organic catalysts in appreciable concentrations, for the dual catalytic reaction to proceed.

      <title>An Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Exhibiting Electrical Conduction and Single&#8208;Ion Magnetism</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic personality: Electrocrystallisation of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and the magnetic precursor [Co(pdms)2] (H2pdms=1,2&#8208;bis(methanesulfonamido)benzene) afforded a 3D conducting single&#8208;ion magnet. Multiple charge&#8208;transfer interactions between the components produce partial oxidation states for TTF, the Co ion, and the pdms ligand, allowing electrical conductivity at low temperatures.







Abstract
The first three&#8208;dimensional (3D) conductive single&#8208;ion magnet (SIM), (TTF)2[Co(pdms)2] (TTF=tetrathiafulvalene and H2pdms=1,2&#8208;bis(methanesulfonamido)benzene), was electrochemically synthesised and investigated structurally, physically, and theoretically. The similar oxidation potentials of neutral TTF and the molecular precursor [HNEt3]2[M(pdms)2] (M=Co, Zn) allow for multiple charge transfers (CTs) between the SIM donor [M(pdms)2]n&#8722; and the TTF.+ acceptor, as well as an intradonor CT from the pdms ligand to Co ion upon electrocrystallisation. Usually TTF functions as a donor, whereas in our system TTF is both a donor and an accepter because of the similar oxidation potentials. Furthermore, the [M(pdms)2]n&#8722; donor and TTF.+ acceptor are not segregated but strongly interact with each other, contrary to reported layered donor&#8211;acceptor electrical conductors. The strong intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, combined with CT, allow for relatively high electrical conductivity even down to very low temperatures. Furthermore, SIM behaviour with slow magnetic relaxation and opening of hysteresis loops was observed. (TTF)2[Co(pdms)2] (2&#8208;Co) is an excellent building block for preparing new conductive SIMs.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Templated, Tight Loop Conformation of a Cys&#8208;X&#8208;Cys Biomimetic Assembles a Dimanganese Complex</title>

(Graphic includes &#8220;Two Fishes, One Hook&#8221;; Paul Klee, 1901.)







Abstract
With the goal of generating anionic analogues to MN2S2&#8901;Mn(CO)3Br we introduced metallodithiolate ligands, MN2S22&#8722; prepared from the Cys&#8208;X&#8208;Cys biomimetic, ema4&#8722; ligand (ema=N,N&#8242;&#8208;ethylenebis(mercaptoacetamide); M=NiII, [VIV&#8801;O]2+ and FeIII) to Mn(CO)5Br. An unexpected, remarkably stable dimanganese product, (H2N2(CH2C=O(&#956;&#8208;S))2)[Mn(CO)3]2 resulted from loss of M originally residing in the N2S24&#8722; pocket, replaced by protonation at the amido nitrogens, generating H2ema2&#8722;. Accordingly, the ema ligand has switched its coordination mode from an N2S24&#8722; cavity holding a single metal, to a binucleating H2ema2&#8722; with bridging sulfurs and carboxamide oxygens within Mn&#8208;&#956;&#8208;S&#8208;CH2&#8208;C&#8208;O, 5&#8208;membered rings. In situ metal&#8208;templating by zinc ions gives quantitative yields of the Mn2 product. By computational studies we compared the conformations of &#8220;linear&#8221; ema4&#8722; to ema4&#8722; frozen in the &#8220;tight&#8208;loop&#8221; around single metals, and to the &#8220;looser&#8221; fold possible for H2ema2&#8722; that is the optimal arrangement for binucleation. XRD molecular structures show extensive H&#8208;bonding at the amido&#8208;nitrogen protons in the solid state.

      <title>Dimethyl Dihydroacridines as Photocatalysts in Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization of Acrylate Monomers</title>
      <dc:description>
Polymers in flow: Organic photoredox catalysis is applied to the controlled synthesis of poly(acrylates). This advancement is enabled by the development of new organic photoredox catalysts, dimethyl dihydroacridines, with unique properties. The use of continuous flow reactors is also key to the success of the method.







Abstract
Development of photocatalysts (PCs) with diverse properties has been essential in the advancement of organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP). Dimethyl dihydroacridines are presented here as a new family of organic PCs, for the first time enabling controlled polymerization of challenging acrylate monomers by O&#8208;ATRP. Structure&#8211;property relationships for seven PCs are established, demonstrating tunable photochemical and electrochemical properties, and accessing a strongly oxidizing 2PC.+ intermediate for efficient deactivation. In O&#8208;ATRP, the combination of PC, implementation of continuous&#8208;flow reactors, and promotion of deactivation through addition of LiBr are critical to producing well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers with dispersities as low as 1.12. The utility of this approach is established through demonstration of the oxygen&#8208;tolerance of the system and application to diverse acrylate monomers, including the synthesis of well&#8208;defined di&#8208; and triblock copolymers.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Dimethyl Dihydroacridines as Photocatalysts in Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization of Acrylate Monomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polymers in flow&lt;/b&gt;: Organic photoredox catalysis is applied to the controlled synthesis of poly(acrylates). This advancement is enabled by the development of new organic photoredox catalysts, dimethyl dihydroacridines, with unique properties. The use of continuous flow reactors is also key to the success of the method.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of photocatalysts (PCs) with diverse properties has been essential in the advancement of organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP). Dimethyl dihydroacridines are presented here as a new family of organic PCs, for the first time enabling controlled polymerization of challenging acrylate monomers by O&#8208;ATRP. Structure&#8211;property relationships for seven PCs are established, demonstrating tunable photochemical and electrochemical properties, and accessing a strongly oxidizing &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;PC&lt;sup&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate for efficient deactivation. In O&#8208;ATRP, the combination of PC, implementation of continuous&#8208;flow reactors, and promotion of deactivation through addition of LiBr are critical to producing well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers with dispersities as low as 1.12. The utility of this approach is established through demonstration of the oxygen&#8208;tolerance of the system and application to diverse acrylate monomers, including the synthesis of well&#8208;defined di&#8208; and triblock copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The first example of PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of aliphatic and benzoheteroaryl aldehydes has been developed using a transient ligand and an external ligand, concurrently. A wide array of &#947;&#8208;arylated aldehydes were readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups. The catalytic mechanism was studied by performing deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments, which indicated that the &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the reaction process. This reaction could be performed on a gram scale, and also demonstrated its potential application in the synthesis of new mechanofluorochromic materials with blue&#8208;shifted mechanochromic properties.

      <title>Towards Long&#8208;Term Photostability of Novel Nickel Hydroxide/BiVO4 Photoanodes via in&#8208;situ Catalyst Tuning</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing long&#8208;term photostability of BiVO  4  photoanode is an important issue for solar water splitting, NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) has a fast water oxidation kinetics compared to FeOOH OEC.&#160; However, it generally shows a relatively lower photoresponse and poor stability compared to FeOOH due to the more substantial interface recombination at the NiOOH/ BiVO  4  junction. In this work, we utilize a feasible plasma etching approach to reduce both interface/surface recombination at NiOOH/ BiVO  4  and NiOOH/electrolyte junctions. Further, adding Fe  2+  into the borate buffer electrolyte alleviates the active but unstable character of etched&#8208;NiOOH/BiVO  4  , leading to an outstanding oxygen evolution over 200 h. The improved charge transfer and photostability can be attributed to the active defects and a mixture of NiOOH/NiO/Ni in OEC induced by plasma etching treatment. Metallic Ni acts as the ion source for the in&#8208;situ generation of the NiFe OEC over long&#8208;term durability.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Anisotropic ZnSe Nanorods with Zinc&#8208;Blende Crystal Structure</title>
      <dc:description>Compared with the well explored cadmium based one&#8208;dimensional nanorods (NRs), it is still a big challenge to produce heavy&#8208;metal free II&#8208;VI semiconductor analogues with a controlled size, shape and crystal structure. Herein, we report a synthetic strategy towards ZnSe NRs with a zinc&#8208;blende crystal structure, where use of the anisotropic nuclei produced via a high temperature selenium injection favors anisotropic growth. Elongated ZnSe NRs were produced from anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, while spherical ZnSe nanocrystals were obtained starting from isotropic nuclei. The different free energy at (111) and (220) planes in anisotropic ZnSe nuclei induces the anisotropic growth for ZnSe NRs along &lt;111&gt; direction. Proper choice of the capping ligand (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) has an important implication for the formation of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, and has also allowed us to control the diameter of the final ZnSe NRs via limiting the growth of the (220) crystal plane of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei.</dc:description>

Interestingly, when the size of the guest luminophores was close to the cubic size, it showed determined and strong negative CPL. Otherwise, either positive or negative CPL was induced.

      <title>C&#8208;C bond formation in syngas conversion over Zn sites grafted on ZSM&#8208;5</title>
      <dc:description>Despite significant progress achieved in Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) technology, the selectivity control remains a challenge in syngas conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that zinc ion&#8208;exchanged ZSM&#8208;5 steers syngas conversion toward ethane with a selectivity in hydrocarbons (excluding CO  2  ) reaching as high as 87% at 20% CO conversion. NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray fluorescence indicate that the selective pathway toward ethane is likely attributed to the Zn sites grafted within the ZSM&#8208;5 pores.  Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ  solid state NMR detects C  2  species of acetyl [&#8208;COCH  3  ] bonding with an oxygen, ethyl [&#8208;CH  2  CH  3  ] bonding with a Zn site, and epoxyethane molecules adsorbing on a Zn site and a Br&#248;nsted acid site of the catalyst, respectively. These could provide some insights to C&#8208;C bond formation during ethane formation. Interestingly, this selective reaction pathway toward ethane appears to be general, because a series of other Zn  2+  ion&#8208;exchanged aluminosilicate zeolites with different topologies e.g. SSZ&#8208;13, MCM&#8208;22, ZSM&#8208;12 all give predominantly ethane. By contrast, a physical mixture of ZnO&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 favors formation of hydrocarbons beyond C  3+  . These results provide an important guidance for tuning the product selectivity in syngas conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmable Assembly of Nano&#8208;architectures through Designing Anisotropic DNA Origami Patches</title>
      <dc:description>Programmable assembly of nanoparticles towards well&#8208;defined architectures has attracted much attention due to their tailored properties resulted from coupling effects. However, ways to develop general and precise approaches to control the binding modes between nanoparticles (NPs) when fabricating designed architectures remain a significant challenge due to the difficulty in manipulating the accurate positions of the functional patches on the surface of NPs. Here, we develop a strategy to encage spherical NPs into pre&#8208;designed octahedral DNA origami frames (DOFs) through DNA base&#8208;pairings. The DOFs logically define the arrangements of functional patches in three dimensions, due to the programmability of DNA hybridization, and thus control the binding modes of the &#8220;caged&#8221; nanoparticle with designed anisotropy. By applying the node&#8208;and&#8208;spacer approach, which was widely used in crystal engineering to design coordination polymers, we are able to rationally design patchy NPs with lower symmetry encoded to assemble a series of nano&#8208;architectures with high&#8208;order geometries.</dc:description>

      <title>Controllable Synthesis of Graphdiyne Nanoribbons</title>

      <title>p&#8208; and m&#8208;Phenylene Bridged Carbon Centred Diradicals with CAAC&#8208;Scaffolds: Analogues of Thiele and Schlenk Hydrocarbons</title>

Despite the progress made with nanozymes, the efficient antioxidant therapy that could fast eliminate all of these RONS remains challenging, owing largely to the specificity and low activity of exploited nanozymes.

      <title>Soft Lattice and Defect Covalency Rationalize Tolerance of &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells to Native Defects</title>
      <dc:description>Although all&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have shown tremendous improvement over the past few years, they are still inferior to the hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites in the solar power conversion efficiency. Recently, a conceptually new &#946;&#8208;CsPbI  3  perovskite has demonstrated an impressive 18.4% efficiency combined with good thermodynamic stability at ambient conditions. We use  ab initio  non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics to show that native point defects in &#946;&#8208;CsPbI  3  are generally benign for non&#8208;radiative charge recombination, regardless of whether they introduce shallow or deep trap states. Moreover, formation of new covalently bound species in the presence of defects slows down the recombination. These results indicate that halide perovskites do not follow the simple models used to explain defect&#8208;mediated charge recombination in the conventional semiconductors. The strong tolerance of electron&#8208;hole recombination against defects arises due to the softness of the perovskite lattice, which permits separation of electrons and holes upon defect formation, and allows only low&#8208;frequency vibrations to couple to the electronic subsystem. Both factors decrease significantly the non&#8208;adiabatic coupling and slow down the dissipation of electronic energy to heat. We suggest that a halide&#8208;rich synthesis environment may further improve the efficiency, and propose that strong defect tolerance is general to metal halide perovskites because they exhibit much lower bulk moduli compared to the conventional semiconductors used in photovoltaic, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, lasing, light&#8208;emitting, detecting and other opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Photo&#8208;responsive propeller&#8208;like chiral AIE Cu(I) clusters</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear Cu(I) clusters with unique photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement property were prepared (designated as  R/S&#8208;Cu3  ).  R/S&#8208;Cu3  showed no luminescence in DMSO before UV light irradiation but intense variable luminescence after UV light irradiation, which was proven to be attributed to the stepwise oxidation of ligand in the clusters. Meanwhile,  R/S&#8208;Cu3  exhibited typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature (  &#945;  AIE  = 17.3). Mechanism studies showed that metal cluster&#8208;centered (MCC) and triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (  3  MLCT) processes are the origination of their luminescence, which are regulated by a restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM) mechanism in different state.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, a pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear Cu(I) clusters with unique photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement property were prepared (designated as  R/S&#8208;Cu3  ).  R/S&#8208;Cu3  showed no luminescence in DMSO before UV light irradiation but intense variable luminescence after UV light irradiation, which was proven to be attributed to the stepwise oxidation of ligand in the clusters. Meanwhile,  R/S&#8208;Cu3  exhibited typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature (  &#945;  AIE  = 17.3). Mechanism studies showed that metal cluster&#8208;centered (MCC) and triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (  3  MLCT) processes are the origination of their luminescence, which are regulated by a restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM) mechanism in different state. The chiral structure and AIE feature endow  R/S&#8208;Cu3  with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence (  g  lum  = 2&#215;10  &#8208;2  ) in aggregated state. Moreover,  R/S&#8208;Cu3  shows good capability for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which make it can be used as promising photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). This work enriches limited kinds of atomically precise AIE clusters, gains insight into their luminescence mechanism, and offers the prospect of application in multifunctional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 2&#8208;Amidoacrylates</title>
      <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant nickel, coordinated with a suitable bisphosphine ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;amidoacrylates, affording the chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee).

The hydrogenated products could be simply converted to chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, and their bioactive derivatives. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was investigated using deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and computational calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Integrating Allyl Electrophiles into Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Conjunctive Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Allylation and conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling represent two useful, yet largely distinct, reactivity paradigms in catalysis.

Herein, we report the use of allyl electrophiles in nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling with a non&#8208;conjugated alkene and dimethylzinc.

High chemoselectivity through substrate directivity is demonstrated in the facile reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;&#947; alkene of the starting material, while the &#949;&#8208;&#950; alkene of the product is preserved.

      <title>Tunable Surface Wrinkling via Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyamine&#8208;Anion Coacervation Process Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>We demonstrate a bio&#8208;inspired method to render controlled wrinkling surface patterns on supramolecular architectures assembled from polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. It involves polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction generating positively charged coacervates, which while dictating the assembly of POM into spherical structures, further facilitate an interesting surface morphogenesis with wrinkling patterns. This spontaneous surface wrinkling depends on the type of multivalent anion and the pH. Particularly, as the polyamine&#8208;anion interaction becomes stronger, the wrinkles turn denser with lesser depth, which eventually undergoes post&#8208;buckling to engender a complex surface pattern. Interestingly, the order of influence exerted by different anions on the morphology follows the Hofmeister series clearly reflecting the versatiltiy of the method. Further, the mild synthesis conditions keep the the functional POM units dipersed in the sphere with a structural transformability to their lacunary form. Therefore, the presented method is believed to aid in creating exotic surface patterns from various functional units for advanced applications.</dc:description>

Further, the mild synthesis conditions keep the the functional POM units dipersed in the sphere with a structural transformability to their lacunary form. Therefore, the presented method is believed to aid in creating exotic surface patterns from various functional units for advanced applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Photoenzymatic Cascades to Synthesize Long Chain Aliphatic Amines and Esters from Renewable Fatty Acids</title>
      <dc:description>Long chain aliphatic amines such as ( S,Z  )&#8208;heptadec&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;amine and 9&#8208;aminoheptadecane were synthesized from ricinoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively, by whole&#8208;cell cascade reactions using the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Micrococcus luteus  , an engineered amine transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis  (Vf&#8208;ATA), and a photoactivated decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis  NC64A (Cv&#8208;FAP) in a one&#8208;pot process. In addition, long chain aliphatic esters such as 10&#8208;(heptanoyloxy)dec&#8208;8&#8208;ene and octylnonanoate were prepared from ricinoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively, by using the combination of the ADH, a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase variant from Pseudomonas putida  KT2440, and the Cv&#8208;FAP. The target compounds were produced at rates of up to 37 U/g dry cells with conversions up to 90%. Therefore, this study contributes to the preparation of industrially relevant long chain aliphatic chiral amines and esters from renewable fatty acid resources.</dc:description>

      <title>Cation Diffusion Guides Hybrid Halide Perovskite Crystallization during Gel Stage</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention to find their promising potential in various applications as optoelectronics. Unfortunately, this materials with mixed cations/anions often suffer from phase segregation, which is detrimental to the device efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. During perovskite film growth, the gel stage (in between liquid and crystalline) correlates to the phase segregation, which has been rarely explored. Herein, we systematically investigate the cation diffusion kinetics at the gel stage to develop a diffusion model obeying Fick&#8217;s Second Law. Take 2D layered perovskite as an example, we combine theoretical and experimental results to reveal the impacts of diffusion coefficient, temperature, and gel duration on the film growth and phase formation. In light of this finding, we successfully fabricate a homogenous 2D perovskite thin film without significant phase segregation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of gel stage and relevant cation diffusion kinetics would further guide the design and processing of halide perovskites with mixed composition to meet requirements for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Anchored mediator enabling shuttle&#8211;free redox mediation in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Redox mediators (RMs) are considered an effective countermeasure to reduce the large polarization in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient enhancement of the cyclability is limited by the trade&#8211;offs of freely mobile RMs, which are beneficial for charge transport but also trigger the shuttling phenomenon. Here, we successfully decoupled the charge&#8211;carrying redox property of RMs and shuttling phenomenon by anchoring the RMs in polymer form, where physical RM migration was replaced by charge transfer along polymer chains. Using a model system of a polymer, PTMA (2,2,6,6&#8211;tetramethyl&#8211;1&#8211;piperidinyloxy&#8211;4&#8211;yl methacrylate), based on the well&#8211;known RM tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), it is demonstrated that PTMA is capable of functioning as a stationary RM, preserving the redox activity of TEMPO. The efficiency of RM&#8211;mediated Li  2  O  2  decomposition remains remarkably stable without the consumption of oxidized RMs or degradation of the lithium anode, resulting in marked improvement of the performance of the lithium&#8211;oxygen cell.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation of Pertussis&#8208;Like Pentasaccharide Bearing Multiple Rare Sugars as a Potential Anti&#8208;pertussis Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>The 60&#8208;year high  Bordetella pertussis  (  B. pertussis  ) infection rate in the world suggests the urgent need for new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccines. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of  B. pertussis  is an attractive antigen for vaccine development. With the presence of multiple rare sugars and unusual glycosyl linkages,  B. pertussis  LPS is a highly challenging synthetic target. In this work, aided by molecular dynamics simulation and modeling, the pertussis LPS like pentasaccharide was chemically synthesized for the first time. The pentasaccharide was conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946; as a vaccine candidate. Immunization of mice with the conjugate induced robust anti&#8208;glycan IgG responses with IgG titers reaching several million enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units.

      <title>Tuning Cellular Biological Functions Through the Controlled Release of NO from a Porous Ti&#8208;MOF</title>
      <dc:description>Materials for the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO) are of interest for therapeutic applications. However, to date, many suffer from toxicity and stability issues, as well as poor performance. Herein, we propose a new NO adsorption/release mechanism through the formation of nitrites on the skeleton of a titanium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) that we have named MIP&#8208;177, featuring a suitable set of properties for such applications: (i) high NO storage capacity (3 &#181;mol mg  &#8208;1  solid  ), (ii) excellent biocompatibility at therapeutic relevant concentrations (no cytotoxicity at 90 &#181;g/mL for wound healing) due to its high stability in biological media (&lt; 9% degradation in 72 hours) and (iii) slow NO release in biological media (&#8275;2 hours for 90% release). The prospective application of MIP&#8208;177 is demonstrated through the NO&#8208;driven control of mitochondrial respiration in cells and the stimulation of cell migration, paving the way for the design of new NO delivery systems for wound healing therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;fouling Fluoropolymers for Bioconjugation and In Vivo Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>The conjugation of hydrophilic low&#8208;fouling polymers to therapeutic molecules and particles is an effective approach to improving their aqueous stability and solubility, and extending their pharmacokinetics. Recent concerns over the immunogenicity of poly(ethylene glycol) has highlighted the importance of identifying alternative low fouling polymers. Herein, we report a new class of synthetic water&#8208;soluble homo&#8208;fluoropolymers with a sulfoxide side&#8208;chain structure. The incorporation of fluorine enables direct imaging of the homopolymer by  19  F MRI, negating the need for additional synthetic steps to attach an imaging moiety. These self&#8208;reporting fluoropolymers show outstanding imaging sensitivity and as such represent a new class of low&#8208;fouling polymer for bioconjugation and  in vivo  tracking.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Copper&#8208;Substituted CoS2@CuxS Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes by Sequential Ion Exchange for Efficient Sodium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Storage boxes: Copper&#8208;substituted CoS2@CuxS double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes were synthesized through a multistep metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based templating strategy (see picture). With their unique shell architecture and complex composition, these double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes exhibited enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, superior rate capability, and long cycle life.







Abstract
The construction of hybrid architectures for electrode materials has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to boost sodium&#8208;storage properties because of the synergetic effect of each component. However, the fabrication of hybrid nanostructures with a rational structure and desired composition for effective sodium storage is still challenging. In this study, an integrated nanostructure composed of copper&#8208;substituted CoS2@CuxS double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (denoted as Cu&#8208;CoS2@CuxS DSNBs) was synthesized through a rational metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based templating strategy. The unique shell configuration and complex composition endow the Cu&#8208;CoS2@CuxS DSNBs with enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of superior rate capability and stable cyclability.

      <title>A Multi&#8208;Wall Sn/SnO2@Carbon Hollow Nanofiber Anode Material for High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@carbon composite hollow nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning and carbonization reduction. They have solid wire core that is wrapped by a double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube. This wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube strategy perfectly combines high energy density and high cycling stability. It produces superior electrochemical performance, with a capacity of 986.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 508.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@carbon hollow nanofibers evolved from SnO2 nanofibers are designed and programable synthesized by electrospinning, polypyrrole coating, and annealing reduction. The synthesized hollow nanofibers have a special wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube structure with larger specific surface area and abundant inner spaces, which can provide effective contacting area of electrolyte with electrode materials and more active sites for redox reaction. It shows excellent cycling stability by virtue of effectively alleviating pulverization of tin&#8208;based electrode materials caused by volume expansion. Even after 2000 cycles, the wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube Sn/SnO2@carbon nanofibers exhibit a high specific capacity of 986.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and still maintains 508.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This outstanding electrochemical performance suggests the multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@ carbon hollow nanofibers are great promising for high performance energy storage systems.

      <title>Multivariate Modulation of the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 for Defect&#8208;Controlled Multimodal Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as leading candidates for nanoscale drug delivery, as a consequence of their high drug capacities, ease of functionality, and the ability to carefully engineer key physical properties. Despite many anticancer treatment regimens consisting of a cocktail of different drugs, examples of delivery of multiple drugs from one MOF are rare, potentially hampered by difficulties in postsynthetic loading of more than one cargo molecule. Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination at the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as leading candidates for nanoscale drug delivery, as a consequence of their high drug capacities, ease of functionality, and the ability to carefully engineer key physical properties. Despite many anticancer treatment regimens consisting of a cocktail of different drugs, examples of delivery of multiple drugs from one MOF are rare, potentially hampered by difficulties in postsynthetic loading of more than one cargo molecule. Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination at the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Polyhydrazide&#8208;based organic nanotubes as extremely efficient and highly selective artificial iodide channels</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a series of pore&#8208;containing polymeric nanotubes based on an H&#8208;bonded hydrazide backbone. Nanotubes of suitable lengths, possessing a hollow cavity of ~ 6.5 &#197; in diameter, are interestingly found to mediate highly efficient transport of diverse types of anions, rather than cations, across lipid membrane.

Notably, even in cholesterol&#8208;rich environment, iodide transport activity still remains high with  EC  50  of 0.37 uM.

      <title>The crucial role of charge accumulation and spin polarization in activating carbon&#8208;based catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective carbon&#8208;based catalysts are promising for catalyzing electrochemical N  2  reduction reaction (NRR). However, the activity origin of carbon&#8208;based catalysts towards NRR remains unclear, and regularities and rules in rational design carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts are still lacking.

      <title>Oppositely Charged Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes with 2D Nanofluidic Channels for Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis (RED) is considered as the most promising technique to harvest osmotic energy. However, the traditional membranes are limited by the high internal resistance and low efficiency, resulting in undesirable power densities. Here, we report the combination of oppositely charged Ti  3  C  2  T  x  MXene membranes (MXMs) with confined 2D nanofluidic channels as high&#8208;performance osmotic power generators. The negatively or positively charged 2D MXene nanochannels exhibit typical surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport and show excellent cation or anion selectivity. By mixing the artificial sea water (0.5 M NaCl) and river water (0.01 M NaCl), we obtain a maximum power density of ~4.6 W m  &#8722;2  , higher than most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generators, and very close to the commercialization benchmark (5 W m  &#8722;2  ). Through connecting ten tandem MXM&#8208;RED stacks, the output voltage can reach up 1.66 V, which can directly power the electronic devices. This work signi&#64257;cantly expands possibilities for the application of MXMs in osmotic power generation, making this blue energy a tangible and promising alternative.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals &#8211; a Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8208;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>For in&#8208;situ resource utilization (ISRU), the cost&#8208;mass conundrum needs to be solved, before any other formidable challenges may be tackled. Technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals, rather than taking the most advanced technology of today. Using this approach, this paper seeks to provide a think tank about how chemical process intensification can help with technology and business case disruption of ISRU matters, how this might influence Space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and first of all even Earth&#8208;industry transformations. The disruptive technology considered is continuous micro&#8208;flow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids (instead of conventional organic solvents). The Space business considered is Asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction of the amount of process water used in the Asteroid mining process. This paper suggests a pathway toward water savings by orders of magnitude, up to the technological limit of best Earth&#8208;process intensification and their physical limits (e.g. of solubility). This is believed to provide a solution to a major economic bottleneck, whilst leaving many technology developments to be achieved before a holistic system and business picture can be given.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing long&#8208;range anisotropic interactions &#8211; A general and sign&#8208;sensitive strategy to measure 1H&#8208;1H residual dipolar couplings as a key advance for organic structure determination</title>
      <dc:description>Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are amongst the most powerful NMR parameters for organic structure elucidation. In order to maximize their effectiveness in increasingly complex cases such as flexible compounds, a maximum of RDCs between nuclei sampling a large distribution of orientations is needed, including sign information. For this, the easily accessible one&#8208;bond  1  H&#8208;  13  C RDCs alone often fall short. Long&#8208;range  1  H&#8208;  1  H RDCs are both abundant and typically sample highly complementary orientations, but accessing them in a sign&#8208;sensitive way has been severely obstructed due to the overflow of  1  H&#8208;  1  H couplings. Here, we present a generally applicable strategy that allows the measurement of a large number of  1  H&#8208;  1  H RDCs, including the sign, that is based on a combination of an improved PSYCHEDELIC method and a new selective constant&#8208;time &#946;&#8208;COSY experiment.

      <title>Coenzymes and their role in the evolution of Life</title>
      <dc:description>The evolution of coenzymes, or the impact of coenzymes on the origin of Life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence and yet, this topic is rarely discussed in contemporary science. Coenzymes are small molecules that occupy an elementary role with respect to chemical reactivity and selectivity when associated with a macromolecular template. They are essential for functional biocatalysis in all living organisms and act as currency to regulate many basic metabolic processes. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have co&#8208;existed with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. Through this discussion, we hope to renew interest for understanding more about the origins of coenzymes, particularly those with a heterocyclic core, and their role as promoters and mediators in biocatalysis. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of Life.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrochlorination and Hydrobromination of Alkynes by Shuttle Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Corrosion free: Two methods for the synthesis of vinyl halides by iridium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrohalogenation of unactivated alkynes are described. The use of 4&#8208;chlorobutan&#8208;2&#8208;one or tert&#8208;butyl halide as donors of hydrogen halides allows this transformation in the absence of corrosive reagents. This method leads to alkenyl halide compounds containing acid&#8208;sensitive groups, such as tertiary alcohols, silyl ethers, and acetals.







Abstract
Described herein are two different methods for the synthesis of vinyl halides by a shuttle catalysis based iridium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrohalogenation of unactivated alkynes. The use of 4&#8208;chlorobutan&#8208;2&#8208;one or tert&#8208;butyl halide as donors of hydrogen halides allows this transformation in the absence of corrosive reagents, such as hydrogen halides or acid chlorides, thus largely improving the functional&#8208;group tolerance and safety profile of these reactions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. This method has granted access to alkenyl halide compounds containing acid&#8208;sensitive groups, such as tertiary alcohols, silyl ethers, and acetals. The synthetic value of those methodologies has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis where low catalyst loading was achieved.

Abstract
Nickela&#8208;electrooxidative C&#8722;H alkoxylations with challenging secondary alcohols were accomplished in a fully dehydrogenative fashion, thereby avoiding stoichiometric chemical oxidants, with H2 as the only stoichiometric byproduct. The nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed oxygenation proved viable with various (hetero)arenes, including naturally occurring secondary alcohols, without racemization. Detailed mechanistic investigation, including DFT calculations and cyclovoltammetric studies of a well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activated nickel(III) intermediate, suggest an oxidation&#8208;induced reductive elimination at nickel(III).

      <title>An Inorganic Biopolymer Polyphosphate Controls Positively Charged Protein Phase Transitions</title>
      <dc:description>
Crowdsurfing: An inorganic polyphosphate polymer, polyP, can interact with positively charged green fluorescent protein, +36GFP, in cells resulting in liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) by intermolecular electrostatic interactions. These coacervates can coalesce, demonstrating their liquid&#8208;like properties. This may offer a general approach to manipulate protein&#8211;protein interactions through LLPS.







Abstract
Polyphosphate (PolyP) is one of the most compact inorganic polyanionic biopolymers that participates in various physiological processes. However, the mechanism of the interaction between polyP and proteins remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that polyP can interact with positively charged green fluorescent protein, +36GFP, resulting in liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) by intermolecular electrostatic interactions in cells. Upon nutrient deprivation, genetically engineered Citrobacter freundii accumulates intracellular polyP at a rate of 210&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1, resulting in the compartmentation of +36GFP at the cell poles within 1&#8197;h. Medium chain&#8208;length polyP (60&#8208;mer) could induce the formation of +36GFP coacervates in&#8197;vitro at a protein concentration as low as 200&#8197;nm, which is of the same magnitude as native proteins. In contrast, shorter polyP (14&#8208;mer) could not induce LLPS under the same conditions. This may offer a general approach to manipulate protein&#8211;protein interactions through LLPS.

These coacervates can coalesce, demonstrating their liquid&#8208;like properties. This may offer a general approach to manipulate protein&#8211;protein interactions through LLPS.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphate (PolyP) is one of the most compact inorganic polyanionic biopolymers that participates in various physiological processes. However, the mechanism of the interaction between polyP and proteins remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that polyP can interact with positively charged green fluorescent protein, +36GFP, resulting in liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) by intermolecular electrostatic interactions in cells. Upon nutrient deprivation, genetically engineered Citrobacter freundii accumulates intracellular polyP at a rate of 210&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in the compartmentation of +36GFP at the cell poles within 1&#8197;h. Medium chain&#8208;length polyP (60&#8208;mer) could induce the formation of +36GFP coacervates in&#8197;vitro at a protein concentration as low as 200&#8197;n&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, which is of the same magnitude as native proteins. In contrast, shorter polyP (14&#8208;mer) could not induce LLPS under the same conditions. This may offer a general approach to manipulate protein&#8211;protein interactions through LLPS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On&#8208;surface Synthesis of a Semiconducting 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cu3(C6O6) Exhibiting Dispersive Electronic Bands</title>
      <dc:description>
Flatland mobility: A single&#8208;layer 2D metal&#8211;organic framework features a direct band gap of 1.5&#8197;eV and a highly dispersive conduction band. It has an effective mass of 0.45&#8197;me and provides outstanding charge mobility.







Abstract
A 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;MOF) was formed on a Cu(111) substrate using benzenehexol molecules. By means of a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory, the structure of the 2D&#8208;MOF is determined to be Cu3(C6O6), which is stabilized by O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bonding motifs. We find that upon adsorption on Cu(111), the 2D&#8208;MOF features a semiconductor band structure with a direct band gap of 1.5&#8197;eV. The O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bonds offer efficient charge delocalization, which gives rise to a highly dispersive conduction band with an effective mass of 0.45&#8197;me at the band bottom, implying a high electron mobility in this material.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Independent Conductance of Thiophene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Stacking Junctions</title>
      <dc:description>
Which mode of transport? The conductance of thiophene&#8208;based single&#8208;stacking junctions was found to be nearly independent of the conjugation pattern of the molecular structure. When the length of the conjugated region increased, there was a change in the dominant charge&#8208;transport path from intramolecular to intermolecular (see picture).







Abstract
The experimental investigation of intermolecular charge transport in &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials is challenging. Herein, we describe the investigation of charge transport through intermolecular and intramolecular paths in single&#8208;molecule and single&#8208;stacking thiophene junctions by the mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique. We found that the ability for intermolecular charge transport through different single&#8208;stacking junctions was approximately independent of the molecular structure, which contrasts with the strong length dependence of conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions with the same building blocks, and the dominant charge&#8208;transport path of molecules with two anchors transited from an intramolecular to an intermolecular path when the degree of conjugation increased. An increase in conjugation further led to higher binding probability owing to the variation in binding energies, as supported by DFT calculations.

      <title>Intramolecular Borylation via Sequential B&#8722;Mes Bond Cleavage for the Divergent Synthesis of B,N,B&#8208;Doped Benzo[4]helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>
A new and divergent intramolecular borylation method has been found to be highly effective for the synthesis of a variety of symmetrically and unsymmetrically functionalized B,N,B&#8208;[4]helicenes with potential applications as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). EDG/EWG=electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing group, Mes=Mesityl.







Abstract
New symmetric and unsymmetric B,N,B&#8208;doped benzo[4]helicenes 3&#8211;6&#8201;a/b have been achieved in good yields, using a three&#8208;step process, starting from N(tolyl)3 in a highly divergent manner (7 examples). A borinic acid functionalized 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;anthracene 1 was found to display unprecedented reactivity, acting as a convenient and highly effective precursor for selective formation of bromo&#8208;substituted B,N,B&#8208;benzo[4]helicenes 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b via intramolecular borylation and sequential B&#8722;Mes bond cleavage in the presence of BBr3. Subsequent reaction of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with Ar&#8208;Li provided a highly effective toolbox for the preparation of symmetrically/unsymmetrically functionalized B,N,B&#8208;helicenes. Their high photoluminescence quantum yields along with the small &#916;EST suggest their potential as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

      <title>Crystalline Boragermenes</title>
      <dc:description>
A boragermene featuring a double bond between the germanium and boron atoms has been isolated for the first time from a cyclic (alkyl)(boryl)germylene&#8211;PMe3 complex. This compound readily reacts with the Lewis base MeNHC to form the corresponding adduct on the boron center, and also undergoes hydrogenation with H2 across the Ge=B bond.







Abstract
Boragermene 3 featuring a double bond between the Ge and dicoordinate B atoms has been synthesized for the first time by reacting the cyclic (alkyl)(boryl)germylene&#8211;PMe3 adduct 1 with Cl2BN(SiMe3)2 followed by reductive dehalogenation with KC8. Addition of a Lewis base (MeNHC) to 3 leads to the formation of the corresponding adduct 4, which shows double bond character between the Ge and tricoordinate B atoms. Compound 3 undergoes hydrogenation with H2 concomitant with a complete scission of the Ge=B bond.

      <title>The Synthesis of a 2D Ultra&#8208;Large Protein Supramolecular Nanofilm by Chemoselective Thiol&#8211;Disulfide Exchange and its Emergent Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
The thiol&#8211;disulfide exchange reaction between cysteine and lysozyme is used to produce a 2D, thin proteinaceous film with approximately 100&#8201;% optical transparency. This film adheres to a range of surfaces and can be used to encapsulate and release functional molecules, such as proteins.







Abstract
The design and scalable synthesis of robust 2D biological ultrathin films with a tunable structure and function and the ability to be easily transferred to a range of substrates remain key challenges in chemistry and materials science. Herein, we report the use of the thiol&#8211;disulfide exchange reaction in the synthesis of a macroscopic 2D ultrathin proteinaceous film with the potential for large&#8208;scale fabrication and on&#8208;demand encapsulation/release of functional molecules. The reaction between the Cys6&#8211;Cys127 disulfide bond of lysozyme and cysteine is chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective. The partially unfolded lysozyme&#8211;cysteine monomers aggregate at the air/water or solid/liquid interface to form an ultra&#8208;large 2D nanofilm (900&#8197;cm2) with about 100&#8201;% optical transparency. This material adheres to a wide range of substrates and encapsulates and releases a range of molecules without significantly affecting activity.

      <title>Aminoazanium of DABCO: An Amination Reagent for Alkyl and Aryl Pinacol Boronates</title>
      <dc:description>
B to N: The H2N&#8208;DABCO salt has been developed as an amination reagent for the direct amination of alkyl (primary, secondary and tertiary) and aryl pinacol boronates. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of olefins was also achieved by catalytic hydroboration with HBpin and in situ amination using H2N&#8208;DABCO. Moreover, 1,2&#8208;diboration of olefins and subsequent amination achieved the unprecedented 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins. DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.







Abstract
The aminoazanium of DABCO (H2N&#8208;DABCO) has been developed as a general and practical amination reagent for the direct amination of alkyl and aryl pinacol boronates. This compound is stable and practical for use as a reagent. Various primary, secondary. and tertiary alkyl&#8722;Bpin and aryl&#8722;Bpin substrates were aminated to give the corresponding amine derivatives. The amination is stereospecific. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of olefins was easily achieved by catalytic hydroboration with HBpin and in subsequent situ amination using H2N&#8208;DABCO. Moreover, the combination of 1,2&#8208;diboration of olefins, using B2pin2, with this amination process achieved the unprecedented 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins. The amination protocol was also successfully extended to aryl pinacol boronates.

      <title>Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Isoniazid&#8211;Selenium Nanoparticles Promote Antimicrobial Immunity and Synergize Bactericidal Destruction of Tuberculosis Bacilli</title>
      <dc:description>
Destructive duo: The bactericidal effects of selenium nanoparticles (NPs) were combined with the delivery of the drug Isoniazid via the mannose&#8208;decorated nanomaterial Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs for the synergistic drug&#8208;induced and phagolysosomal destruction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).







Abstract
Pathogenesis hallmarks for tuberculosis (TB) are the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) escape from phagolysosomal destruction and limited drug delivery into infected cells. Several nanomaterials can be entrapped in lysosomes, but the development of functional nanomaterials to promote phagolysosomal Mtb clearance remains a big challenge. Here, we report on the bactericidal effects of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) against Mtb and further introduce a novel nanomaterial&#8208;assisted anti&#8208;TB strategy manipulating Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs for synergistic drug&#8208;induced and phagolysosomal destruction of Mtb. Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs preferentially entered macrophages and accumulated in lysosomes releasing Isoniazid. Surprisingly, Ison@Man&#8208;Se/Man&#8208;Se NPs further promoted the fusion of Mtb into lysosomes for synergistic lysosomal and Isoniazid destruction of Mtb. Concurrently, Ison@Man&#8208;Se/Man&#8208;Se NPs also induced autophagy sequestration of Mtb, evolving into lysosome&#8208;associated autophagosomal Mtb degradation linked to ROS&#8208;mitochondrial and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. This novel nanomaterial&#8208;assisted anti&#8208;TB strategy manipulating antimicrobial immunity and Mtb clearance may potentially serve in more effective therapeutics against TB and drug&#8208;resistant TB.

      <title>Bifunctional Nanoscale Assemblies: Multistate Electrochromics Coupled with Charge Trapping and Release</title>
      <dc:description>
The coat of many colors: Colorful coatings can be obtained by arresting electrical charge. A nanoscale bilayer consisting of different metal complexes was used to demonstrate both charge trapping and release correlated with multicolored electrochromism.







Abstract
We demonstrate controlled charge trapping and release, accompanied by multiple color changes in a metallo&#8208;organic bilayer. The dual functionality of the metallo&#8208;organic materials provides fundamental insight into the metal&#8208;mediated electron transport pathways. The electrochemical processes are visualized by distinct, four color&#8208;to&#8208;color transitions: red, transparent, orange, and brown. The bilayer is composed of two elements: 1)&#8197;a nanoscale gate consisting of a layer of well&#8208;defined polypyridyl ruthenium complexes bound to a flexible transparent electrode, and 2)&#8197;a charge storage layer consisting of isostructural iron complexes attached to the surface of the gate. This gate mediates or blocks electron transport in response to an applied voltage. The charge storage and release depend on the oxidation state of the layer of ruthenium complexes (=gate). Combining electrochemistry with optical data revealed mechanistic information: the brown coloration of the bilayer directly relates to the formation of intermediate ruthenium species, providing evidence for catalytic positive charge release mediated through the gate.

      <dc:description>Making use of the programmability and structural flexibility of the DNA molecule, we designed a DNA origami nanoarm capable of undergoing large deformation. Our DNA origami nanoarm comprised serially repeated tension&#8208;adjustable modules, the cumulative actuation of which resulted in a large deformation of the arm structure, which transformed from a linear shape into an arched shape. Combining atomic force microscopy imaging and theoretical analyses based on the mechanics of materials, we demonstrate that the degree of deformation can be systematically controlled by merely replacing a set of strands that is required for the actuation of the module. Moreover, by employing a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence for the actuation, we could achieve reversible ion&#8208;induced contraction and relaxation of the nanoarm.

      <title>Triple Helix Stabilizing Effects in Collagen Model Peptides
Containing PPII Helix&#8208;Preorganized Diproline Modules</title>
      <dc:description>Collagen model peptides (CMPs) serve as tools for under&#173;standing stability and function of the collagen triple helix and have a potential for biomedical applications. In the past, inter&#8208;strand cross&#8208;linking or conformational preconditioning of proline units through stereoelectronic effects have been utilized in the design of stabilized CMPs. To further study the effects determining collagen triple helix stability we investigated a series of CMPs containing synthetic diproline&#8208;mimicking modules (ProMs), which are preorganized in a PPII helix&#8208;type conformation by a functionalizable intra&#8208;strand C2&#8208;bridge. Results of CD&#8208;based denaturation studies were correlated with calculated (DFT) conformational preferences of the ProM units revealing that the relative helix stability is mainly governed by an interplay of main chain preorganization, ring flip preference, adaptability and steric effects. Triple helix integrity was proven by crystal structure analysis and binding to HSP47.</dc:description>
