      <title>Rapid, label&#8208;free optical spectroscopy platform for diagnosis of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we propose the use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to determine spectral markers that can aid in the recognition of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;diagnose immune&#8208;related complication that often leads to limb ischemia and thromboembolism . The ability to produce distinct molecular signatures without requiring addition of exogenous labels enables unbiased inquiry and makes SERS an attractive complementary diagnostic tool for various complex pathologies. Specifically, we have designed a new plasmonic capillary flow platform that offers ultrasensitive , label&#8208;free measurement capability as well as efficient handling of blood serum samples. The optimized capillary channel shows excellent reproducibility and long&#8208;term stability and, crucially, provides an alternative diagnostic rubric for determination of HIT by leveraging machine&#8208;learning based classification of the spectroscopic data. With further refinement, we envision that a portable Raman instrument could be combined with the capillary&#8208;based SERS analytical tool for rapid, non&#8208;destructive determination of HIT in the clinical laboratory, without perturbing the existing diagnostic workflow.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Iron&#8208;Nickel Nanoparticles for Magnetically&#8208;Induced CO2 Methanation in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>Induction heating of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) has been recently explored as a new methodology to activate heterogeneous catalytic reactions. This approach requires the design and the synthesis of nano&#8208;objects displaying both a high heating power and an excellent catalytic activity. Here, using a surface engineering approach, we report for the first time the use of bimetallic NPs for magnetically&#8208;induced CO2 methanation which acts both as heating agent and as catalyst. Thus, we describe the organometallic synthesis of Fe30Ni70 NPs, displaying high heating powers at low magnetic field amplitudes. These NPs are active but only slightly selective for CH4 after deposition on SirAlOx due to the presence of an iron rich shell (25 mL&#183;min&#8208;1, 25 mT, 300 kHz, conversion 71%, methane selectivity 65%). Remarkably, a proper surface engineering consisting in depositing a thin Ni layer leads to Fe30Ni70@Ni NPs displaying a very high activity for CO2 hydrogenation and a full selectivity. For the first time, a quantitative yield in methane is obtained at low magnetic field and mild conditions (25 mL&#183;min&#8208;1, 19 mT, 300 kHz, conversion 100%, methane selectivity 100%).</dc:description>

      <title>Complete Switch of Directional Selectivity in the Formal Hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Enynes with Simple Hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling reaction selectivity is a permanent pursuit for chemists. In particular, regio&#8208;selective catalysis, which exploits and/or overcomes innate steric and electronic bias to deliver diverse regio&#8208;enriched products from the same starting materials, represents a powerful tool for divergent synthesis. Recently,  our group reported the 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with simple hydrazones to generate branched allylic compounds when a nickel catalyst was used. As part of the effort, herein we show that a complete switch of Markovnikov to anti&#8208;Markovnikov directionality is obtained by slightly changing to a ruthenium catalyst, thus providing a direct and efficient access to the homoallylic products exclusively.  Isotopic substitution experiments indicate that no reversible hydro&#8208;metallation across the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl system occurred under ruthenium catalysis.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Highly Stable Zirconium(IV) Coordination Cages with Aggregation Induced Emission Molecular Rotors for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly stable coordination cages with trinuclear zirconium vertices and flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers were formed by self&#8208;assembly. The two water&#8208;stable cages exhibit impressive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics contributed by the molecular rotors and can be employed as biological fluorescent probes for live&#8208;cell imaging.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of highly stable zirconium(IV)&#8208;based coordination cages with aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecular rotors for in&#8197;vitro bio&#8208;imaging is reported. The two coordination cages, NUS&#8208;100 and NUS&#8208;101, are assembled from the highly stable trinuclear zirconium vertices and two flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers. Extensive experimental and theoretical results show that the emissive intensity of the coordination cages can be controlled by restricting the dynamics of AIE&#8208;active molecular rotors though multiple external stimuli. Because the two coordination cages have excellent chemical stability in aqueous solutions (pH stability: 2&#8211;10) and impressive AIE characteristics contributed by the molecular rotors, they can be employed as novel biological fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vitro live&#8208;cell imaging.

      <title>Biosynthesis of the N&#8211;N&#8208;Bond&#8208;Containing Compound l&#8208;Alanosine</title>
      <dc:description>
A means to an N&#8722;N: Among N&#8208;N&#8208;bond&#8208;containing compounds, biosynthetic routes to diazeniumdiolates remain enigmatic. The biosynthetic pathway for the diazeniumdiolate&#8208;containing amino acid l&#8208;alanosine was elucidated. The two nitrogen atoms in the diazeniumdiolate of l&#8208;alanosine are shown to be derived from glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and the early steps of the biosynthetic pathway were elucidated by using both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo approaches.







Abstract
The formation of a N&#8722;N bond is a unique biochemical transformation, and nature employs diverse biosynthetic strategies to activate nitrogen for bond formation. Among molecules that contain a N&#8722;N bond, biosynthetic routes to diazeniumdiolates remain enigmatic. We here report the biosynthetic pathway for the diazeniumdiolate&#8208;containing amino acid l&#8208;alanosine. Our work reveals that the two nitrogen atoms in the diazeniumdiolate of l&#8208;alanosine arise from glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and we clarify the early steps of the biosynthetic pathway by using both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo approaches. Our work demonstrates a peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein&#8208;based mechanism for activation of the precursor l&#8208;diaminopropionate, and we also show that nitric oxide can participate in non&#8208;enzymatic diazeniumdiolate formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gene alnA, which encodes a fusion protein with an N&#8208;terminal cupin domain and a C&#8208;terminal AraC&#8208;like DNA&#8208;binding domain, is required for alanosine biosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A means to an N&#8722;N&lt;/b&gt;: Among N&#8208;N&#8208;bond&#8208;containing compounds, biosynthetic routes to diazeniumdiolates remain enigmatic. The biosynthetic pathway for the diazeniumdiolate&#8208;containing amino acid &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;alanosine was elucidated. The two nitrogen atoms in the diazeniumdiolate of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;alanosine are shown to be derived from glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and the early steps of the biosynthetic pathway were elucidated by using both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo approaches.

&lt;p&gt;The formation of a N&#8722;N bond is a unique biochemical transformation, and nature employs diverse biosynthetic strategies to activate nitrogen for bond formation. Among molecules that contain a N&#8722;N bond, biosynthetic routes to diazeniumdiolates remain enigmatic. We here report the biosynthetic pathway for the diazeniumdiolate&#8208;containing amino acid &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;alanosine.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Selective Defluoroborylation of Polyfluoroarenes, gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes, and Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
A practical and selective defluoroborylation of polyfluoroarenes, gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, and trifluoromethylalkenes was developed through photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;induced B&#8722;H activation to synthesize fluorinated organoboranes as the building blocks for value&#8208;added organofluorine compounds.







Abstract
Fluorinated organoboranes serve as versatile synthetic precursors for the preparation of value&#8208;added fluorinated organic compounds. Recent progress has been mainly focused on the transition&#8208;metal catalyzed defluoroborylation. Herein, we report a photocatalytic defluoroborylation platform through direct B&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene boranes, through the synergistic merger of a photoredox catalyst and a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. This atom&#8208;economic and operationally simple protocol has enabled defluoroborylation of an extremely broad scope of multifluorinated substrates including polyfluoroarenes, gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, and trifluoromethylalkenes in a highly selective fashion. Intriguingly, the defluoroborylation protocol can be transition&#8208;metal free, and the regioselectivity obtained is complementary to the reported transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis in many cases.

      <title>Radical Dehydroxymethylative Fluorination of Carbohydrates and Divergent Transformations of the Resulting Reverse Glycosyl Fluorides</title>
      <dc:description>
Sweet fluorination: The radical dehydroxymethylative fluorination of carbohydrate alcohols affords a wide arrange of reverse glycosyl fluorides (RGFs) in good to excellent yields. Catalytic C&#8722;F bond activation of these products and further transformations with various nucleophiles demonstrate the potential of this method in late&#8208;stage carbohydrate diversification.







Abstract
A mild and convenient method for the synthesis of reverse glycosyl fluorides (RGFs) has been developed that is based on the silver&#8208;promoted radical dehydroxymethylative fluorination of carbohydrates. A salient feature of the reaction is that furanoid and pyranoid carbohydrates furnish structurally diverse RGFs bearing a wide variety of functional groups in good to excellent yields. Intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer experiments revealed that the reaction involves an underexploited radical fluorination that proceeds via &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of sugar&#8208;derived primary alkoxyl radicals. Structurally divergent RGFs were obtained by catalytic C&#8722;F bond activation, and our method thus offers a concise and efficient strategy for the synthesis of reverse glycosides by late&#8208;stage diversification of RGFs. The potential of this method is showcased by the preparation and diversification of sotagliflozin, leading to the discovery of a promising SGLT2 inhibitor candidate.

Back to bases: The first parent phosphanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes stabilized only by a Lewis base were synthesized. These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl and LiPH2&#8901;DME and a H2 elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H3 and PH3, respectively.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the first parent phosphanylalane and phosphanylgallane stabilized only by a Lewis base (LB) are reported. The corresponding substituted compounds, such as IDipp&#8901;GaH2PCy2 (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were obtained by the reaction of LiPCy2 with IDipp&#8901;GaH2Cl. However, the LB&#8208;stabilized parent compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH2PH2 (3) and IDipp&#8901;AlH2PH2 (4) were prepared via a salt metathesis of LiPH2&#8901;DME with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) or by H2&#8208;elimination reactions of IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H3 (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) and PH3, respectively. The compounds could be isolated as crystalline solids and completely characterized. Supporting DFT computations gave insight into the reaction pathways as well as into the stability of these compounds with respect to their decomposition behavior.

      <title>Molecularly Engineered Macrophage&#8208;Derived Exosomes with Inflammation Tropism and Intrinsic Heme Biosynthesis for Atherosclerosis Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes molecularly engineered with the drug hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) can actively target and transmigrate to atherosclerotic lesions, wherein the biosynthesis and metabolism of heme induced by HAL produces CO and bilirubin.

Abstract
Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases worldwide, and alleviating inflammation is a promising strategy for AS treatment. Here, we report molecularly engineered M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M2 Exo) with inflammation&#8208;tropism and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities for AS imaging and therapy. M2 Exo are derived from M2 macrophages and further electroporated with FDA&#8208;approved hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL). After systematic administration, the engineered M2 Exo exhibit excellent inflammation&#8208;tropism and anti&#8208;inflammation effects via the surface&#8208;bonded chemokine receptors and the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines released from the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages. Moreover, the encapsulated HAL can undergo intrinsic biosynthesis and metabolism of heme to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide and bilirubin, which further enhance the anti&#8208;inflammation effects and finally alleviate AS. Meanwhile, the intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) of the heme biosynthesis pathway permits the fluorescence imaging and tracking of AS.

      <title>Uncovering the Shuttle Effect in Organic Batteries and Counter&#8208;Strategies Thereof: A Case Study of the N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dimethylphenazine Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>
Whodunnit? The detrimental shuttle effect in organic batteries is proposed to be based on electron hopping through a self&#8208;exchange process, rather than by molecular diffusion as conventionally understood. The findings have led to two counter&#8208;strategies to inhibit this shuttle mechanism.







Abstract
The main drawback of organic electrode materials is their solubility in the electrolyte, leading to the shuttle effect. Using N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylphenazine (DMPZ) as a highly soluble cathode material, and its PF6&#8722; and triflimide salts as models for its first oxidation state, a poor correlation was found between solubility and battery operability. Extensive electrochemical experiments suggest that the shuttle effect is unlikely to be mediated by molecular diffusion as commonly understood, but rather by electron&#8208;hopping via the electron self&#8208;exchange reaction based on spectroscopic results. These findings led to two counter&#8208;strategies to prevent the hopping process: the pre&#8208;treatment of the anode to form a solid&#8211;electrolyte interface and using DMPZ salt rather than neutral DMPZ as the active material. These strategies improved coulombic efficiency and capacity retention, demonstrating that solubility of organic materials does not necessarily exclude their applications in batteries.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Uncovering the Shuttle Effect in Organic Batteries and Counter&#8208;Strategies Thereof: A Case Study of the N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dimethylphenazine Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whodunnit?&lt;/b&gt; The detrimental shuttle effect in organic batteries is proposed to be based on electron hopping through a self&#8208;exchange process, rather than by molecular diffusion as conventionally understood. The findings have led to two counter&#8208;strategies to inhibit this shuttle mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drawback of organic electrode materials is their solubility in the electrolyte, leading to the shuttle effect. Using N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylphenazine (DMPZ) as a highly soluble cathode material, and its PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and triflimide salts as models for its first oxidation state, a poor correlation was found between solubility and battery operability. Extensive electrochemical experiments suggest that the shuttle effect is unlikely to be mediated by molecular diffusion as commonly understood, but rather by electron&#8208;hopping via the electron self&#8208;exchange reaction based on spectroscopic results. These findings led to two counter&#8208;strategies to prevent the hopping process: the pre&#8208;treatment of the anode to form a solid&#8211;electrolyte interface and using DMPZ salt rather than neutral DMPZ as the active material. These strategies improved coulombic efficiency and capacity retention, demonstrating that solubility of organic materials does not necessarily exclude their applications in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular&#8208;Sieving Membrane by Partitioning the Channels in Ultrafiltration Membrane by In&#8197;Situ Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Confined&#8208;polymerization partitioning in commercial ultrafiltration membrane pores is reported to prepare gas molecular&#8208;sieving membranes. Besides remarkable hydrogen purification performance, outstanding long&#8208;term stability and aging resistance are achieved owing to the creation of intrinsic micropores by crosslinking of multi&#8208;functionalized rigid building units.







Abstract
Commercial ultrafiltration membranes have proliferated globally for water treatment. However, their pore sizes are too large to sieve gases. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) feature well&#8208;developed microporosity yet are difficult to be fabricated into membranes. Herein, we report a strategy to prepare molecular&#8208;sieving membranes by partitioning the mesoscopic channels in water ultrafiltration membrane (PSU) into ultra&#8208;micropores by space&#8208;confined polymerization of multi&#8208;functionalized rigid building units. Nine CMP@PSU membranes were obtained, and their separation performance for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 pairs surpass the Robeson upper bound and rival against the best of those reported membranes. Furthermore, highly crosslinked skeletons inside the channels result in the structural robustness and transfer into the excellent aging resistance of the CMP@PSU. This strategy may shed light on the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes.

      <title>A Supported Bismuth Halide Perovskite Photocatalyst for Selective Aliphatic and Aromatic C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Better with bismuth: A range of mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;supported small bismuth halide perovskite nanoparticles were prepared. They were found to be very promising photocatalysts for selective aromatic and aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Direct selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to oxygenates by O2 is challenging. Catalysts are limited by the low activity and narrow application scope, and the main focus is on active C&#8722;H bonds at benzylic positions. In this work, stable, lead&#8208;free, Cs3Bi2Br9 halide perovskites are integrated within the pore channels of mesoporous SBA&#8208;15 silica and demonstrate their photocatalytic potentials for C&#8722;H bond activation. The composite photocatalysts can effectively oxidize hydrocarbons (C5 to C16 including aromatic and aliphatic alkanes) with a conversion rate up to 32900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and excellent selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) towards aldehydes and ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Isotopic labeling, in&#8197;situ spectroscopic studies, and DFT calculations reveal that well&#8208;dispersed small perovskite nanoparticles (2&#8211;5&#8197;nm) possess enhanced electron&#8211;hole separation and a close contact with hydrocarbons that facilitates C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photoinduced charges.

      <title>Phenol&#8208;Derived Carbon Sealant Inspired by a Coalification Process</title>
      <dc:description>
The phenol&#8208;derived carbon sealant inspired by the coalification process was developed by thermal annealing of a polyphenolic compounds. The compounds undergo oxidation for surface functionalization and the reductive annealing for developing electrically conductive properties. The resulting sealant, which is a conductive graphitic carbon material, can seal graphene fragments physically and electrically.







Abstract
Recently, emerging functions utilizing phenolic molecules, such as surface functionalizing agents or bioadhesives, have attracted significant interest. However, the most important role of phenolic compounds is to produce carbonized plant matter called &#8220;coal&#8221;, which is widely used as an energy source in nearly all countries. Coalification is a long&#8208;term, high&#8208;temperature process in which phenols are converted into conducting carbonized matter. This study focuses on mimicking coalification processes to create conducting sealants from non&#8208;conducting phenolic compounds by heat treatment. We demonstrate that a phenolic adhesive, tri&#8208;hydroxybenzene (known as pyrogallol), and polyethylenimine mixture initially acts as an adhesive sealant that can be converted to a conducting carbon sealing material. The conductivity of the phenolic sealant is about 850&#8197;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement of the performance of carbon matter. Applications of the biomimetic adhesives described herein include conducting defect sealants in carbon nanomaterials and conducting binders for metal/carbon or ceramic/carbon composites.

      <title>Enriching and Quantifying Porous Single Layer 2D Polymers by Exfoliation of Chemically Modified van der Waals Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D polymer with pyrylium groups is transformed into a 2D polymer with pyridine groups by exposure to gaseous ammonia. Liquid phase exfoliation of the latter yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Nanosheet quantification shows that the exfoliation is comparable to graphite, demonstrating the promising potential of this approach, which could also be applied to covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
2D polymer sheets with six positively charged pyrylium groups at each pore edge in a stacked single crystal can be transformed into a 2D polymer with six pyridines per pore by exposure to gaseous ammonia. This reaction furnishes still a crystalline material with tunable protonation degree at regular nano&#8208;sized pores promising as separation membrane. The exfoliation is compared for both 2D polymers with the latter being superior. Its liquid phase exfoliation yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Monolayer contents of &#8776;30&#8201;% are achieved with &#8776;130&#8197;nm sized sheets in mg quantities, corresponding to tens of trillions of monolayers. Quantification of nanosheet sizes, layer number and mass shows that this exfoliation is comparable to graphite. Thus, we expect that recent advances in exfoliation of graphite or inorganic crystals (e.g. scale&#8208;up, printing etc.) can be directly applied to this 2D polymer as well as to covalent organic frameworks.

      <title>[SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+: Highly Coordinated Sn+III8 Subunit with Fragile Carbonyl Clips</title>
      <dc:description>
You're clinging! In a clip&#8208;like fashion, Fe(CO)4 groups surround a central SnI8 subunit in [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+, which has an unprecedentedly high coordination of tin with the most voluminous, stable halide.







Abstract
[SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4][Al2Cl7]2 contains the [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+ cation with an unprecedented highly coordinated, bicapped SnI8 prism. Given the eightfold coordination with the most voluminous stable halide, it is all the more surprising that this SnI8 arrangement is surrounded only by fragile Fe(CO)4 groups in a clip&#8208;like fashion. Inspite of a predominantly ionic bonding situation in [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+, the I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722; distances are considerably shortened (down to 371&#8197;pm) and significantly less than the van der Waals distance (420&#8197;pm). The title compound is characterized by single&#8208;crystal structure analysis, spectroscopic methods (EDXS, FTIR, Raman, UV/Vis, M&#246;ssbauer), thermogravimetry, and density functional theory methods.

      <dc:description>
Remote control: Two methyl groups strategically located at the backbone of the imidazolium component of a gold&#8208;based catalyst are essential to deliver the desired binapthol compounds in up to 97&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A highly atroposelective (up to 97&#8201;% ee) Au&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;diols is reported starting from a range of substituted benzyl alkynones. Essential for the achievement of high enantioselectivity during the key assembly of the naphto&#8208;3&#8208;ol unit is the use of TADDOL&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonites as ancillary ligands. Preliminary results demonstrate that the transformation of the obtained binaphthyls into axially chiral monodentate phosphines is possible without degradation of enantiopurity.

      <title>Determination of complex small molecule structures using molecular alignment simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Correct&#160;structural assignment of small molecules and natural products is critical for drug discovery and organic chemistry. Anisotropy&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for structural assignment of organic molecules, but relies on utilization of a medium that disrupts the isotropic motion of molecules in organic solvents. Here, we establish a quantitative correlation between the atomic structure of the alignment medium, the molecular structure of the small molecule and molecule&#8208;specific anisotropic NMR parameters. The quantitative correlation uses an accurate three&#8208;dimensional molecular alignment model that predicts residual dipolar couplings of small molecules aligned by&#160;poly( &#947; &#8208;benzyl&#8208;&#671;&#8208;glutamate).

      <dc:description>The emerging metal single&#8208;atom catalyst has aroused extensive attentions in multiple fields such as clean energy, environmental protection, biomedicine, etc. Unfortunately, though it has been proved to be highly active, the origins of the activity of the single&#8208;atom sites remain unrevealed to date due to the lack of deep insight on electronic level.

Abstract
3D printing, on all scales, is currently a vibrant topic in scientific and industrial research as it has enormous potential to radically change manufacturing. Owing to the inherent nature of the manufacturing process, 3D printed structures may require additional material to structurally support complex features. Such support material must be removed after printing&#8212;sometimes termed subtractive manufacturing&#8212;without adversely affecting the remaining structure. An elegant solution is the use of photoresists containing labile bonds that allow for controlled cleavage with specific triggers. Herein, we explore state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cleavable photoresists for 3D direct laser writing, as well as their potential to combine additive and subtractive manufacturing in a hybrid technology. We discuss photoresist design, feature resolution, cleavage properties, and current limitations of selected examples. Furthermore, we share our perspective on possible labile bonds, and their corresponding cleavage trigger, which we believe will have a critical impact on future applications and expand the toolbox of available cleavable photoresists.

      <title>Mapping Enzyme Activity on Tissue by Functional Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
By bringing together the specificity of enzymes to their substrates with mass spectrometry imaging, an approach has been developed that can reveal the location and efficacy of enzymatic activity in histological tissue sections with the analytical confidence of mass spectrometry detection. This approach is referred to as functional mass spectrometry imaging (fMSI).







Abstract
Enzymes are central components of most physiological processes, and are consequently implicated in various pathologies. High&#8208;resolution maps of enzyme activity within tissues therefore represent powerful tools for elucidating enzymatic functions in health and disease. Here, we present a novel mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) method for assaying the spatial distribution of enzymatic activity directly from tissue. MSI analysis of tissue sections exposed to phospholipid substrates produced high&#8208;resolution maps of phospholipase activity and specificity, which could subsequently be compared to histological images of the same section. Functional MSI thus represents a new and generalisable method for imaging biological activity in&#8197;situ.

      <title>A Dual Threat: Redox&#8208;Activity and Electronic Structures of Well&#8208;Defined Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fulleretic Covalent&#8208;Organic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The effect of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) alignment on the materials electronic structure was probed for the first time using novel purely organic porous crystalline materials with covalently integrated two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional acceptors.

      <title>Mitochondrial DNA&#8208;targeted IrIII&#8208;Containing Metallohelices with Tunable Photodynamic Therapy Efficacy in Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>The development of DNA&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents for cancer treatment has drawn substantial attention. Here, the design and synthesis of dinuclear Ir  III  &#8208;containing luminescent metallohelices with tunable PDT efficacy that targeting mitochondrial DNA in cancer cells are reported. The metallohelices are fabricated using the dynamic imine&#8208;coupling chemistry between aldehyde end&#8208;capped fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)  3  handles and linear alkanediamine spacers, followed by the reduction of the imine&#8208;linkages. Interestingly, the length and odd&#8208;even character of the diamine alkyl linker determined the stereochemical structures (helicates vs mesocates). In contrast to the helicates, the mesocates exhibit improved therapeutic effects for inducing cell apoptosis upon white light irradiation . Molecular docking studies indicate that the mesocates, with a proper length of diamine spacers, show stronger DNA&#8208;binding affinities in a minor groove manner. This study highlights the potential of DNA&#8208;targeting Ir  III  &#8208;containing metallohelices as PDT agents and demonstrates that altering the structures of metallohelices can have profound effects on PDT cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

      <title>Intrinsically Low Thermal Conductivity and High Carrier Mobility in Dual Topological Quantum Material, n&#8208;type BiTe</title>
      <dc:description>The grand challenge in thermoelectrics is to achieve the intrinsically low thermal conductivity in crystalline solids while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#181;). While topological quantum materials such as topological insulator (TI) or topological crystalline insulator (TCI) can exhibit high &#181;, weak topological insulators (WTI) are of interest due to their layered hetero&#8208;structural nature which is intriguing for exhibiting low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat). BiTe, a unique member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series (where m:n = 1:2), possesses both the quantum states, TCI and WTI, which is distinct from the conventional strong TI, Bi2Te3 (where m:n = 0:1). In BiTe, Bi&#8208;Bi zigzag bilayer is sandwiched between the Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te quintuple layers bonded via weak van der Waals interactions. Here, we report intrinsically low &#954;lat of 0.47&#8208; 0.8 W/mK in the 300&#8208;650 K range in BiTe due to the presence of low energy optical phonon branches which originate primarily from the localized vibrations of Bi bilayer. These soft optical modes couple strongly with the acoustic modes, hindering the propagation of acoustic phonons, resulting in a low &#954;lat. BiTe exhibits negative Seebeck coefficients attributing to n&#8208;type electronic conduction. BiTe possesses high &#181; of ~ 516 cm2/Vs and 707 cm2/Vs along parallel and perpendicular to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) directions, respectively, at room temperature. Electronic structure of BiTe reveals that multiple band extrema in the conduction bands with nearly linear dispersion in a narrow energy window (~25 meV) corresponding to the thermal energy at room temperature, resulting in a facile conduction channel; hence supports manifestation of high &#181;.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulation of Prins Cyclization by Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;molecule strong coupling has emerged within the last decade as an entirely new method to control chemical reactions.

While the potential of VSC in organic chemistry appears enormous, only a limited number of reactions have been investigated under VSC to date, including solvolysis and deprotection reactions. Here we investigate the effect of VSC on a series of aldehydes and ketones undergoing Prins cyclization, an important synthetic step in pharmaceutical chemistry. We observe a decrease of the second&#8208;order rate constant with VSC of the reactant carbonyl stretching groups. We measure an increased activation energy due to VSC, but proportional changes in activation enthalpy and entropy suggest no substantive change in reaction pathway.

      <title>Phosphorus vacancies boost electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution by two orders of magnitude</title>
      <dc:description>Vacancy engineering is an effective strategy to manipulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their performance; while few reports focus on phosphorus vacancies (Pv). Herein, we report the creation of Pv in metal phosphides and investigate their role in alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Pv&#8208;modified catalyst requires a minimum onset potential of 0 mV vs RHE, a small overpotential of 27.7 mV to achieve 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  geometric current density and a Tafel slope of 30.88 mV dec  &#8208;1  , even outperforms Pt/C benchmark (32.7 mV@10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 30.90 mV dec  &#8208;1  ). This catalyst also displays superior stability up to 504 hours without any decay. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest Pv can weaken the hybridization of Ni 3d and P 2p orbitals, enriching the electron density of Ni and P atoms nearby Pv, facilitating H* desorption process, contributing to outstanding HER activity and facile kinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes: High Sterically Derived Selectivity from a Pyridyl&#8208;Imidazoline Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>The steric effects of substituents on five&#8208;membered rings are less pronounced than those on six&#8208;membered rings because of the difference in bond angles. Thus, the regioselectivities of reactions that occur with selectivities dictated by steric effects, such as the borylation of C&#8208;H bonds, have been poor in many cases. We report that the silylation of five&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes occurs with high sterically derived regioselectivity when catalyzed by the combination of [Ir(cod)(OMe)]  2  and a phenanthroline ligand or a new pyridyl&#8208;imidazoline ligand that further increases the regioselectivity. The silylation reactions with these catalysts produce high yields of heteroarylsilanes from functionalization at the most sterically accessible C&#8211;H bonds of these rings under conditions that the borylation of C&#8211;H bonds with previously reported catalysts formed mixtures of products or products that are unstable. The heteroarylsilane products undergo cross&#8208;coupling reactions and substitution reactions with  ipso  selectivity to generate heteroarenes that bear halogen, aryl and perfluoroalkyl substituents.</dc:description>

      <title>Intracellular Electrochemical Nanomeasurements Reveal that Exocytosis of Molecules at Living Neurons is Subquantal and Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Since the early work of Bernard Katz, the process of cellular chemical communication via exocytosis, quantal release, has been considered to be all or none. Recent evidence has shown exocytosis to be partial or &#8216;subquantal&#8217; at single&#8208;cell model systems, but there is a need to understand this at communicating nerve cells. Partial release allows nerve cells to control the signal at the site of release during individual events, where the smaller the fraction released, the greater the range of regulation. Here we show that the fraction of the vesicular octopamine content released from a living&#160;  Drosophila  &#160;larval neuromuscular neuron is very small. The percentage of released molecules was found to be only 4.5% for simple events and 10.7% for complex (i.e., oscillating or flickering) events. This large content, combined with partial release controlled by fluctuations of the fusion pore, offers presynaptic plasticity that can be widely regulated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The typical linewidths of&#160;  1  H NMR spectra of powdered organic solids at 111 kHz magic angle spinning (MAS) are of the order of a few hundred Hertz. While this is remarkable&#160; in comparison to the tens of kHz observed in spectra of static samples, it is still the key limit to the use of&#160;  1  H in solid&#8208;state NMR, especially for complex systems. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to further improve the spectral resolution. We show that the anti&#8208;z&#8208;COSY experiment can be used to reduce the residual line broadening of&#160;  1  H NMR spectra of powdered organic solids. Results obtained with the anti&#8208;z&#8208;COSY sequence at 100 kHz MAS on thymol,&#160; &#946; &#8208;AspAla, and strychnine &#160;show an improvement in resolution of up to a factor of two compared to conventional spectra acquired at the same spinning rate.</dc:description>

However, precise tuning of these aspects is largely missing in the design of artificial catalysts. Here, we used a series of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), not only overcame the limit of distance between active sites in bio&#8208;systems, but also unveiled the critical role of this distance for efficient catalysis.

A weakly&#8208;donating diphosphite, Kelliphite forms a deep unsymmetrical pocket, which is essential for stereoselective  anti&#8208;attack of external amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Controlling Single Molecule Conductance by Chemical Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Among the prerequisites for the progress of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based electronic devices are a better understanding of the electronic properties at the individual molecular level and the development of methods to tune the charge transport through molecular junctions. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is an ideal tool not only for the characterization, but also for the manipulation of single atoms and molecules on surfaces.

The conductance through a single molecule can be measured by contacting the molecule with atomic precision and forming a molecular bridge between the metallic STM tip electrode and the metallic surface electrode. The parameters affecting the conductance are mainly related to their electronic structure and to the coupling to the metallic electrodes. Here, the experimental and theoretical analyses are focused on single tetracenothiophene molecules and demonstrate that an in&#8208;situ&#8208;induced direct desulfurization reaction of the thiophene moiety strongly improves the molecular anchoring by forming covalent bonds between molecular carbon and copper surface atoms. This bond formation leads to an increase of the conductance by about 50% compared to the initial state.</dc:description>

      <title>The Redox Coupling Effect in a Photocatalytic RuII&#8208;PdII Cage with TTF Guest as Electron Relay Mediator for Visible&#8208;Light Hydrogen&#8208;Evolving Promotion</title>
      <dc:description>
A nanospace coupling effect in a photocatalytic Ru(II)&#8211;Pd(II) cage via redox interplay between confined TTF guest and photosensitizing host for visible&#8208;light hydrogen&#8208;evolving promotion is described by C.&#8208;Y. Su and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913303). In the confined nanospace of a photocatalytic cage, the TTF guest acts as electron relay mediator to modulate the electron&#8208;transfer process through coupling with photoredox cycle of the cage, leading to significant improvement of hydrogen&#8208;evolving efficiency.

      <dc:description>Generally, enzymes contain several subunits to maintain different biological functions in live systems. However, it still remains a great challenge for specific discrimination of one subunit over another. Toward this end, we present the first fluorescent probe TPEMA for highly specific detection of B subunit of cytosolic creatine (CK) kinase isoenzyme (CK&#8208;B). Due to its aggregation&#8208;induced emission property, TPEMA shows highly boosted emission toward CK&#8208;B with fast response time and very low interference from other analytes including M subunit of CK (CK&#8208;M). With the aid of Job's plot assay, ITC assay and molecular dynamics simulation, for the first time we directly confirmed that the remarkably enhanced fluorescence of TPEMA in the presence of CK&#8208;B results from the restriction of single molecular motion in the cavity. Selective wash&#8208;free fluorescence imaging of CK&#8208;B in macrophages under different treatments was successfully demonstrated. This work can shed much light on future fluorescent probes for light&#8208;up detection of other subunit&#8208;specific enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced Single&#8208;Electron Transfer as an Enabling Principle in the Radical Borylation of Alkenes with NHC&#8211;Borane</title>
      <dc:description>
A photoinduced SET process enables the direct B&#8722;H bond activation of NHC&#8211;boranes. The resulting NHC&#8211;boryl radical was used for the borylation of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes and alkenes with diverse electronic and structural features, providing facile access to highly functionalized borylated molecules.







Abstract
A photoinduced SET process enables the direct B&#8722;H bond activation of NHC&#8211;boranes. In contrast to common hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) strategies, this photoinduced reaction simply takes advantage of the beneficial redox potentials of NHC&#8211;boranes, thus obviating the need for extra radical initiators. The resulting NHC&#8211;boryl radical was used for the borylation of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes and alkenes with diverse electronic and structural features, providing facile access to highly functionalized borylated molecules. Labeling and photoquenching experiments provide insight into the mechanism of this photoinduced SET pathway.

      <title>Li/Garnet Interface Stabilization by Thermal&#8208;decomposition Vapor Deposition of an Amorphous Carbon Layer</title>
      <dc:description>Applying interlayers is the main strategy to address the large area specific resistance (ASR) of Li/garnet interface. However, studies on eliminating the Li  2  CO  3  and LiOH interfacial lithiophobic contaminants are still insufficient.

Due to the protection of the carbon layer, the air stability of LLZTO is also improved. Moreover, owing to the amorphous structure of the low graphitized carbon (LGC), instant lithiation is achieved, and the ASR of the Li/LLZTO interface is reduced to 9 &#937; cm  2  . Lithium volatilization and Zr  4+  reduction are also controllable during TVD.

      <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of Copper&#8208;based Electrocatalyst for Selective Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>Unveiling the active phase of catalytic materials under reaction conditions is important for the designed construction of efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction to ammonia. Here, we probed the origin of the prominent activity enhancement for CuO (Faradaic efficiency: 95.8%, Selectivity: 81.2%) toward selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia.  15  N isotope labeling experiments proved that ammonia originated from nitrate reduction. Both the  1  H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and colorimetric methods were performed to quantify ammonia.  In situ  Raman and  ex situ  experiments revealed that CuO was electrochemically converted into Cu/Cu  2  O, which serves as an active phase. The combined results of online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the electron transfer from Cu  2  O to Cu at the interface could facilitate the formation of  *  NOH intermediate and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of a hemispherical geodesic phenine framework via a polygon assembling strategy</title>
      <dc:description>A synthetic strategy to construct large geodesic structures of phenine (1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted benzene) was devised. The strategy assembled five pentagons on an omphalos pentagon and, bridging peripheral pentagons, furnished five additional hexagons. Thirty phenine units were synthetically assembled to afford a large C  220  H  180  molecule having a phenine framework isoreticular to a hemispherical, bisected segment of C  60  . Although a hemispherical structure of the phenine framework was suggested by solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra, the crystallographic analysis revealed an ovally deformed structure of the molecule. In&#8208;depth structural analyses including theoretical calculations showed that fluctuations at biaryl torsions allowed for the structural deformations and, at the same time, that the dynamic fluctuations resulted in the spectroscopic observation of the hemispherical structure as a time&#8208;averaged structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Direct Aldol Addition of Aryl Ketones to &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated chiral tertiary alcohols from (hetero)aryl methyl ketones is described. The use of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase was found to facilitate direct aldol addition by providing the strong Br&#248;nsted basicity required for rapid aryl enolate formation. The new synthetic protocol is easy to perform and tolerates a broad range of functionalities and heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er). Multi&#8208;gram scalability has been demonstrated along with catalyst recovery and recycling. NMR studies identified a 1400&#8208;fold rate enhancement under BIMP catalysis, compared to the current state of the art catalytic system. The utility of the aldol products has been highlighted with the synthesis of various enantioenriched building blocks and heterocycles, including 1,3&#8208;aminoalcohol, 1,3&#8208;diol, oxetane and isoxazoline derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Approaching the Integer&#8208;Charge Transfer Regime in Molecularly Doped Oligothiophenes by Efficient Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A library of symmetrical linear oligothiophene has been prepared employing decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key transformation. We utilized thiophene potassium carboxylate salts as cross&#8208;coupling partners without the need of co&#8208;catalyst, base, or additives. This method demonstrates complete chemoselectivity and is a comprehensive greener approach compared to the existing methodologies. The modularity of this approach is demonstrated with the preparation of discreet oligothiophenes with up to 10 thiophene repeat units. Symmetrical oligothiophenes represent prototypical organic semiconductors and allow us to spectroscopically assess their response to molecular electrical doping regarding the degree of charge transfer as a function of the chain length. We find evidence that the critical length for integer charge transfer as it is found in the polythiophene limit to be not more than 10 thiophene units, which highlights the potential of long discreet oligothiophenes for their use in organic electronic applications as doped conduction or injection layers.</dc:description>

      <title>A Smart Autocatalytic DNAzyme Biocircuit for in vivo Amplified MicroRNA Imaging</title>

      <title>Semiconducting Polymer Dots with Dual&#8208;Enhanced NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence for Through&#8208;Skull Mouse&#8208;Brain Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular engineering is used to enhance NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence of polymer dots by managing the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects. The polymer dots enabled a remarkable improvement in penetration depth and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in through&#8208;skull and through&#8208;scalp fluorescent imaging of the cerebral vasculature of live mice.







Abstract
Fluorescence probes in the NIR&#8208;IIa region show drastically improved imaging owing to the reduced photon scattering and autofluorescence in biological tissues. Now, NIR&#8208;IIa polymer dots (Pdots) are developed with a dual fluorescence enhancement mechanism. First, the aggregation induced emission of phenothiazine was used to reduce the nonradiative decay pathways of the polymers in condensed states. Second, fluorescence quenching was minimized by different levels of steric hindrance to further boost the fluorescence. The resulting Pdots displayed a fluorescence QY of ca. 1.7&#8201;% in aqueous solution, suggesting an enhancement of ca. 21 times in comparison with the original polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. Small&#8208;animal imaging by using the NIR&#8208;IIa Pdots exhibited a remarkable improvement in penetration depth and signal to background ratio, as confirmed by through&#8208;skull and through&#8208;scalp fluorescent imaging of the cerebral vasculature of live mice.

      <title>Anti&#8208;aromatic vs. induced paratropicity: synthesis and interrogation of a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene with a proton placed directly above the central ring</title>
      <dc:description>We present a high yielding intramolecular oxidative coupling within a diazadioxa[10]helicene to give a dihydro&#8208;diazatrioxa[9]circulene. This is the first [n]circulene containing more the eight ortho annulated rings (n&gt;8).

This distinct environment induces a significant magnetic deshielding effect on that particular proton as determined by  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The origin of the deshielding effect is investigated computationally by NICS values. It is established that the deshielding effect originates from an induced paratropic ring current from the seven aromatic rings of the [9]circulene structure, and not due to the nine&#8208;membered ring being antiaromatic.

      <title>An Oxygen Sensation: Progress in Macromolecule Hydroxylation Triggered by the Elucidation of Cellular Oxygen Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology 2019 was awarded for discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability. This Highlight acknowledges the impact of the laureates&#8217; contributions and summarises the history, molecular aspects, and current challenges of research on how oxygen regulates gene expression. Opportunities for molecular scientists in the field of macromolecule hydroxylation are emphasised.







Abstract
The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine honours three scientists that devoted their careers to pursuing an audacious basic science question: by what mechanisms do animals sense oxygen, and how can cells adapt to a lack of oxygen? The identification of the human hypoxia inducible factor pathway has enabled new approaches for the therapy of related diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, anaemia, and stroke. The intricate molecular details of oxygen sensing broadened interest in the family of iron&#8208; and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases known from elaborate natural product chemistry, and catalysed major progress in macromolecule hydroxylation. The laureates&#8217; work enables numerous avenues for molecular scientists, from C&#8722;H activation chemistry to PROTAC technology, medicinal chemistry, and epigenetics.

      <title>Expanding the Toolbox of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks via Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
The toolbox of metal&#8211;phenolic networks is expanded by enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, where a range of monophenols are converted into catechol&#8208;containing molecules and cross&#8208;linked by metal ions. This strategy preserves functionality of the monophenol precursors, while conferring benefits of catechol&#8208;containing molecules (e.g., universal adhesion) to the networks.







Abstract
Functional coatings are of considerable interest because of their fundamental implications for interfacial assembly and promise for numerous applications. Universally adherent materials have recently emerged as versatile functional coatings; however, such coatings are generally limited to catechol, (ortho&#8208;diphenol)&#8208;containing molecules, as building blocks. Here, we report a facile, biofriendly enzyme&#8208;mediated strategy for assembling a wide range of molecules (e.g., 14 representative molecules in this study) that do not natively have catechol moieties, including small molecules, peptides, and proteins, on various surfaces, while preserving the molecule's inherent function, such as catalysis (&#8776;80&#8201;% retention of enzymatic activity for trypsin). Assembly is achieved by in situ conversion of monophenols into catechols via tyrosinase, where films form on surfaces via covalent and coordination cross&#8208;linking. The resulting coatings are robust, functional (e.g., in protective coatings, biological imaging, and enzymatic catalysis), and versatile for diverse secondary surface&#8208;confined reactions (e.g., biomineralization, metal ion chelation, and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide conjugation).

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Expanding the Toolbox of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks via Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The toolbox of metal&#8211;phenolic networks&lt;/b&gt; is expanded by enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, where a range of monophenols are converted into catechol&#8208;containing molecules and cross&#8208;linked by metal ions. This strategy preserves functionality of the monophenol precursors, while conferring benefits of catechol&#8208;containing molecules (e.g., universal adhesion) to the networks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional coatings are of considerable interest because of their fundamental implications for interfacial assembly and promise for numerous applications. Universally adherent materials have recently emerged as versatile functional coatings; however, such coatings are generally limited to catechol, (&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diphenol)&#8208;containing molecules, as building blocks. Here, we report a facile, biofriendly enzyme&#8208;mediated strategy for assembling a wide range of molecules (e.g., 14 representative molecules in this study) that do not natively have catechol moieties, including small molecules, peptides, and proteins, on various surfaces, while preserving the molecule's inherent function, such as catalysis (&#8776;80&#8201;% retention of enzymatic activity for trypsin). Assembly is achieved by in situ conversion of monophenols into catechols via tyrosinase, where films form on surfaces via covalent and coordination cross&#8208;linking. The resulting coatings are robust, functional (e.g., in protective coatings, biological imaging, and enzymatic catalysis), and versatile for diverse secondary surface&#8208;confined reactions (e.g., biomineralization, metal ion chelation, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide conjugation).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Direct Evidence of Local pH Change and the Role of Alkali Cation during CO2 Electroreduction in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>
Local pH detection: A pH&#8208;dependent electroactive product from the electroreduction of CO2 can be used as a molecular probe, thereby allowing in situ detection of local pH changes during CO2 electroreduction using a rotating ring disc electrode assembly.







Abstract
We report, for the first time, utilizing a rotating ring&#8208;disc electrode (RRDE) assembly for detecting changes in the local pH during aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Using Au as a model catalyst where CO is the only product, we show that the CO oxidation peak shifts by &#8722;86&#177;2&#8197;mV/pH during CO2RR, which can be used to directly quantify the change in the local pH near the catalyst surface during electrolysis. We then applied this methodology to investigate the role of cations in affecting the local pH during CO2RR and find that during CO2RR to CO on Au in an MHCO3 buffer (where M is an alkali metal), the experimentally measured local basicity decreased in the order Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+ &gt; Cs+, which agreed with an earlier theoretical prediction by Singh et&#8197;al. Our results also reveal that the formation of CO is independent of the cation. In summary, RRDE is a versatile tool for detecting local pH change over a diverse range of CO2RR catalysts. Additionally, using the product itself (i.e. CO) as the local pH probe allows us to investigate CO2RR without the interference of additional probe molecules introduced to the system. Most importantly, considering that most CO2RR products have pH&#8208;dependent oxidation, RRDE can be a powerful tool for determining the local pH and correlating the local pH to reaction selectivity.

      <title>Selective Synthesis of Conjugated Chiral Macrocycles: Sidewall Segments of (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;(12,4) Carbon Nanotubes with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

Segments: For the first time, two chiral conjugated macrocycles ([4]CAn2,6), as (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;(12,4) carbon nanotube segments, are synthesized and the physical properties studied. The hoop&#8208;shaped molecules can be directly viewed by an STM technique. Chiral enantiomers with (&#8722;)/(+)&#8197;helicity of the [4]CAn2,6 were successfully isolated.

Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unusual physical properties that are valuable for nanotechnology and electronics, but the chemical synthesis of chirality&#8208; and diameter&#8208;specific CNTs and &#960;&#8208;conjugated CNT segments is still a great challenge. Reported here are the selective syntheses, isolations, characterizations, and photophysical properties of two novel chiral conjugated macrocycles ([4]cyclo&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthracene; [4]CAn2,6), as (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;(12,4) carbon nanotube segments. These conjugated macrocyclic molecules were obtained using a bottom&#8208;up assembly approach and subsequent reductive elimination reaction. The hoop&#8208;shaped molecules can be directly viewed by a STM technique. In addition, chiral enantiomers with (&#8722;)/(+)&#8197;helicity of the [4]CAn2,6 were successfully isolated by HPLC. The new tubular CNT segments exhibit large absorption and photoluminescence redshifts compared to the monomer unit. The carbon enantiomers are also observed to show strong circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.1). The results reported here expand the scope of materials design for bottom&#8208;up synthesis of chiral macrocycles and enrich existing knowledge of their optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Identification of Catalytic Sites for Oxygen Reduction in Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbons with Encapsulated Metal Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
ORR inspiring: With a low&#8208;temperature NH4Cl treatment graphene&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) are etched out of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Removing these metallic NPs greatly enhances the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity allowing the real catalytic centres to be identified.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C materials as efficient non&#8208;precious metal (NPM) catalysts for catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as alternatives to platinum is important for the practical use of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, metal&#8208;N&#8208;C materials have high structural heterogeneity. As a result of their high&#8208;temperature synthesis they often consist of metal&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated metal nanoparticles. Thus it is hard to identify the active structure of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature NH4Cl&#8208;treatment to etch out graphene&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles from metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts without destruction of co&#8208;existing atomically dispersed metal&#8208;Nx sites. Catalytic activity is much enhanced by this selective removal of metallic nanoparticles. Accordingly, we can confirm the spectator role of graphene&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles and the pivotal role of metal&#8208;Nx sites in the metal&#8208;N&#8208;C materials for ORR in the acidic medium.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of a Macrocyclic PROTAC</title>
      <dc:description>
Closing the circle: A macrocyclic PROTAC has been designed and synthesized by adding a cyclizing linker to MZ1, a PROTAC targeting the bromodomain of the BET protein, Brd4. A co&#8208;crystal structure of macroPROTAC&#8208;1 bound in a ternary complex with E3 ligase VHL and the second bromodomain of Brd4 validated the rational design. This macrocyclization strategy enhanced the target specificity and cellular activity of the PROTAC.







Abstract
Constraining a molecule in its bioactive conformation via macrocyclization represents an attractive strategy to rationally design functional chemical probes. While this approach has been applied to enzyme inhibitors or receptor antagonists, to date it remains unprecedented for bifunctional molecules that bring proteins together, such as PROTAC degraders. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a macrocyclic PROTAC by adding a cyclizing linker to the BET degrader MZ1. A co&#8208;crystal structure of macroPROTAC&#8208;1 bound in a ternary complex with VHL and the second bromodomain of Brd4 validated the rational design. Biophysical studies revealed enhanced discrimination between the second and the first bromodomains of BET proteins. Despite a 12&#8208;fold loss of binary binding affinity for Brd4, macroPROTAC&#8208;1 exhibited cellular activity comparable to MZ1. Our findings support macrocyclization as an advantageous strategy to enhance PROTAC degradation potency and selectivity between homologous targets.

      <title>An Engineered Superhydrophilic/Superaerophobic Electrocatalyst Composed of the Supported CoMoSx Chalcogel for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Got to split! A CoMoSx chalcogel was synthesized in situ on nickel foam (NF) to give superhydrophilic/superaerophobic CoMoSx/NF, which served as a highly efficient catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions owing to the enhanced departure of gas bubbles. The overall water splitting device delivered a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.89&#8197;V and maintained its activity without decay for 100&#8197;h.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for large&#8208;scale water splitting is critical but also challenging. In this study, a hierarchical CoMoSx chalcogel was synthesized on a nickel foam (NF) through an in situ metathesis reaction and demonstrated excellent activity and stability in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The high catalytic activity could be ascribed to the abundant active sites/defects in the amorphous framework and promotion of activity through cobalt doping. Furthermore, the superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of micro&#8208;/nanostructured CoMoSx/NF promoted mass transfer by facilitating access of electrolytes and ensuring fast release of gas bubbles. By employing CoMoSx/NF as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the overall water splitting device delivered a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.89&#8197;V and maintained its activity without decay for 100&#8197;h.

      <title>Dual Illumination Enhances Transformation of an Engineered Green&#8208;to&#8208;Red Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein</title>
      <dc:description>
Roadmap to red: LEA, an engineered ancestral GFP&#8208;like protein, could represent a key step for fluorescent proteins to become photoconvertible. Spectroscopic methods, aided by quantum calculations, were used to elucidate an intricate map of light&#8208;induced transformations with trapped species. A new dual&#8208;illumination strategy to enhance the green&#8208;to&#8208;red photoconversion was demonstrated.







Abstract
The molecular mechanisms for the photoconversion of fluorescent proteins remain elusive owing to the challenges of monitoring chromophore structural dynamics during the light&#8208;induced processes. We implemented time&#8208;resolved electronic and stimulated Raman spectroscopies to reveal two hidden species of an engineered ancestral GFP&#8208;like protein LEA, involving semi&#8208;trapped protonated and trapped deprotonated chromophores en&#8197;route to photoconversion in pH&#8197;7.9 buffer. A new dual&#8208;illumination approach was examined, using 400 and 505&#8197;nm light simultaneously to achieve faster conversion and higher color contrast. Substitution of UV irradiation with visible light benefits bioimaging, while the spectral benchmark of a trapped chromophore with characteristic ring twisting and bridge&#8208;H bending motions enables rational design of functional proteins. With the improved H&#8208;bonding network and structural motions, the photoexcited chromophore could increase the photoswitching&#8208;aided photoconversion while reducing trapped species.

      <title>Urine Metabolic Fingerprints Encode Subtypes of Kidney Diseases</title>
      <dc:description>
Metabolic fingerprints of biofluids encode diverse diseases and particularly urine analysis offers complete non&#8208;invasiveness for diagnostics of the future. Plasmonic polymer@Ag is developed for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and sparse&#8208;learning&#8208;based metabolic diagnosis of kidney diseases.

Abstract
Metabolic fingerprints of biofluids encode diverse diseases and particularly urine detection offers complete non&#8208;invasiveness for diagnostics of the future. Present urine detection affords unsatisfactory performance and requires advanced materials to extract molecular information, due to the limited biomarkers and high sample complexity. Herein, we report plasmonic polymer@Ag for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) and sparse&#8208;learning&#8208;based metabolic diagnosis of kidney diseases. Using only 1&#8197;&#956;L of urine without enrichment or purification, polymer@Ag afforded urine metabolic fingerprints (UMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS in seconds. Analysis by sparse learning discriminated lupus nephritis from various other non&#8208;lupus nephropathies and controls. We combined UMFs with urine protein levels (UPLs) and constructed a new diagnostic model to characterize subtypes of kidney diseases. Our work guides urine&#8208;based diagnosis and leads to new personalized analytical tools for other diseases.

      <title>An Ultrasound Activated Vesicle of Janus Au&#8208;MnO Nanoparticles for Promoted Tumor Penetration and Sono&#8208;Chemodynamic Therapy of Orthotopic Liver Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
A smart self&#8208;assembled US/GSH dual&#8208;responsive nanovesicle was synthesized by self&#8208;assembly of Janus Au&#8208;MnO NP. It could be consecutively disassembled into the small Janus Au&#8208;MnO NPs and smaller Au NPs and Mn2+ for dual MRI/PAI&#8208;guided synergistic sono&#8208;chemodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has the advantages of high penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, and it is suitable for deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, there is still a lack of effective sonosensitizers with high sensitivity, safety, and penetration. Now, ultrasound (US) and glutathione (GSH) dual responsive vesicles of Janus Au&#8208;MnO nanoparticles (JNPs) were coated with PEG and a ROS&#8208;sensitive polymer. Upon US irradiation, the vesicles were disassembled into small Janus Au&#8208;MnO nanoparticles (NPs) with promoted penetration ability. Subsequently, GSH&#8208;triggered MnO degradation simultaneously released smaller Au NPs as numerous cavitation nucleation sites and Mn2+ for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), resulting in enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This also allowed dual&#8208;modality photoacoustic imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR) window and T1&#8208;MR imaging due to the released Mn2+, and inhibited orthotopic liver tumor growth via synergistic SDT/CDT.

      <title>Unconventional Route to Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enabled Highly Efficient Electron Extraction and Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The acid treatment of TiO2 weakens the bonding of octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, rendering the formation of amorphous TiO2 buffer layer on the surface of anatase TiO2. This amorphous TiO2 buffer layer contains rich oxygen vacancies, which increase the donor density of TiO2.







Abstract
The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes is an important endeavor toward achieving high&#8208;efficiency solar energy conversion. Now, a simple yet robust acid&#8208;treatment strategy is used to judiciously create an amorphous TiO2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO2 surface as an electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO2 surface. Such amorphous TiO2&#8208;coated ETL possesses an increased electron density owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. Compared to pristine TiO2&#8208;based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid&#8208;treated TiO2 ETL exhibit an enhanced short&#8208;circuit current and power conversion efficiency.

Compared to pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid&#8208;treated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ETL exhibit an enhanced short&#8208;circuit current and power conversion efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Hydroacylation of Unactivated Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Photochemistry: A mild, metal&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute protocol for the direct photochemical hydroacylation of unactivated olefins was developed using phenylglyoxylic acid as the photoinitiator.







Abstract
Direct alkylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds to convert an aldehyde into a ketone is a notorious transformation, due to the laborious challenge of the formation of ketyl or acyl radicals. Herein, we report a green, cheap, metal&#8208;free and efficient method for the hydroacylation of olefins in water. This photochemical protocol utilizes phenylglyoxylic acid, a commercially available small organic molecule, as the photoinitiator, water as the solvent and household fluorescent lamps as the irradiation source, leading to a broad substrate scope of products in moderate to good yields. A wide range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, terminal and non&#8208;terminal alkenes and pharmaceutically relevant molecules can be employed, without the need of directing groups and additives or metal catalysts.

      <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;modified DNA: Topical research trends in this field at the border of bioinorganic chemistry and supramolecular coordination chemistry are identified and highlighted. The Minireview illustrates how ligand&#8208;based nucleoside surrogates have been used to introduce metal ions site&#8208;specifically into double&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;stranded DNA structures.







Abstract
The incorporation of metal ions into nucleic acids by means of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs represents a promising and prominent strategy for the site&#8208;specific decoration of these self&#8208;assembling supramolecules with metal&#8208;based functionality. Over the past 20&#8197;years, numerous nucleoside surrogates have been introduced in this respect, broadening the metal scope by providing perfectly tailored metal&#8208;binding sites. More recently, artificial nucleosides derived from natural purine or pyrimidine bases have moved into the focus of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairing, due to their expected compatibility with regular Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. This minireview summarizes these advances in metal&#8208;mediated base pairing but also includes further recent progress in the field. Moreover, it addresses other aspects of metal&#8208;modified nucleic acids, highlighting an expansion of the concept to metal&#8208;mediated base triples (in triple helices and three&#8208;way junctions) and metal&#8208;mediated base tetrads (in quadruplexes). For all types of metal&#8208;modified nucleic acids, proposed or accomplished applications are briefly mentioned, too.

      <title>Emerging Electron Microscopy Techniques for Probing Functional Interfaces in Energy Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Research on functional interfaces in energy materials should benefit from emerging electron microscopy techniques based on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS). In this Minireview the basic principles behind 4D&#8208;STEM, monochromated EELS, and cryo&#8208;STEM will be introduced and the current state of each will be concisely outlined.







Abstract
Interfaces play a fundamental role in many areas of chemistry. However, their localized nature requires characterization techniques with high spatial resolution in order to fully understand their structure and properties. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art atomic resolution or in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy are indispensable tools for characterizing the local structure and chemistry of materials with single&#8208;atom resolution, but they are not able to measure many properties that dictate function, such as vibrational modes or charge transfer, and are limited to room&#8208;temperature samples containing no liquids. Here, we outline emerging electron microscopy techniques that are allowing these limitations to be overcome and highlight several recent studies that were enabled by these techniques. We then provide a vision for how these techniques can be paired with each other and with in situ methods to deliver new insights into the static and dynamic behavior of functional interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research on functional interfaces&lt;/b&gt; in energy materials should benefit from emerging electron microscopy techniques based on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS). In this Minireview the basic principles behind 4D&#8208;STEM, monochromated EELS, and cryo&#8208;STEM will be introduced and the current state of each will be concisely outlined.

      <title>The Emergence of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
The advantages of being single: Organic semiconducting single crystals are perfect for both fundamental and applied research. This Review discusses recent progress in organic single&#8208;crystal electronics, from fabrication to application.







Abstract
Organic semiconducting single crystals are perfect for both fundamental and application&#8208;oriented research due to the advantages of free grain boundaries, few defects, and minimal traps and impurities, as well as their low&#8208;temperature processability, high flexibility, and low cost. Carrier mobilities of greater than 10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in some organic single crystals indicate a promising application in electronic devices. The progress made, including the molecular structures and fabrication technologies of organic single crystals, is introduced and organic single&#8208;crystal electronic devices, including field&#8208;effect transistors, phototransistors, p&#8208;n heterojunctions, and circuits, are summarized. Organic two&#8208;dimensional single crystals, cocrystals, and large single crystals, together with some potential applications, are introduced. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics, with their challenges and prospects, is also provided.

      <title>&#8220;Design of Experiments&#8221; as a Method to Optimize Dynamic Disulfide Assemblies: Cages and Functionalizable Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>
Eight new macrocycles with reactive functional handles were synthesized through metalloid&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly. &#8220;Design of experiments&#8221; was utilized to optimize reaction conditions for multiple systems to significantly increase the yield of a single, targeted macrocycle.







Abstract
Cyclophanes are a venerable class of macrocyclic and cage compounds that often contain unusual conformations, high strain, and unusual properties. However, synthesis of complex, functional derivatives remains difficult due to low functional group tolerance, high dilution, extreme reaction conditions, and sometimes low yields using traditional stepwise synthetic methods. &#8220;Design of experiments&#8221; (DOE) is a method employed for the optimization of reaction conditions, and we showcase this approach to generate a dramatic increase in the yield of specific targets from two different self&#8208;assembling systems. These examples demonstrate that DOE provides an additional tool in tuning self&#8208;assembling, dynamic covalent systems.

      <title>Water Purification and Microplastics Removal Using Magnetic Polyoxometalate&#8208;Supported Ionic Liquid Phases (magPOM&#8208;SILPs)</title>
      <dc:description>
Clean machine: A three&#8208;component composite allows the magnetic removal of organic, inorganic, microbial, and microplastic pollutants from water. Magnetic Fe2O3/SiO2 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles are functionalized with a polyoxometalate ionic liquid. The composite can be dispersed in water, binds multiple pollutants and can be fully recovered with a permanent magnet.







Abstract
Filtration is an established water&#8208;purification technology. However, due to low flow rates, the filtration of large volumes of water is often not practical. Herein, we report an alternative purification approach in which a magnetic nanoparticle composite is used to remove organic, inorganic, microbial, and microplastics pollutants from water. The composite is based on a polyoxometalate ionic liquid (POM&#8208;IL) adsorbed onto magnetic microporous core&#8211;shell Fe2O3/SiO2 particles, giving a magnetic POM&#8208;supported ionic liquid phase (magPOM&#8208;SILP). Efficient, often quantitative removal of several typical surface water pollutants is reported together with facile removal of the particles using a permanent magnet. Tuning of the composite components could lead to new materials for centralized and decentralized water purification systems.

Trypanosoma parasites cause two key neglected tropical diseases, currently affecting over 8 million people.

Abstract
Trypanosoma protozoan parasites are the causative agents of Chagas disease and sleeping sickness, two neglected tropical diseases where there is an urgent need for improved treatments and the evaluation of promising drug leads like the actinoallolides. Enabled by the highly stereocontrolled aldol reactions of three chiral ketone building blocks, an efficient first total synthesis of the potent anti&#8208;trypanosomal macrolide (+)&#8208;actinoallolide&#8197;A has been achieved in 17 steps and 8&#8201;% overall yield. Our convergent route features an adventurous ring&#8208;closing metathesis to form the requisite trisubstituted (8E)&#8208;alkene in the 12&#8208;membered macrolactone, followed by the controlled installation of the labile transannular hemiacetal. Late&#8208;stage diversification then provides ready access to the congeneric (+)&#8208;actinoallolides&#8197;B&#8211;E.

      <title>N&#8208;Confused Phlorin&#8208;Prodigiosin Chimera: meso&#8208;Aryl Oxidation and &#960;&#8208;Extension Triggered by Peripheral Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>
On the periphery: Peripheral coordination of PdII and BF2 with N&#8208;confused phlorin&#8208;prodigiosin chimera triggered unique reactions in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). In the case of PdII, the meso&#8208;phenyl group undergoes oxidation and in the case of BF2, there is &#960;&#8197;extension through a N,N&#8208;diethylaminovinyl group.







Abstract
An N&#8208;confused phlorin isomer bearing a dipyrrin moiety at the &#945;&#8208;position of the confused pyrrole ring (1) was synthesized. PdII and BIII coordination at the peripheral prodigiosin&#8208;like moiety of 1 afforded the corresponding complexes 2 and 3. Reflux of 2 in triethylamine (TEA) converted the meso&#8208;phenyl into the PdII&#8208;coordinating phenoxy group to afford 4. Under the same reaction conditions, TEA was linked to the &#945;&#8208;position of the dipyrrin unit in 3 as an N,N&#8208;diethylaminovinyl group to afford 5. Furthermore, peripheral coordination of BIII in 3 and 5 improved the planarity of the phlorin macrocycle and thus facilitated the coordination of AgIII at the inner cavity to afford 3&#8208;Ag and 5&#8208;Ag, respectively. These results provide an effective approach for developing unique porphyrinoids through peripheral coordination.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On the periphery&lt;/b&gt;: Peripheral coordination of Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with N&#8208;confused phlorin&#8208;prodigiosin chimera triggered unique reactions in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). In the case of Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenyl group undergoes oxidation and in the case of BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is &#960;&#8197;extension through a N,N&#8208;diethylaminovinyl group.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An N&#8208;confused phlorin isomer bearing a dipyrrin moiety at the &#945;&#8208;position of the confused pyrrole ring (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized. Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; coordination at the peripheral prodigiosin&#8208;like moiety of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; afforded the corresponding complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. Reflux of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in triethylamine (TEA) converted the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenyl into the Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinating phenoxy group to afford &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Under the same reaction conditions, TEA was linked to the &#945;&#8208;position of the dipyrrin unit in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; as an N,N&#8208;diethylaminovinyl group to afford &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Furthermore, peripheral coordination of B&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; improved the planarity of the phlorin macrocycle and thus facilitated the coordination of Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; at the inner cavity to afford &lt;b&gt;3&#8208;Ag&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&#8208;Ag&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. These results provide an effective approach for developing unique porphyrinoids through peripheral coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Critical Role of Reductive Steps in the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis and Hydrolysis of Aryl Ether C&#8722;O Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
In water or in decalin: The significant deuterium kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD=5.7) of the hydrogenolysis of diphenyl ether on nickel and the positive dependence of the rate on the H2 chemical potential point to a mechanism in which cleavage of the aromatic ether bond proceeds in a concerted fashion with ipso&#8208;H addition to the phenyl ring.







Abstract
The hydrogenolysis of the aromatic C&#8722;O bond in aryl ethers catalyzed by Ni was studied in decalin and water. Observations of a significant kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD=5.7) for the reactions of diphenyl ether under H2 and D2 atmosphere and a positive dependence of the rate on H2 chemical potential in decalin indicate that addition of H to the aromatic ring is involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step. All kinetic evidence points to the fact that H&#8197;addition occurs concerted with C&#8722;O bond scission. DFT calculations also suggest a route consistent with these observations involving hydrogen atom addition to the ipso position of the phenyl ring concerted with C&#8722;O scission. Hydrogenolysis initiated by H addition in water is more selective (ca. 75&#8201;%) than reactions in decalin (ca. 30&#8201;%).

      <title>Efficient Organocatalytic Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane</title>
      <dc:description>
H2 go: Efficient dehydrogenation of ammonia borane by the organic catalyst 6&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;thiopyridone is described. Mechanistic investigations show that the reaction commences with dehydrogenative S&#8722;B coupling. An inorganic retro&#8208;ene reaction closes the catalytic cycle and regenerates the catalyst.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of ammonia borane by sterically encumbered pyridones as organocatalysts is reported. With 6&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;thiopyridone as the catalyst, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 88&#8197;h&#8722;1 was achieved. Experimental mechanistic investigations, substantiated by DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) computations, indicate a mechanistic scenario that commences with the protonation of a B&#8722;H bond by the mercaptopyridine form of the catalyst. The reactive intermediate formed by this initial protonation was observed by NMR spectroscopy and the molecular structure of a surrogate determined by SCXRD. An intramolecular proton transfer in this intermediate from the NH3 group to the pyridine ring with concomitant breaking of the S&#8722;B bond regenerates the thiopyridone and closes the catalytic cycle. This step can be described as an inorganic retro&#8208;ene reaction.

SiR, the NMe has surrendered: Benzylic ammonium salts can be transformed into the corresponding silanes by a copper&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;type displacement. The enantioenrichment of the precursors is completely retained in the &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of benzylsilanes starting from the corresponding ammonium triflates is reported. Silyl boronic esters are employed as silicon pronucleophiles, and the reaction is catalyzed by copper(I) salts. Enantioenriched benzylic ammonium salts react stereospecifically through an SN2&#8208;type displacement of the ammonium group to afford &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes with inversion of the configuration. A cyclopropyl&#8208;substituted substrate does not undergo ring opening, thus suggesting an ionic reaction mechanism with no benzyl radical intermediate.

      <title>Detecting Counterion Dynamics in DNA&#8211;Protein Association</title>
      <dc:description>
Ion atmosphere: The condensation of cations around DNA and their release upon DNA&#8211;protein association have been proposed to contribute to binding thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize the ion atmosphere around DNA and directly detect the release of cations upon DNA&#8211;protein association. This release is observed as an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient Dapp of cations.







Abstract
Due to a high density of negative charges on its surface, DNA condenses cations as counterions, forming the so&#8208;called &#8220;ion atmosphere&#8221;. Although the release of counterions upon DNA&#8211;protein association has been postulated to have a major contribution to the binding thermodynamics, this release remains to be confirmed through a direct observation of the ions.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Detecting Counterion Dynamics in DNA&#8211;Protein Association"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ion atmosphere&lt;/b&gt;: The condensation of cations around DNA and their release upon DNA&#8211;protein association have been proposed to contribute to binding thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize the ion atmosphere around DNA and directly detect the release of cations upon DNA&#8211;protein association. This release is observed as an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;app&lt;/sub&gt; of cations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a high density of negative charges on its surface, DNA condenses cations as counterions, forming the so&#8208;called &#8220;ion atmosphere&#8221;. Although the release of counterions upon DNA&#8211;protein association has been postulated to have a major contribution to the binding thermodynamics, this release remains to be confirmed through a direct observation of the ions. Herein, we report the characterization of the ion atmosphere around DNA using NMR spectroscopy and directly detect the release of counterions upon DNA&#8211;protein association. NMR&#8208;based diffusion data reveal the highly dynamic nature of counterions within the ion atmosphere around DNA. Counterion release is observed as an increase in the apparent ionic diffusion coefficient, which directly provides the number of counterions released upon DNA&#8211;protein association.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deciphering an Abnormal Layered&#8208;Tunnel Heterostructure Induced by Chemical Substitution for the Sodium Oxide Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>
An abnormal layered&#8208;tunnel heterostructure Na0.44Co0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode material induced by chemical element substitution is described. The crystal&#8208;structure engineering strategy that was used gives an outlook into high&#8208;performance sodium ion batteries.







Abstract
Demands for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems have driven the development of layered transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes for room&#8208;temperature rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Now, an abnormal layered&#8208;tunnel heterostructure Na0.44Co0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode material induced by chemical element substitution is reported. By virtue of beneficial synergistic effects, this layered&#8208;tunnel electrode shows outstanding electrochemical performance in sodium half&#8208;cell system and excellent compatibility with hard carbon anode in sodium full&#8208;cell system. The underlying formation process, charge compensation mechanism, phase transition, and sodium&#8208;ion storage electrochemistry are clearly articulated and confirmed through combined analyses of in&#8197;situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as operando X&#8208;ray diffraction. This crystal structure engineering regulation strategy offers a future outlook into advanced cathode materials for SIBs.

      <title>Yttrium&#8208;86 Is a Positron Emitting Surrogate of Gadolinium for Noninvasive Quantification of Whole&#8208;Body Distribution of Gadolinium&#8208;Based Contrast Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Yttrium&#8208;86 PET imaging can inform on the clearance and biodistribution of the gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents used in MRI. Trace amounts of contrast agent can be detected in kidney 48&#8197;h post injection in rodents.







Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used to provide diagnostic information in clinical magnetic resonance (MR) examinations. Gadolinium (Gd) has been detected in the brain, bone and skin of patients, months and years following GBCA administration, raising concerns about long term toxicity. Despite increased scrutiny, the concentration, chemical form and fate of the retained gadolinium species remain unknown. Importantly, the whole body biodistribution and organ clearance of GBCAs is poorly understood in humans. Gadolinium lacks suitable isotopes for nuclear imaging. We demonstrate that the yttrium&#8208;86 isotope can be used as a gadolinium surrogate. We show that Gd and their analogous Y complexes have similar properties both in solution and in vivo, and that yttrium&#8208;86 PET can be used to track the biodistribution of GBCAs over a two&#8208;day period.

      <title>Online Monitoring of Electrochemical Carbon Corrosion in Alkaline Electrolytes by Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>
Caught in the act: Direct detection of CO2 as a marker for carbon oxidation in alkaline electrolytes is now possible using a novel DEMS cell (DEMS=differential electrochemical mass spectrometry) and a specially designed experimental procedure. A high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst loading on carbon suppresses carbon corrosion in alkaline media.







Abstract
Carbon corrosion at high anodic potentials is a major source of instability, especially in acidic electrolytes and impairs the long&#8208;term functionality of electrodes. In&#8208;depth investigation of carbon corrosion in alkaline environment by means of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) is prevented by the conversion of CO2 into CO32&#8722;. We report the adaptation of a DEMS system for online CO2 detection as the product of carbon corrosion in alkaline electrolytes. A new cell design allows for in&#8197;situ acidification of the electrolyte to release initially dissolved CO32&#8722; as CO2 in front of the DEMS membrane and its subsequent detection by mass spectrometry. DEMS studies of a carbon&#8208;supported nickel boride (NixB/C) catalyst and Vulcan XC 72 at high anodic potentials suggest protection of carbon in the presence of highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Most importantly, carbon corrosion is decreased in alkaline solution.

      <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Diffusion Barriers in Pt/Beta Zeolite Catalyzed Isomerization of n&#8208;Heptane</title>
      <dc:description>
Diffusion barriers on interfaces: There exist very strong internal diffusion barriers in Beta zeolites, which subsequently reduce their activity and selectivity in catalyzing the isomerization of n&#8208;heptane. The Beta zeolite with no observable internal interfaces (see picture) can be 180&#8201;% higher in activity and 22&#8201;% higher in selectivity.







Abstract
Applications of zeolites in catalysis are plagued by strong diffusion resistance, which results from limitations to molecular transport in micropores, across external crystal surfaces, but also across internal interfaces. The first type of diffusion resistance is well understood, the second is receiving increasing attention, while the diffusion barriers at internal interfaces remain largely unclear. We take Pt/Beta catalyzed isomerization of n&#8208;heptane as the model system to explore the role of internal diffusion barriers in zeolite catalysis. The two as&#8208;synthesized Pt/Beta catalysts have an identical Pt loading, similar Beta particle size and acidity, but different internal structures. A Pt/Beta crystal with no observable internal interfaces can be 180&#8201;% higher in activity and 22&#8201;% higher in selectivity than its counterpart with numerous internal interfaces. This can only be attributed to the strong transport barriers across internal interfaces, as supported by directly comparing the apparent diffusivities of the two Beta samples.

      <title>Injury&#8208;Triggered Blueing Reactions of Psilocybe &#8220;Magic&#8221; Mushrooms</title>
      <dc:description>
Magic mushroom blues: Hallucinogenic Psilocybe mushrooms turn blue when injured. We report that the phosphatase PsiP and the laccase PsiL degrade psilocybin and initiate blueing. MALDI&#8208;MS and in situ NMR spectroscopy show that the blue color is due to a mixture of quinoid psilocyl oligomers, primarily coupled via carbon 5.







Abstract
Upon injury, psychotropic psilocybin&#8208;producing mushrooms instantly develop an intense blue color, the chemical basis and mode of formation of which has remained elusive. We report two enzymes from Psilocybe cubensis that carry out a two&#8208;step cascade to prepare psilocybin for oxidative oligomerization that leads to blue products. The phosphatase PsiP removes the 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphate group to yield psilocin, while PsiL oxidizes its 4&#8208;hydroxy group. The PsiL reaction was monitored by in&#8197;situ 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, which indicated that oxidative coupling of psilocyl residues occurs primarily via C&#8208;5. MS and IR spectroscopy indicated the formation of a heterogeneous mixture of preferentially psilocyl 3&#8208; to 13&#8208;mers and suggest multiple oligomerization routes, depending on oxidative power and substrate concentration. The results also imply that phosphate ester of psilocybin serves a reversible protective function.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Injury&#8208;Triggered Blueing Reactions of Psilocybe &#8220;Magic&#8221; Mushrooms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magic mushroom blues&lt;/b&gt;: Hallucinogenic &lt;i&gt;Psilocybe&lt;/i&gt; mushrooms turn blue when injured. We report that the phosphatase PsiP and the laccase PsiL degrade psilocybin and initiate blueing. MALDI&#8208;MS and in situ NMR spectroscopy show that the blue color is due to a mixture of quinoid psilocyl oligomers, primarily coupled via carbon 5.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon injury, psychotropic psilocybin&#8208;producing mushrooms instantly develop an intense blue color, the chemical basis and mode of formation of which has remained elusive. We report two enzymes from &lt;i&gt;Psilocybe cubensis&lt;/i&gt; that carry out a two&#8208;step cascade to prepare psilocybin for oxidative oligomerization that leads to blue products. The phosphatase PsiP removes the 4&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phosphate group to yield psilocin, while PsiL oxidizes its 4&#8208;hydroxy group. The PsiL reaction was monitored by in&#8197;situ &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, which indicated that oxidative coupling of psilocyl residues occurs primarily via C&#8208;5. MS and IR spectroscopy indicated the formation of a heterogeneous mixture of preferentially psilocyl 3&#8208; to 13&#8208;mers and suggest multiple oligomerization routes, depending on oxidative power and substrate concentration. The results also imply that phosphate ester of psilocybin serves a reversible protective function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold(III) &#960;&#8208;Allyl Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Go for gold: The &#960; coordination of allyl moieties to (P,C) coordinated gold(III) has been authenticated and shown to promote nucleophilic addition. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses combined with detailed DFT calculations support tight quasi&#8208;symmetric &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the allyl moiety.







Abstract
Gold(III) &#960;&#8208;complexes have been authenticated recently with alkenes, alkynes, and arenes. The key importance of PdII &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes in organometallic chemistry (Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction) prompted us to explore gold(III) &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes, which have remained elusive so far. The (P,C)AuIII(allyl) and (methallyl) complexes 3 and 3&#8242; were readily prepared and isolated as thermally and air&#8208;stable solids. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses combined with detailed DFT calculations support tight quasi&#8208;symmetric &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the allyl moiety. The &#960;&#8208;allyl gold(III) complexes are activated towards nucleophilic additions, as substantiated with &#946;&#8208;diketo enolates.

      <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Cymoside through a Bioinspired Oxidative Cyclization of a Strictosidine Derivative</title>
      <dc:description>
A bioinspired oxidative cascade cyclization enabled the first total synthesis of cymoside, a monoterpene indole alkaloid which possesses a unique furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoline&#8208;containing hexacyclic&#8208;fused skeleton.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the caged monoterpene indole alkaloid cymoside is reported. This natural product displays a unique hexacyclic&#8208;fused skeleton whose biosynthesis implies an early oxidative cyclization of strictosidine. Our approach to the furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoline framework relied on an unprecedented biomimetic sequence which started by the diastereoselective oxidation of the indole ring into a hydroxyindolenine which triggered the addition of an enol ether and was followed by the trapping of an oxocarbenium intermediate.

      <title>Steric Mixed&#8208;Cation 2D Perovskite as a Methylammonium Locker to Stabilize MAPbI3</title>
      <dc:description>
Locked up: The steric PTA&#8208;MA mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite of PTAMAPbI4 is demonstrated as an effective methylammonium (MA) cation locker to stabilize MAPbI3 by steric effect of the phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA) cation. This MA cation locked MAPbI3 based perovskite exhibited significantly enhanced stability and photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The reduced dimension perovskite including 2D perovskites are one of the most promising strategies to stabilize lead halide perovskite. A mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite based on a steric phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA) cation is presented. The PTA&#8208;MA mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite of PTAMAPbI4 can be formed on the surface of MAPbI3 (PTAI&#8208;MAPbI3) by controllable PTAI intercalation by either spin coating or soaking. The PTAMAPbI4 capping layer can not only passivate PTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 perovskite but also act as MA+ locker to inhibit MAI extraction and significantly enhance the stability. The highly stable PTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 based perovskite solar cells exhibit a reproducible photovoltaic performance with a champion PCE of 21.16&#8201;%. Such unencapsulated devices retain 93&#8201;% of initial efficiency after 500&#8197;h continuous illumination. This steric mixed&#8208;cation 2D perovskite as MA+ locker to stabilize the MAPbI3 is a promising strategy to design stable and high&#8208;performance hybrid lead halide perovskites.

      <title>Fluorous Corannulenes: Ab initio Predictions and the Synthesis of sym&#8208;Pentafluorocorannulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Aromatic hydrocarbons and their fluorous counterparts provide a duality of structurally similar yet physically distinct compound classes. Efficient penta&#8208;substitution of pinacol borates by fluoride led to the first synthesis of pentafluorocorannulene.







Abstract
Ten sym&#8208;penta and deca&#8208;X substituted corannulenes (1&#8211;10; X=H, F, CH3, or CF3) define a library of fluorous compounds comprising high symmetry non&#8208;planar aromatic compunds. They provide a group of structurally similar, yet physically distinct structures manifesting special chemical behavior related to their degree of fluorination. Owing to their bowl forms, corannulene derivatives are distinct from planar polynuclear aromatic compounds; they have relatively high dipole moments, accept 1&#8211;4 electrons, and display room temperature fluorescence as well as low temp phosphorescence. Electronic structure theory predicts the bowl inversion barrier and physical properties. The syntheses of sym&#8208;pentafluorocorannulene by an efficient late stage fluorination affords a key derivative to calibrate predictions.

      <title>Construction of Chiral 2,3&#8208;Allenols through a Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Direct Alkynylogous Aldol Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Two by two: A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric direct alkynylogous aldol reaction was developed that delivers chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols with good to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.

Abstract
Chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols were constructed through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric direct alkynylogous aldol reaction. With aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes, the alkynylogous aldol reaction with (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS as the ligand proceeded smoothly to furnish the products in excellent regioselectivity with good to high diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. In the cases of aliphatic aldehydes, esters of but&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol as the substrates and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE as the ligand were found to be crucial to get good to high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The produced chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols are easily transformed into synthetically useful 2&#8208;furanones through cyclization. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied in the rapid synthesis of two chiral intermediates toward the synthesis of two pharmaceutically active compounds that have been proposed for the treatment of neurological disorders.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols were constructed through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric direct alkynylogous aldol reaction. With aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes, the alkynylogous aldol reaction with (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS as the ligand proceeded smoothly to furnish the products in excellent regioselectivity with good to high diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. In the cases of aliphatic aldehydes, esters of but&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol as the substrates and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE as the ligand were found to be crucial to get good to high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The produced chiral 2,3&#8208;allenols are easily transformed into synthetically useful 2&#8208;furanones through cyclization. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied in the rapid synthesis of two chiral intermediates toward the synthesis of two pharmaceutically active compounds that have been proposed for the treatment of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Triazole&#8208;Substituted Aryl Iodide with Omnipotent Reactivity in Enantioselective Oxidations
</title>
      <dc:description>
A good all&#8208;rounder: An easy to synthesize chiral triazole&#8208;substituted aryl iodide is described as an omnipotent catalyst for a variety of iodane&#8208;mediated enantioselective oxidations. It outperforms all existing chiral hypervalent iodine precursors.







Abstract
A widely applicable triazole&#8208;substituted chiral aryl iodide is described as catalyst for enantioselective oxidation reactions. The introduction of a substituent in ortho&#8208;position to the iodide is key for its high reactivity and selectivity. Besides a robust and modular synthesis, the main advantage of this catalyst is the excellent performance in a plethora of mechanistically diverse enantioselective transformations, such as spirocyclizations, phenol dearomatizations, &#945;&#8208;oxygenations, and oxidative rearrangements. DFT&#8208;calculations of in&#8197;situ generated [hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]arene isomers give an initial rational for the observed reactivity.

      <title>An Exceptionally Stable and Scalable Sugar&#8211;Polyolefin Frank&#8211;Kasper A15 Phase</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular truffles: A readily accessible one&#8208;component sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugate is presented that quantitatively produces an exceptionally stable thermotropic soft matter Frank&#8211;Kasper A15 phase through a rapid and irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transition.







Abstract
&#8220;One&#8208;component&#8221; soft material Frank&#8211;Kasper (FK) phases are an intriguing structural form of matter that possess periodically ordered structures arising from the self&#8208;reconfiguration and close packing of an initial assembly of identical &#8220;deformable&#8221; spheres into two or more size&#8208; or shape&#8208;distinct sets of particles. Significant challenges that must still be addressed to advance the field of soft matter FK phases further, however, include their rare and unpredictable occurrence, uncertain mechanisms of solid&#8208;state assembly, and low thermodynamic stability. Here we show that a readily&#8208;accessible sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugate quantitatively produces an exceptionally stable solid&#8208;state FK A15 phase through a rapid and irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transition, which contrary to other prevailing proposed mechanisms, does not require mass transfer between particles or large structural reorganization in the bulk to establish unit cell non&#8208;equivalency. Our results provide the basis for a realistic strategy for obtaining practical and scalable quantities of a diverse range of sugar&#8211;polyolefin FK A15 phases with unique intrinsic physical properties and chemical reactivities not previously seen in such systems.

      <title>The Cytotoxic Natural Product Vioprolide&#8197;A Targets Nucleolar Protein 14, Which Is Essential for Ribosome Biogenesis</title>
      <dc:description>
On target: Functional characterization of VioA revealed potent growth inhibitory effects in cancer cells and remarkable apoptosis induction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, without affecting healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thermal proteome profiling studies revealed nucleolar protein 14 (NOP14) as a protein target, which was further validated using proteomics and biological follow&#8208;up experiments.







Abstract
Novel targets are needed for treatment of devastating diseases such as cancer. For decades, natural products have guided innovative therapies by addressing diverse pathways. Inspired by the potent cytotoxic bioactivity of myxobacterial vioprolides&#8197;A&#8211;D, we performed in&#8208;depth studies on their mode of action. Based on its prominent potency against human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, we conducted thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and deciphered the target proteins of the most active derivative vioprolide&#8197;A (VioA) in Jurkat cells. Nucleolar protein 14 (NOP14), which is essential in ribosome biogenesis, was confirmed as a specific target of VioA by a suite of proteomic and biological follow&#8208;up experiments. Given its activity against ALL cells compared to healthy lymphocytes, VioA exhibits unique therapeutic potential for anticancer therapy through a novel mode of action.

      <title>A Flexible Method for Covalent Double Functionalization of Graphene Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Accessorizing: A versatile method for the chemoselective double functionalization of graphene oxide has been developed. The method involves epoxide ring opening by a protected aminoethanethiol, and subsequent reaction of the hydroxy groups with benzoquinone followed by Michael addition of an amine derivative.







Abstract
A method for the double functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) under mild alkaline conditions has been developed. Two functional groups were covalently linked to GO in two steps: the first group was attached by an epoxide ring&#8208;opening reaction and the second, bearing an amine function, was covalently conjugated to benzoquinone attached to the GO. The doubly functionalized GO was characterized by several techniques, confirming the sequential covalent modification of the GO surface with two different functional groups. This method is straightforward and the reaction conditions are mild, allowing preservation of the structure and properties of GO. This strategy could be exploited to prepare multifunctional GO conjugates with potential applications in many fields ranging from materials science to biomedicine.

The combination of a gold catalyst and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) in the same solution for relay reactions is disclosed. The ynamide substrate is activated by the gold catalyst to form an intermediate that subsequently reacts with the enals to form bicyclic &#948;&#8208;lactam products with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The combined use of gold as transition metal catalyst and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organic catalyst in the same solution for relay catalytic reactions was disclosed. The ynamide substrate was activated by gold catalyst to form unsaturated ketimine intermediate that subsequently reacted with the enals (via azolium enolate intermediate generated with NHC) effectively to form bicyclic lactam products with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivities. The gold and NHC coordination and dissociation can be dynamic and tunable events, and thus allow the co&#8208;existence of both active metal and carbene organic catalysts in appreciable concentrations, for the dual catalytic reaction to proceed.

      <title>Pyridine/Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Helical Foldamer Ion Channels with Exceptionally High K+/Na+ Selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Return to the fold: Aromatic foldamer helical channels were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot polymerization strategy using various amide&#8208;coupling agents. Channels up to 2.7&#8197;nm in length were created. The 3&#8197;&#197; wide and electron&#8208;rich cavity of the channels exhibits highly active and exceptionally selective transport of K+ ions, with a K+/Na+ selectivity of as much as 16.3 achieved by channels with an average length of 2.3&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Protein channels are characterized by high transport selectivity, which is essential for maintaining cellular function. Efforts to reproduce such high selectivity over the past four decades have not been very successful. We report a novel series of aromatic foldamer&#8208;based polymeric channels where the backbone is stabilized by differential electrostatic repulsions among heteroatoms helically arrayed along the helical backbone. Nanotubes averaging 2.3 and 2.7&#8197;nm in length mediate highly efficient transport of K+ ions as a consequence of hydrophilic electron&#8208;rich hollow cavities that are 3&#8197;&#197; in diameter. Exceptionally high K+ and Na+ selectivity values of 16.3 and 12.6, respectively, are achieved.

      <title>A Novel Approach to Functionalization of Aryl Azides through the Generation and Reaction of Organolithium Species Bearing Masked Azides in Flow Microreactors</title>
      <dc:description>
Beneath the mask: A novel and straightforward method for synthesizing aryl azides bearing a variety of functional groups by using a flow microreactor system was developed. This strategy is based on the generation and reaction of aryllithium species bearing a triazene as a masked azide group.







Abstract
A novel straightforward method for aryl azides having functional groups based on generation and reactions of aryllithiums bearing a triazene group from polybromoarenes using flow microreactor systems was achieved. The present approach will serve as a powerful method in organolithium chemistry and open a new possibility in the synthesis of polyfunctional organic azides.

      <title>Towards Long&#8208;Term Photostability of Novel Nickel Hydroxide/BiVO4 Photoanodes via in&#8208;situ Catalyst Tuning</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing long&#8208;term photostability of BiVO  4  photoanode is an important issue for solar water splitting, NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) has a fast water oxidation kinetics compared to FeOOH OEC.&#160; However, it generally shows a relatively lower photoresponse and poor stability compared to FeOOH due to the more substantial interface recombination at the NiOOH/ BiVO  4  junction. In this work, we utilize a feasible plasma etching approach to reduce both interface/surface recombination at NiOOH/ BiVO  4  and NiOOH/electrolyte junctions. Further, adding Fe  2+  into the borate buffer electrolyte alleviates the active but unstable character of etched&#8208;NiOOH/BiVO  4  , leading to an outstanding oxygen evolution over 200 h. The improved charge transfer and photostability can be attributed to the active defects and a mixture of NiOOH/NiO/Ni in OEC induced by plasma etching treatment. Metallic Ni acts as the ion source for the in&#8208;situ generation of the NiFe OEC over long&#8208;term durability.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing long&#8208;term photostability of BiVO  4  photoanode is an important issue for solar water splitting, NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) has a fast water oxidation kinetics compared to FeOOH OEC.&#160; However, it generally shows a relatively lower photoresponse and poor stability compared to FeOOH due to the more substantial interface recombination at the NiOOH/ BiVO  4  junction. In this work, we utilize a feasible plasma etching approach to reduce both interface/surface recombination at NiOOH/ BiVO  4  and NiOOH/electrolyte junctions. Further, adding Fe  2+  into the borate buffer electrolyte alleviates the active but unstable character of etched&#8208;NiOOH/BiVO  4  , leading to an outstanding oxygen evolution over 200 h. The improved charge transfer and photostability can be attributed to the active defects and a mixture of NiOOH/NiO/Ni in OEC induced by plasma etching treatment. Metallic Ni acts as the ion source for the in&#8208;situ generation of the NiFe OEC over long&#8208;term durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of Anisotropic ZnSe Nanorods with Zinc&#8208;Blende Crystal Structure</title>
      <dc:description>Compared with the well explored cadmium based one&#8208;dimensional nanorods (NRs), it is still a big challenge to produce heavy&#8208;metal free II&#8208;VI semiconductor analogues with a controlled size, shape and crystal structure. Herein, we report a synthetic strategy towards ZnSe NRs with a zinc&#8208;blende crystal structure, where use of the anisotropic nuclei produced via a high temperature selenium injection favors anisotropic growth. Elongated ZnSe NRs were produced from anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, while spherical ZnSe nanocrystals were obtained starting from isotropic nuclei. The different free energy at (111) and (220) planes in anisotropic ZnSe nuclei induces the anisotropic growth for ZnSe NRs along &lt;111&gt; direction. Proper choice of the capping ligand (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) has an important implication for the formation of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei, and has also allowed us to control the diameter of the final ZnSe NRs via limiting the growth of the (220) crystal plane of anisotropic ZnSe nuclei.</dc:description>

      <title>Emerging Cubic Chirality in &#947;CD&#8208;MOF for Fabricating Circularly Polarized Luminescent Crystalline Materials and Size Effect</title>
      <dc:description>As an important chiral MOFs, the chiral feature of &#947;CD&#8208;MOF, especially the emergent cubic void was not unveiled so far. Herein, through the host&#8208;guest interaction between &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and achiral luminophores with different charges and sizes, we revealed the unique cubic chirality of the emerging void in &#947;CD&#8208;MOF as well as a size effect on CPL induction for the first time. Numerous achiral luminophores could be integrated into &#947;CD&#8208;MOF and emitted significantly boosted circularly polarized luminescence. While the small sized luminophores preferred to be loaded into the intrinsic void of &#947;CD, the large ones were selectively encapsulated into the cubic void. Interestingly, when the size of the guest luminophores was close to the cubic size, it showed determined and strong negative CPL. Otherwise, either positive or negative CPL was induced.

      <title>C&#8208;C bond formation in syngas conversion over Zn sites grafted on ZSM&#8208;5</title>
      <dc:description>Despite significant progress achieved in Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) technology, the selectivity control remains a challenge in syngas conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that zinc ion&#8208;exchanged ZSM&#8208;5 steers syngas conversion toward ethane with a selectivity in hydrocarbons (excluding CO  2  ) reaching as high as 87% at 20% CO conversion. NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray fluorescence indicate that the selective pathway toward ethane is likely attributed to the Zn sites grafted within the ZSM&#8208;5 pores.  Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ  solid state NMR detects C  2  species of acetyl [&#8208;COCH  3  ] bonding with an oxygen, ethyl [&#8208;CH  2  CH  3  ] bonding with a Zn site, and epoxyethane molecules adsorbing on a Zn site and a Br&#248;nsted acid site of the catalyst, respectively. These could provide some insights to C&#8208;C bond formation during ethane formation. Interestingly, this selective reaction pathway toward ethane appears to be general, because a series of other Zn  2+  ion&#8208;exchanged aluminosilicate zeolites with different topologies e.g. SSZ&#8208;13, MCM&#8208;22, ZSM&#8208;12 all give predominantly ethane. By contrast, a physical mixture of ZnO&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 favors formation of hydrocarbons beyond C  3+  . These results provide an important guidance for tuning the product selectivity in syngas conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmable Assembly of Nano&#8208;architectures through Designing Anisotropic DNA Origami Patches</title>
      <dc:description>Programmable assembly of nanoparticles towards well&#8208;defined architectures has attracted much attention due to their tailored properties resulted from coupling effects. However, ways to develop general and precise approaches to control the binding modes between nanoparticles (NPs) when fabricating designed architectures remain a significant challenge due to the difficulty in manipulating the accurate positions of the functional patches on the surface of NPs. Here, we develop a strategy to encage spherical NPs into pre&#8208;designed octahedral DNA origami frames (DOFs) through DNA base&#8208;pairings. The DOFs logically define the arrangements of functional patches in three dimensions, due to the programmability of DNA hybridization, and thus control the binding modes of the &#8220;caged&#8221; nanoparticle with designed anisotropy. By applying the node&#8208;and&#8208;spacer approach, which was widely used in crystal engineering to design coordination polymers, we are able to rationally design patchy NPs with lower symmetry encoded to assemble a series of nano&#8208;architectures with high&#8208;order geometries.</dc:description>

The CAAC analogue of Thiele's hydrocarbon has a singlet ground state, whereas the CAAC analogue of Schlenk's hydrocarbon contains two unpaired electrons.

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Enzyme as Efficient Multiple Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Scavenger for Sepsis Management</title>
      <dc:description>Sepsis, characterized by immoderate production of multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), continues to cause high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the progress made with nanozymes, the efficient antioxidant therapy that could fast eliminate all of these RONS remains challenging, owing largely to the specificity and low activity of exploited nanozymes. Herein, we report a novel single&#8208;atom&#8208;enzyme, Co/PMCS, featuring with atomically dispersed coordinatively unsaturated active Co&#8208;porphyrin centers, can fast obliterate multiple RONS to alleviate sepsis. Co/PMCS can eliminate O2&#8226;&#8208; and H2O2 by mimicking superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, while remove &#8226;OH via the oxidative&#8208;reduction cycle, exhibiting markedly higher activity than nanozymes. Notably, it can also scavenge &#8226;NO through the formation of nitrosyl&#8208;metal complex, hardly accomplished by the current nanozymes. Eventually, it can reduce proinflammatory cytokine level, protect organs from damage and confer a distinct survival advantage to the infected sepsis mice, demonstrating a promising agent for antioxidative therapy.</dc:description>

Eventually, it can reduce proinflammatory cytokine level, protect organs from damage and confer a distinct survival advantage to the infected sepsis mice, demonstrating a promising agent for antioxidative therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Novel main&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polyesters were designed and synthesized to demonstrate liquid crystalline Diels&#8208;Alder dynamic networks (LCDANs) for soft actuator applications. These materials exhibit unprecedented ease for actuator programming and reprocessing compared to existing liquid crystalline network (LCN) systems.

Any actuator can readily be erased at 125  o  C and reprogrammed into a new one under ambient conditions. Moreover, LCDANs can be processed directly from melt (e.g. fiber drawing) and, being dissolvable in solution, from solution as well (e.g. casting tubular actuators), which cannot be achieved with liquid crystalline dynamic networks using exchangeable covalent bonds (vitrimers). The combined attributes of LCDANs are a significant progress toward developing easily programmable/processable LCN actuators.</dc:description>

      <title>Soft Lattice and Defect Covalency Rationalize Tolerance of &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells to Native Defects</title>
      <dc:description>Although all&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have shown tremendous improvement over the past few years, they are still inferior to the hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites in the solar power conversion efficiency. Recently, a conceptually new &#946;&#8208;CsPbI  3  perovskite has demonstrated an impressive 18.4% efficiency combined with good thermodynamic stability at ambient conditions. We use  ab initio  non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics to show that native point defects in &#946;&#8208;CsPbI  3  are generally benign for non&#8208;radiative charge recombination, regardless of whether they introduce shallow or deep trap states. Moreover, formation of new covalently bound species in the presence of defects slows down the recombination. These results indicate that halide perovskites do not follow the simple models used to explain defect&#8208;mediated charge recombination in the conventional semiconductors. The strong tolerance of electron&#8208;hole recombination against defects arises due to the softness of the perovskite lattice, which permits separation of electrons and holes upon defect formation, and allows only low&#8208;frequency vibrations to couple to the electronic subsystem. Both factors decrease significantly the non&#8208;adiabatic coupling and slow down the dissipation of electronic energy to heat. We suggest that a halide&#8208;rich synthesis environment may further improve the efficiency, and propose that strong defect tolerance is general to metal halide perovskites because they exhibit much lower bulk moduli compared to the conventional semiconductors used in photovoltaic, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, lasing, light&#8208;emitting, detecting and other opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this work, a pair of propeller&#8208;like chiral trinuclear Cu(I) clusters with unique photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement property were prepared (designated as  R/S&#8208;Cu3  ).

Herein, we report the use of allyl electrophiles in nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling with a non&#8208;conjugated alkene and dimethylzinc.

High chemoselectivity through substrate directivity is demonstrated in the facile reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;&#947; alkene of the starting material, while the &#949;&#8208;&#950; alkene of the product is preserved.

      <title>Photo&#8208;driven active ion transport through a Janus microporous membrane</title>
      <dc:description>The accurate control of ion transport is a fundamental characteristic for the sustainability of life. Toward practical and high&#8208;performance artificial ion transport system, attaining active transport of ions (protons) in an all&#8208;solid state nanoporous material remains a great challenge. Herein, we develop a Janus microporous membrane by combining reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) for controllable photo&#8208;driven ion transport. Upon light illumination, a net ionic current from CMP to rGO side is generated, indicating that the rGO/CMP Janus membrane can realize photo&#8208;driven directional and anti&#8208;gradient ion transport. Analogously to the p&#8208;n junction in photovoltaic devices, light is firstly converted into separated charges to trigger a transmembrane potential, which subsequently drives directional ion movement. For the first time, this method enables integration of the photovoltaic effect with the ionic field to drive active ion transport. With advantages of up&#8208;scale production and easy fabrication, the concept of photovoltaic ion transport based on Janus microporous membrane will find wide applications in energy storage and conversion, photo&#8208;driven ion&#8208;sieving and water treatment.</dc:description>

Analogously to the p&#8208;n junction in photovoltaic devices, light is firstly converted into separated charges to trigger a transmembrane potential, which subsequently drives directional ion movement. For the first time, this method enables integration of the photovoltaic effect with the ionic field to drive active ion transport. With advantages of up&#8208;scale production and easy fabrication, the concept of photovoltaic ion transport based on Janus microporous membrane will find wide applications in energy storage and conversion, photo&#8208;driven ion&#8208;sieving and water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Magnifying the structural components of bio&#8208;membranes: a prototype self&#8208;assembly study of giant lipids</title>
      <dc:description>How bio&#8208;membranes are self&#8208;organized to perform their functions remains a pivotal issue in biological and chemical science. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly principles of lipid&#8208;like molecules hence becomes crucial.

As a prototype system, giant lipids resemble natural lipidic molecules by capturing their essential features. We demonstrate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of two categories of giant lipids (I&#8208;shape and T&#8208;shape, a total of 8 molecules). A rich variety of mesostructures are constructed in solution state and their molecular packing models are rationally understood. We streamline the driving forces of morphological evolution from both geometric and thermodynamic perspectives. Giant lipids recast the phase behavior of natural lipids to a certain degree, while the abundant self&#8208;assembled morphologies reveal distinct physiochemical behaviors when geometric parameters deviate from natural analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable Surface Wrinkling via Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyamine&#8208;Anion Coacervation Process Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>We demonstrate a bio&#8208;inspired method to render controlled wrinkling surface patterns on supramolecular architectures assembled from polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. It involves polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction generating positively charged coacervates, which while dictating the assembly of POM into spherical structures, further facilitate an interesting surface morphogenesis with wrinkling patterns. This spontaneous surface wrinkling depends on the type of multivalent anion and the pH. Particularly, as the polyamine&#8208;anion interaction becomes stronger, the wrinkles turn denser with lesser depth, which eventually undergoes post&#8208;buckling to engender a complex surface pattern. Interestingly, the order of influence exerted by different anions on the morphology follows the Hofmeister series clearly reflecting the versatiltiy of the method. Further, the mild synthesis conditions keep the the functional POM units dipersed in the sphere with a structural transformability to their lacunary form. Therefore, the presented method is believed to aid in creating exotic surface patterns from various functional units for advanced applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Photoenzymatic Cascades to Synthesize Long Chain Aliphatic Amines and Esters from Renewable Fatty Acids</title>

In addition, long chain aliphatic esters such as 10&#8208;(heptanoyloxy)dec&#8208;8&#8208;ene and octylnonanoate were prepared from ricinoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively, by using the combination of the ADH, a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase variant from Pseudomonas putida  KT2440, and the Cv&#8208;FAP. The target compounds were produced at rates of up to 37 U/g dry cells with conversions up to 90%. Therefore, this study contributes to the preparation of industrially relevant long chain aliphatic chiral amines and esters from renewable fatty acid resources.</dc:description>

      <title>Excited&#8208;state Aromaticity of Gold(III) Hexaphyrins with Metalation Effect Investigated by Time&#8208;resolved Electronic &amp; Vibrational Spectroscopies</title>
      <dc:description>Expanded porphyrins with proper metalation provided us with an excellent opportunity to study excited&#8208;state aromaticity. The coordinated metal helped us to observe the excited&#8208;state aromaticity in the triplet state by the heavy atom effect, but other metalation effects on the excited&#8208;state aromaticity were ambiguous. Here, the excited&#8208;state aromaticity of gold(III) hexaphyrins through the relaxation dynamics was revealed via the electronic and vibrational spectroscopy. The S  Q  states of gold [26]&#8208; and [28] hexaphyrins showed interconvertible absorption and IR spectra with those of counterparts in the ground&#8208;state, indicating aromaticity reversal. Furthermore, while the T  1  states of gold [28] hexaphyrins also exhibited reversed aromaticity according to Baird&#8217;s rule, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer state of gold [26] hexaphyrins contributed by the gold metal showed nonaromatic feature due to the odd&#8208;number of &#960;&#8208;electrons.</dc:description>

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Diaryl and Sterically Hindered Ketones with Ammonium Salts and H2</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) of diaryl or sterically hindered ketones remains unknown and an open challenge. Herein, Ru&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric reductive amination of  ortho  &#8208;OH&#8208;substituted diaryl and sterically hindered ketones with ammonium salts has been disclosed for the first time, offering a straightforward route toward the synthesis of synthetically useful chiral primary diarylmethylamines and sterically hindered benzylamines (up to 97% yield, 93&#8722;&gt;99% ee). The elaborations of chiral amine products into bioactive compounds have been exhibited through manipulations on the removable and convertible &#8208;OH group. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral sterically bulky amine  6ac  and its application in the synthesis of a new benzo&#8208;bisoxazine ligand further showcase the utility of this method.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation of Pertussis&#8208;Like Pentasaccharide Bearing Multiple Rare Sugars as a Potential Anti&#8208;pertussis Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>The 60&#8208;year high  Bordetella pertussis  (  B. pertussis  ) infection rate in the world suggests the urgent need for new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccines. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of  B. pertussis  is an attractive antigen for vaccine development. With the presence of multiple rare sugars and unusual glycosyl linkages,  B. pertussis  LPS is a highly challenging synthetic target. In this work, aided by molecular dynamics simulation and modeling, the pertussis LPS like pentasaccharide was chemically synthesized for the first time. The pentasaccharide was conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946; as a vaccine candidate. Immunization of mice with the conjugate induced robust anti&#8208;glycan IgG responses with IgG titers reaching several million enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units. The antibodies generated were long lasting and boostable, and could recognize multiple clinical strains of  B. pertussis  , highlighting the potential of Q&#946;&#8208;glycan as a new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccine.</dc:description>
