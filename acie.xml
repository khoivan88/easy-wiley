      <title>De novo   Construction of Catenane of Dissymmetric Cages via Space&#8208;Discriminative Post&#8208;Assembly Modification</title>
      <dc:description>Considerable efforts have been made to increase the topological complexity of mechanically interlocked molecules over the years. Three&#8208;dimensional catenated structures composed of two or several cages are one representative example, most of them being made up of symmetric cages. However, due to the lack of an efficient yet universal synthetic strategy, interlocked structures made up of dissymmetric cages are relatively rare. Considering the space volume of the inner cavity of interlocked structure is smaller than that of its outside, we developed a novel synthetic approach with voluminous reductant NaBH(OAc)  3  that discriminates this space difference, and therefore selectively reduce the outer surface of the catenated dimer composed of two symmetric cages, thus yielding the corresponding catenane of dissymmetric&#8208;cages. Insight into the catenation mechanism,  i.e.  the template effect that facilitates catenation of cages, was proved by computational and experimental techniques. We believe, our approach provides an efficient method for the synthesis of catenane of dissymmetric cages, which could potentially be utilized as synthons to engineer novel functional materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B: Implementing H&#8208;bond&#8208;Directed Acceptor Delivery for Highly Selective &#946;&#8208;Glycosylations</title>

      <title>Divergent Strain&#8208;Release Amino&#8208;Functionalization of [1.1.1]&#8208;Propellane with Electrophilic Nitrogen&#8208;Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the development of a photocatalytic strategy for divergent preparation of functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamines. This approach exploits, for the first time, the ability of nitrogen&#8208;radicals to undergo strain&#8208;release reaction with [1.1.1]propellane. This reactivity is facilitated by the electrophilic nature of these open&#8208;shell intermediates and the presence of strong polar effects in the transition&#8208;state for C&#8211;N bond formation/ring&#8208;opening. With the aid of a simple reductive quenching photoredox cycle, we have successfully harnessed this novel radical strain&#8208;release amination as part of a multicomponent cascade compatible with several external trapping agents. Overall, this radical strategy enables the rapid construction of novel amino&#8208;functionalized building blocks with potential application in medicinal chemistry programs as  p  &#8208;substituted aniline bioisosteres.</dc:description>

      <title>A New Approach to Assemble the Thiolated [Au1Ag22(S&#8208;Adm)12]3+ Superatom Complex into a Framework Material: Directly Linked by SbF6&#8208; Anions</title>

      <title>Acetylene as a Dicarbene Equivalent for Gold(I) Catalysis: Total Synthesis of Waitziacuminone in One Step</title>
      <dc:description>
Acetylene gas behaves as a dicarbene equivalent in the presence of gold(I). This concept has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of acetylene gas with alkenes leads to (Z,Z)&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;butadienes and biscyclopropanes depending on the donor ligand on gold(I). Acetylene was generated in&#8197;situ from calcium carbide and water in a user&#8208;friendly procedure. Reaction of acetylene with 1,5&#8208;dienes gives rise stereoselectively to tricyclo[5.1.0.02,4]octanes. This novel double cyclopropanation has been applied to the one step total synthesis of the natural product waitziacuminone from acetylene and geranyl acetone.

      <title>Athermal and Soft Multi&#8208;Nanopatterning of Azopolymers: Phototunable Mechanical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
The phototunable mechanical properties of an azopolymer include a photoswitchable glass&#8208;transition temperature and a photoinduced change from a glassy plastic to a viscoplastic polymer, as shown by H. Yu and et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914201). These phototunable properties enable the on&#8208;demand fabrication of multiple nanopatterns on flexible substrates by athermal nanoimprint lithography and photolithography.

These phototunable properties enable the on&#8208;demand fabrication of multiple nanopatterns on flexible substrates by athermal nanoimprint lithography and photolithography.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Strain&#8208;Increase Ring Contraction Allows the Synthesis of Cyclobutyl Boronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
React to contract: Easily accessible cyclic vinyl boronate complexes undergo a strain&#8208;increase ring contraction through a reaction with electrophilic radicals generated by visible light. A variety of cyclobutyl boronic esters can be obtained in high yields and with excellent stereocontrol, including those containing contiguous quaternary stereocenters and also substantially more strained benzofused cyclobutenes.







Abstract
There are a limited number of ring&#8208;contraction methodologies which convert readily available five&#8208;membered rings into strained four&#8208;membered rings. Here we report a photo&#8208;induced radical&#8208;mediated ring contraction of five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring alkenyl boronate complexes into cyclobutanes. The process involves the addition of an electrophilic radical to the electron&#8208;rich alkenyl boronate complex, leading to an &#945;&#8208;boryl radical. Upon one&#8208;electron oxidation, ring&#8208;contractive 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement occurs to give a cyclobutyl boronic ester. A range of radical precursors and vinyl boronates can be employed, and chiral cyclobutanes can be accessed with high levels of stereocontrol. The process was extended to the preparation of benzofused cyclobutenes and the versatility of the boronic ester was demonstrated by conversion to other functional groups.

      <title>Homogeneous, Low&#8208;volume, Efficient, and Sensitive Quantitation of Circulating Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 for Cancer Diagnosis and Immunotherapy Response Prediction</title>
      <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;induced thermophoresis quantitation of exosomal programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1, a transmembrane protein) was developed, which integrates effective recognition of aptamer and homogeneous thermophoresis. The facile technique is more sensitive and efficient than the current enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;based methods. Translation of the method into standard clinical practice for immunotherapy prediction and monitoring is anticipated.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but its efficacy is severely hindered by the lack of effective predictors. Herein, we developed a homogeneous, low&#8208;volume, efficient, and sensitive exosomal programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1, a type of transmembrane protein) quantitation method for cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy response prediction (HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1). The method combines a newly evolved aptamer that efficiently binds to PD&#8208;L1 with less hindrance by antigen glycosylation than antibody, and homogeneous thermophoresis with a rapid binding kinetic. As a result, HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 is higher in sensitivity, more rapid in reaction time, and easier to operate than existing enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;based methods. As a consequence of an outstanding improvement of sensitivity, the level of circulating exosomal PD&#8208;L1 detected by HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 can effectively distinguish cancer patients from healthy volunteers, and for the first time was found to correlate positively with the metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Overall, HOLMES&#8208;ExoPD&#8208;L1 brings a fresh approach to exosomal PD&#8208;L1 quantitation, offering unprecedented potential for early cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy response prediction.

Thus, both antipodes of the chiral trifluoromethyl&#8208;heterocycles 4  can be obtained in excellent enantiopurity using only a single antipode of the chiral catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Photocatalyzing Waste Plastics into C2 Fuels under Simulated Natural Environments</title>
      <dc:description>Plastics take 250&#8722;500 years to degrade naturally, while their chemical degradation typically requires additional energy or causes secondary pollution. Here, we first realize high&#8208;selectivity conversion of various waste plastics into C2 fuels under simulated natural environments via a designed photoinduced sequential C&#8722;C cleavage and coupling pathway, where the real&#8208;world single&#8208;use bags, disposable food containers, food wrap films and their main components of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride can be photocatalyzed into CH3COOH without using sacrificial agents. As an example, polyethylene can be 100% photodegraded into the exclusive CO2 within 40 h by the single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thick Nb2O5 layers, while the produced CO2 can be further selectively photoreduced into CH3COOH. In&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, synchrotron&#8208;radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectra, H218O and 18O2 isotope&#8208;labeling experiments disclose the O2 and &#8231;OH radicals trigger the oxidative C&#8722;C cleavage of polyethylene to form CO2, while in&#8208;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra, D2O and 13CO2 isotope&#8208;labeling experiments unveil the yielded CH3COOH is stemmed from CO2 photoreduction via C&#8722;C coupling of &#8231;COOH intermediates. This work first establishes the underlying two&#8208;step C&#8722;C cleavage and coupling mechanism of plastic&#8208;to&#8208;fuel, which may open new avenues for simultaneously addressing white pollution crisis and harvesting highly valuable multi&#8208;carbon fuels under natural environments.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Strategy for Macrotheranostic Prodrug Activation: Synergy by Tumor Acidic Microenvironment and Bioorthogonal Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Prodrugs activated by endogenous stimuli face the problem of tumor heterogeneity. Bioorthogonal prodrug activation that utilizes exogenous click reaction has the potential to solve this problem, but most of the strategies currently used to label click reaction groups in tumors still rely on the presence of endogenous targeted receptors or overexpressed enzymes. We herein integrate the tumor ubiquitous acidic extracellular microenvironment and click reaction as a general strategy for bioorthogonal prodrug activation. This strategy was achieved by labeling tumor with click reaction groups through a tumor pH&#8208;responsive polymer containing tetrazine groups, which were unreactive in micelles in the blood circulation but could be activated in response to the tumor pH&#8208;induced micelle disassembly. The vinyl ether group on the macrotheranostic prodrug (CyPVE) can react selectively with the tetrazine group&#8208;labeled tumor, which was confirmed by tumor&#8208;specific fluorescence activation and phototoxicity restoration. Therefore, the bioorthogonal reactions in the context of the ubiquitous tumor acidic microenvironment can provide a general strategy for bioorthogonal prodrug activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Manganese Doping Induced Quantum Confinement within Host Perovskite Nanocrystals through Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Defects</title>
      <dc:description>The concept of doping   Mn  2+   ions into II&#8208;VI semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) has recently extended to perovskite NCs. To date, most studies on   Mn  2+   doped NCs focus on enhancing the emission related to the Mn  2    +    dopant via an energy transfer mechanism. In this work, we found that the doping of Mn  2+  ions into CsPbCl  3  NCs not only results in a   Mn  2+   &#8208;related orange emission, but also strongly influences the excitonic properties of the host NCs. We observe for the first time that   Mn  2+   doping leads to the formation of Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (R.P.) defects and thus induces quantum confinement within the host NCs. We find that a slight doping with Mn  2+  ions improves the size distribution of the NCs, which results in a prominent excitonic peak. However, with increasing the Mn  2+  concentration, the number of R.P. planes increases leading to smaller single crystal domains. The thus enhanced confinement and crystal inhomogeneity cause a gradual blue shift and broadening of the excitonic transition, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Thioguanosine conversion enables mRNA life&#8208;time evaluation by RNA sequencing via double metabolic labeling</title>
      <dc:description>Temporal information about cellular RNA populations is essential to understand the functional roles of RNA. We have developed hydrazine/NH  4  Cl/OsO  4  &#8211;based conversion of 6&#8208;thioguanosine (6sG)&#8208; into A'&#8208;containing RNA, where A' constitutes a 6&#8208;hydrazino purine derivative. The A' nucleoside retains the Watson&#8208;Crick base pair mode as shown by crystal structure analysis of a short palindromic duplex and thermodynamic analysis of UV&#8208;melting profiles. We further demonstrate that A' is efficiently decoded as adenosine in primer extension assays and in RNA sequencing experiments. Because 6sG is applicable to metabolic labeling of freshly synthesized RNA and because the novel conversion chemistry is fully compatible with the conversion of the frequently applied metabolic label 4&#8208;thiouridine (4sU) into C, the combination of both modified nucleosides in dual labeling set&#8208;ups enables high accuracy measurements of RNA decay. Our novel approach that we name TUC&#8208;seq DUAL uses the two modified nucleotides in subsequent pulses and their simultaneous detection. Thus, synthesis and decay of mRNA can be clearly distinguished based on the differential presence of G&#8208;to&#8208;A and U&#8208;to&#8208;C mutations. This enables mRNA life&#8208;time evaluation with unprecedented precision.</dc:description>

We have developed hydrazine/NH  4  Cl/OsO  4  &#8211;based conversion of 6&#8208;thioguanosine (6sG)&#8208; into A'&#8208;containing RNA, where A' constitutes a 6&#8208;hydrazino purine derivative. The A' nucleoside retains the Watson&#8208;Crick base pair mode as shown by crystal structure analysis of a short palindromic duplex and thermodynamic analysis of UV&#8208;melting profiles. We further demonstrate that A' is efficiently decoded as adenosine in primer extension assays and in RNA sequencing experiments. Because 6sG is applicable to metabolic labeling of freshly synthesized RNA and because the novel conversion chemistry is fully compatible with the conversion of the frequently applied metabolic label 4&#8208;thiouridine (4sU) into C, the combination of both modified nucleosides in dual labeling set&#8208;ups enables high accuracy measurements of RNA decay. Our novel approach that we name TUC&#8208;seq DUAL uses the two modified nucleotides in subsequent pulses and their simultaneous detection. Thus, synthesis and decay of mRNA can be clearly distinguished based on the differential presence of G&#8208;to&#8208;A and U&#8208;to&#8208;C mutations. This enables mRNA life&#8208;time evaluation with unprecedented precision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Analysis of an active deformylation mechanism of 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) in stem cells</title>
      <dc:description>5&#8208;Methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC) is considered the fifth base of the genetic system. Its presence in promoter elements takes part in silencing the corresponding gene. Its removal, associated with the reactivation of silenced genes, is possible via an enigmatic active demethylation process that requires the oxidation of mdC to 5&#8209;hydroxymethyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (hmdC) and further on to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;deoxycytidine (cadC) with the help of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent Tet&#8208;oxygenases. The removal of mdC occurs at the level of the fdC and cadC oxidation state. One pathway involves the action of a dedicated glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome, allowing its replacement by dC. A second is proposed to involve C&#8208;C bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. While the TDG&#8208;induced repair&#8208;based pathway is well characterized, information about the C&#8208;C bond cleaving process is very limited. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel 6&#8208;aza&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (a&#8208;fdC) probe molecule, which was fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mESCs, together with a 2&#8217;&#8208;fluorinated fdC analog (F&#8208;fdC). While deformylation of F&#8208;fdC was clearly observed in vivo, it did not occur with a&#8208;fdC, suggesting that the C&#8208;C bond cleaving deformylation reaction must be initiated by a nucleophilic activation.</dc:description>

Compared with LSCs prepared with classic CsPbI3 NCs, the stability of the LSCs after TPP treatments has been greatly improved, even after long&#8208;term (30 days) immersion in water and strong mercury lamp irradiation (50 mW/cm2). Due to the presence of lone pair electrons on the phosphorus atom, TPP is also used as a photoinitiator, with higher efficiency than other common photoinitiators. A large&#8208;area (~75 cm2) infrared LSCs were achieved with a high optical conversion efficiency of 3.1% at the geometric factor of 10.</dc:description>

      <title>The Role of Organoferrates in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent groundbreaking studies on organoferrates have demonstrated that coordinatively unsaturated three&#8208;coordinate &#963;&#8208;alkylferrates are active catalysts in Fe&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings with Grignard reagents and that pronounced solvent and counterion effects dictate metalate speciation and catalyst activity. Thanks to modern spectroscopic methods, sensitive catalyst intermediates could be analyzed.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition The Role of Organoferrates in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Couplings"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recent groundbreaking studies&lt;/b&gt; on organoferrates have demonstrated that coordinatively unsaturated three&#8208;coordinate &#963;&#8208;alkylferrates are active catalysts in Fe&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings with Grignard reagents and that pronounced solvent and counterion effects dictate metalate speciation and catalyst activity. Thanks to modern spectroscopic methods, sensitive catalyst intermediates could be analyzed.

      <title>Synthesis of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Cyclic Peptides via Catalytic Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
An activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted oxidative cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the assembly of biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids was developed for the synthesis of arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.







Abstract
Biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides comprise an intriguing class of structurally diverse natural products with significant biological activity. Especially noteworthy are the antibiotics arylomycin and its synthetic analogue G0775, which exhibits potent activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Herein, we present a simple, flexible, and reliable strategy based on activating&#8208;group&#8208;assisted catalytic oxidative coupling for assembling biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides from natural amino acids. The synthetic approach was utilized for preparing a number of natural and unnatural biaryl&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides, including arylomycin/G0775 and RP&#8197;66453 cyclic cores.

      <title>Self&#8208;Amplified Photodynamic Therapy through the 1O2&#8208;Mediated Internalization of Photosensitizers from a Ppa&#8208;Bearing Block Copolymer</title>
      <dc:description>
A self&#8208;amplifying photodynamic therapy (PDT) system, consisting of a 1O2&#8208;responsive block copolymer, enables the controlled release of photosensitizers in tumor cells. Under NIR&#8208;light irradiation, the photosensitizer, Ppa, is released from the nanoparticles by the 1O2&#8208;triggered cleavage of a vinyldithioether linkage. The free photosensitizer increases 1O2 generation, releasing more photosensitizer from the nanoparticle, enhancing the phototoxicity of PDT.







Abstract
Nanocarriers are employed to deliver photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) through the enhanced penetration and retention effect, but disadvantages including the premature leakage and non&#8208;selective release of photosensitizers still exist. Herein, we report a 1O2&#8208;responsive block copolymer (POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;P(MAA&#8208;co&#8208;VSPpaMA) to enhance PDT via the controllable release of photosensitizers. Once nanoparticles formed by the block copolymer have accumulated in a tumor and have been taken up by cancer cells, pyropheophorbide&#8197;a (Ppa) could be controllably released by singlet oxygen (1O2) generated by light irradiation, enhancing the photosensitization. This was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging. The 1O2&#8208;responsiveness of POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;P(MAA&#8208;co&#8208;VSPpaMA) block copolymer enabled the realization of self&#8208;amplified photodynamic therapy by the regulation of Ppa release using NIR illumination. This may provide a new insight into the design of precise PDT.

      <title>Targeting the Small GTPase Superfamily through Their Regulatory Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
What a PAIN: Small GTPases have been notoriously difficult targets for small molecule and biologic therapeutics. This review explores the molecules targeting the GEF, GAP, and GDI GTPase regulatory proteins. It identifies issues in the chemical strategies, including PAINs motifs, insufficient potency, and lack of selectivity, whilst also providing thoughts on how this field will develop in the future.







Abstract
The Ras superfamily of small GTPases are guanine&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;dependent switches essential for numerous cellular processes. Mutations or dysregulation of these proteins are associated with many diseases, but unsuccessful attempts to target the small GTPases directly have resulted in them being classed as &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. The GTP&#8208;dependent signaling of these proteins is controlled by their regulators; guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), and in the Rho and Rab subfamilies, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). This review covers the recent small molecule and biologics strategies to target the small GTPases through their regulators. It seeks to critically re&#8208;evaluate recent chemical biology practice, such as the presence of PAINs motifs and the cell&#8208;based readout using compounds that are weakly potent or of unknown specificity. It highlights the vast scope of potential approaches for targeting the small GTPases in the future through their regulatory proteins.

      <title>Supramolecular Tuning Enables Selective Oxygen Reduction Catalyzed by Cobalt Porphyrins for Direct Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide
</title>
      <dc:description>
ORR inspiring: Incorporating cobalt porphyrins into a porous supramolecular cage structure isolates molecular active sites for selective electrochemical oxygen reduction, leading to direct electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide in neutral pH water.







Abstract
We report a supramolecular strategy for promoting the selective reduction of O2 for direct electrosynthesis of H2O2. We utilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (Co&#8208;TPP), an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst with highly variable product selectivity, as a building block to assemble the permanently porous supramolecular cage Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) bearing six Co&#8208;TPP subunits connected through twenty&#8208;four imine bonds. Reduction of these imine linkers to amines yields the more flexible cage Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6). Both Co&#8208;PB&#8208;1(6) and Co&#8208;rPB&#8208;1(6) cages produce 90&#8211;100&#8201;% H2O2 from electrochemical ORR catalysis in neutral pH water, whereas the Co&#8208;TPP monomer gives a 50&#8201;% mixture of H2O2 and H2O. Bimolecular pathways have been implicated in facilitating H2O formation, therefore, we attribute this high H2O2 selectivity to site isolation of the discrete molecular units in each supramolecule. The ability to control reaction selectivity in supramolecular structures beyond traditional host&#8211;guest interactions offers new opportunities for designing such architectures for a broader range of catalytic applications.

      <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Propargyl Amide with Vicinal Stereocenters through Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral propargyl amines are valuable synthetic intermediates for the preparation of biologically active compounds and functionalized amines. Catalytic methods to access propargyl amines containing vicinal stereocenters with high diastereoselectivity are particularly rare. We report an unprecedented strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargyl amines with two stereogenic centres.

A very mild single&#8208;pass gas&#8208;phase conversion of [  11  C]carbon monoxide into [  11  C]carbonyl difluoride over silver(II) fluoride provides easy access to this new synthon in robust quantitative yield for labeling a broad range of cyclic substrates e.g., imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, and oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Labeling reactions utilize close to stoichiometric precursor quantities and short reaction times at room temperature in a wide range of solvents while also showing high water tolerability.

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Hierarchical Nanosized Single&#8208;Crystal Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves from Highly Homogeneous and Concentrated Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical nanosized single&#8208;crystal zeotypes: AEL&#8208;, AFI&#8208;, LTA&#8208;, and &#8208;CLO&#8208;type aluminophosphate molecular sieve nanocrystals with intracrystalline mesopores have been synthesized from highly homogeneous and concentrated precursors without growth modifiers and mesoporogens.







Abstract
The synthesis of hierarchical nanosized zeolite materials without growth modifiers and mesoporogens remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a general synthetic approach to produce hierarchical nanosized single&#8208;crystal aluminophosphate molecular sieves by preparing highly homogeneous and concentrated precursors and heating at elevated temperatures. Accordingly, aluminophosphate zeotypes of LTA (8&#8208;rings), AEL (10&#8208;rings), AFI (12&#8208;rings), and &#8208;CLO (20&#8208;rings) topologies, ranging from small to extra&#8208;large pores, were synthesized. These materials show exceptional properties, including small crystallites (30&#8211;150&#8197;nm), good monodispersity, abundant mesopores, and excellent thermal stability. A time&#8208;dependent study revealed a non&#8208;classical crystallization pathway by particle attachment. This work opens a new avenue for the development of hierarchical nanosized zeolite materials and understanding their crystallization mechanism.

      <title>Accurate Control of VS2 Nanosheets for Coexisting High Photoluminescence and Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional amorphous VS2 and partial crystallized 2D VO2(D) nanosheets are successfully fabricated using supercritical CO2. Full band absorption, strong photoluminescence, and outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency co&#8208;exist owing to the unique 2D amorphous structure.







Abstract
In two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous nanosheets, the electron&#8211;phonon coupling triggered by localization of the electronic state as well as multiple&#8208;scattering feature make it exhibit excellent performance in optical science. VS2 nanosheets, especially single&#8208;layer nanosheets with controllable electronic structure and intrinsic optical properties, have rarely been reported owing to the limited preparation methods. Now, a controllable and feasible switching method is used to fabricate 2D amorphous VS2 and partial crystallized 2D VO2(D) nanosheets by altering the pressure and temperature of supercritical CO2 precisely. Thanks to the strong carrier localization and the quantum confinement, the unique 2D amorphous structures exhibit full band absorption, strong photoluminescence, and outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency.

      <title>Fast Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminomethylation of Alkenes and the Formal Conversion of Methylamine</title>

      <title>A Liquid/Liquid Electrolyte Interface Inhibiting Corrosion and Dendrite Growth of Lithium in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Li&#8208;metal anode can easily react with the conventional electrolyte components for the unwanted side reaction and possess uniformly Li+  deposition for Li dendrite growth, resulting in its low Columbic efficiency and safety issue in Li metal batteries (LMBs).

The L/L electrolyte interface constructed by non&#8208;polar fluorosilicane (PFTOS) and conventionally polar dimethyl sulfoxide solvents can block the direct contact between conventional electrolyte and Li anode, and consequently their side reactions can be significantly eliminated. Moreover, the homogeneous Li&#8208;ion &#64258;ow and Li&#8208;mass deposition can be realized by the formation of a thin and uniform solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) composed of LiF, Li  x  C, Li  x  SiO  y  between PFTOS and Li anode, as well as the super&#8208;wettability state of PFTOS to Li anode, resulting in the suppression of Li dendrite formation. Taking lithium&#8208;oxygen battery as a model LMBs, its cycling stability is improved over 4 times of the original value in the presence of the L/L electrolyte interface. This concept shows the first and successful demonstration of the L/L electrolyte interface for the sustainable Li&#8208;metal electrode in LMBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Algae Extraction Controllable Delamination of Vanadium Carbide Nanosheets with Enhanced Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Performance</title>
      <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide (V  2  C) MXene has shown great potential as a photothermal agent (PTA) for photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the use of V  2  C in PTT is limited by the harsh synthesis condition and low photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE). Herein, to address such an issue, we report a completely different green delamination method using algae extraction to intercalate and delaminate V  2  AlC to produce mass V  2  C nanosheets (NSs) with a high yield (90%). The resulting V  2  C NSs demonstrated good structural integrity and remarkably high absorption in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region with a PTCE as high as 48% under an 808&#8208;laser irradiation. It is superior to the previously reported MXene photothermal agents, including Mo  2  C (42.9%), Nb  2  C (36.4% at NIR&#8208;I and 45.65% at NIR&#8208;II), Ta  4  C  3  (44.7%), and even comparable to the cutting&#8208;edge photo absorption agents, such as gold&#8208;based materials, and carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. Systemic in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the V  2  C NSs severe as efficient PTA for photoacoustic (PA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided photothermal hyperthermia of cancer.

      <dc:description>Surface atomic arrangement and coordination of photocatalysts highly exposed to different crystal facets significantly affect the photoreactivity. However, controversies on the true photoreactivity of a specific facet in heterogeneous photocatalysis still exits. Herein, we exemplified well&#8208;defined BiOBr nanosheets dominating with respective facets, (001) and (010), to track the reactivity of crystal facets for photocatalytic water splitting. The real photoreactivity of BiOBr&#8208;(001) were evidenced to be significantly higher than BiOBr&#8208;(010) for both hydrogen production and oxygen evolution reactions. Further in&#8208;situ photochemical probing studies verified the distinct reactivity is not only owing to the highly exposed facets, but dominantly determined by the co&#8208;exposing facets, making the spatial separation of photogenerated charges between top and lateral facets takes place efficiently. Such spatial charge separation renders the reduction and oxidation reactions separately to occur onto the dominate facet and the co&#8208;exposing facet with different reaction rates, which ordains the fate of the true photoreactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer Induces Bicyclizations that Tolerate Electron&#8208;rich and &#8211;deficient Intermediate Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>A novel Co(II)&#8208;catalyzed polyene cyclization was developed that is uniquely effective when performed in hexafluoroisopropanol as solvent. The process is presumably initiated by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) to 1,1&#8208;disubstituted or monosubstituted alkenes, and the reaction is remarkable for its tolerance of internal alkenes bearing either electron&#8208;rich methyl or electron&#8208;deficient nitrile substituents; electron&#8208;rich aromatic terminators are required in both cases. Terpenoid scaffolds with different substitution patterns are obtained with excellent diastereoselectivities, and the bioactive C20&#8208;oxidized abietane diterpenoid carnosaldehyde was made to showcase the utility of the nitrile&#8208;bearing products. We also provide the results of several mechanistic experiments that suggest that the process features an MHAT&#8208;induced radical bicyclization with late&#8208;stage oxidation to regenerate the aromatic terminator.</dc:description>

      <title>Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates by Stereoselective Copolymerization of Racemic Diolides: Stereocontrol Mechanism and Polyolefin&#8208;Like Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of biodegradable polymers due to their biodegradability in ambient environments and structural diversity enabled by side&#8208;chain groups. However, the biosynthesis of PHAs is slow and expensive, limiting their broader applications as commodity plastics. To overcome such limitation, the catalyzed chemical synthesis of bacterial PHAs has been developed via the metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerization of racemic cyclic diolides (  rac&#8208;8DL  R  , R = alkyl group). In this combined experimental and computational study, polymerization kinetics, stereocontrol mechanism, copolymerization characteristics, and the resulting PHAs' properties have been examined. Most notably, stereoselective copolymerizations of&#160;    rac&#8208;8DL  Me   with&#160;     rac&#8208;8DL  R   (R = Et, Bu) have yielded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight, crystalline isotactic PHA copolymers that are hard, ductile, and tough plastics, and exhibit polyolefin&#8208;like thermal and mechanical properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Hierarchical Hollow Co9S8/ZnIn2S4 Tubular Heterostructures for Highly Efficient Solar Energy Conversion and Environmental Remediation</title>
      <dc:description>The rational construction of heterojunctions and design of photocatalyst structures are considered effective approaches to enhance photocatalytic activities. Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive hierarchical Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  tubular heterostructures are fabricated by growing two&#8208;dimensional ZnIn  2  S  4  nanosheets on one&#8208;dimensional hollow Co  9  S  8  nanotubes. This rational design combines two photoresponsive sulfide semiconductors in a stable heterojunction with a hierarchical hollow tubular structure, improving visible&#8208;light absorption, yielding a large surface area, exposing sufficient catalytically active sites, and effectively promoting the separation and migration of photogenerated charges. The as&#8208;prepared hierarchical Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  nanotubes thus exhibit excellent photocatalytic H  2  evolution and Cr(VI) reduction efficiency. Under visible&#8208;light illumination, the optimized Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  heterostructure provides a remarkable H  2  generation rate of 9039 &#956;mol h  &#8722;1  g  &#8722;1  without the use of any co&#8208;catalysts (metal complex, noble metal, etc.), and Cr(VI) is completely reduced in 45 min. The Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  heterostructure also displays long&#8208;term stability after multiple photocatalytic cycles. Finally, the relevant photogenerated charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic mechanisms of the Co  9  S  8  /ZnIn  2  S  4  heterostructures are proposed and analyzed.</dc:description>

Their emission maxima can be dynamically tuned from 440 to 530 nm by changing the excitation wavelength. Through both experimental and theoretical studies, we propose that the continuously tunable photoluminescence originates from multiple emissive excited states as a result of the existence of varied Au(I)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(I) distances in ground state. The steric properties of the NHC ligand are crucial to the tuning of Au(I)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(I) distances. We also demonstrate an anti&#8208;counterfeiting application using these two salts.

Here, we report that a sodium benzenedithiolate (PhS2Na2)&#8208;rich protection layer synthesized in situ on sodium by a facile methodology effectively prevents dendrite growth in the carbonate electrolyte, leading to a stabilized sodium metal electrodeposition for 400 cycles (800 h) of repeated plating/stripping at a current density of 1mA cm&#8208;2. The organic salt, PhS2Na2, is found to be a critical component in the protection layer, and is different from traditional inorganic salts. This &#64257;nding opens up a new and promising avenue, based on organic sodium slats, to stabilize sodium metals with protection layer.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;Depth TEM Investigation on Structural Inhomogeneity within a Primary LixNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 Particle: Origin of Capacity Decay during High&#8208;Rate Discharge</title>
      <dc:description>
Origin of capacity decay: Structural evolutions within a primary LiNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 (NCA83) particle, as a cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries, were investigated during various electrochemical processes using TEM. Significant reduction in the electrochemical capacity of NCA83 in the second charge is correlated with the development of nano&#8208;scale and micro&#8208;scale structural inversions.







Abstract
The structural stability of cathode materials during electrochemical reactions, in particular, under high&#8208;rate discharge, is pertinent to the design and development of new electrode materials. This study investigates the structural inhomogeneity that develops within a single LiNi0.835Co0.15Al0.015O2 (NCA83) particle during a fast discharging process under different cutoff voltages. Some of the NCA83 particles discharged from a high cutoff voltage (4.8&#8197;V) developed surface areas in which the layered structure was recovered, although the interiors retained the degraded spinel structure. These micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale structural inversions from high cutoff voltage seem highly correlated with structural evolutions in the initial charged state, and may ultimately degrade the cycling stability. This study advances understanding of the structural inhomogeneity within primary particles during various electrochemical processes and may facilitate the development of new Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

      <title>In&#8197;Vivo Solid&#8208;Phase Microextraction for Sampling of Oxylipins in Brain of Awake, Moving Rats</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible in&#8197;vivo solid&#8208;phase microextraction was used to measure 52 eicosanoids and other oxylipins directly in brains of awake moving rats with high temporal and spatial resolution. In&#8197;vivo profiles of extracellular brain fluid did not reflect oxylipin concentrations in post&#8208;mortem tissue and provide a novel tool to elucidate oxylipin pathways and function.







Abstract
Oxylipins are key lipid mediators of important brain processes, including pain, sleep, oxidative stress, and inflammation. For the first time, an in&#8208;depth profile of up to 52 oxylipins can be obtained from the brains of awake moving animals using in&#8197;vivo solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) chemical biopsy tool in combination with liquid chromatography&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry. Among these, 23 oxylipins are detectable in the majority of healthy wildtype samples. This new approach successfully eliminates the changes in oxylipin concentrations routinely observed during the analysis of post&#8208;mortem samples, allows time&#8208;course monitoring of their concentrations with high spatial resolution in specific brain regions of interest, and can be performed using the same experimental set&#8208;up as in&#8197;vivo microdialysis (MD) thus providing a new and exciting tool in neuroscience and drug discovery.

      <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics strategy is used to implant a &#8220;GPS device&#8221; on bacteria to track their location and interacting proteins. This strategy, reported by W.&#8197;A. Tao, Y. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;2235, involves labeling the living bacteria with a photoreactive linker and a biotin group for the isolation and analysis of crosslinked proteins by mass spectrometry at designated time points during the bacterial infection.

      <title>The Chemistry, Biology, and Modulation of Ammonium Nitrification in Soil</title>
      <dc:description>
The low efficiency of ammonium fertilizers used in agriculture contributes to significant environmental issues and economic losses. This Review discusses the chemistry and enzymatic mechanisms of microbial nitrification in the soil and highlights phytochemicals which can act as nitrification inhibitors, thus providing opportunities to stabilize ammonium in farm soils to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use.







Abstract
Approximately two percent of the world's energy is consumed in the production of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gas. Ammonia is used as a fertilizer ingredient for agriculture and distributed in the environment on an enormous scale to promote crop growth in intensive farming. Only 30&#8211;50&#8201;% of the nitrogen applied is assimilated by crop plants; the remaining 50&#8211;70&#8201;% goes into biological processes such as nitrification by microbial metabolism in the soil. This leads to an imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle and higher nitrous oxide emissions (a potent and significant greenhouse gas) as well as contamination of ground and surface waters by nitrate from the nitrogen&#8208;fertilized farmland. This Review gives a critical overview of the current knowledge of soil microbes involved in the chemistry of ammonia nitrification, the structures and mechanisms of the enzymes involved, and phytochemicals capable of inhibiting ammonia nitrification.

This Review gives a critical overview of the current knowledge of soil microbes involved in the chemistry of ammonia nitrification, the structures and mechanisms of the enzymes involved, and phytochemicals capable of inhibiting ammonia nitrification.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
[2.2]Paracyclophane (PCP) is a prevalent scaffold that is widely utilized in asymmetric synthesis, &#960;&#8208;stacked polymers, energy materials, and functional parylene coatings that finds broad applications in bio&#8208; and materials science. In the last few years, [2.2]paracyclophane chemistry has progressed tremendously, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of its structural and functional properties. This Minireview highlights the most important recent synthetic developments in the selective functionalization of PCP that govern distinct features of planar chirality as well as chiroptical and optoelectronic properties. Special focus is given to the function&#8208;inspired design of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;stacked conjugated materials by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Current synthetic challenges, limitations, as well as future research directions and new avenues for advancing cyclophane chemistry are also summarized.

      <title>Reshaping of Metal Nanoparticles Under Reaction Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting into shape: This Minireview gives a summary of the latest progress in characterizing and modeling the equilibrium shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in reactive environments through the combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) experiments and the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model.







Abstract
The shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is one of the key factors determining their catalytic reactivity. Recent in&#8197;situ TEM observations show that dynamic reshaping of metal NPs occurs under the reaction conditions, which becomes a major hurdle for fully understanding catalytic mechanisms at the molecular level. This Minireview provides a summary of the latest progress in characterizing and modeling the equilibrium shape of metal NPs in various reactive environments through the joint effort of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy experiments and a newly developed multiscale structure reconstruction model. The quantitative agreement between the experimental observations and theoretical modeling demonstrate that the fundamental mechanism of the reshaping phenomenon is driven by anisotropically changed surface energies under gas adsorption. The predictable reshaping of metal NPs paves the way for the rational design of truly efficient nanocatalysts in real reactions.

      <title>Blocking the Hype&#8208;Hypocrisy&#8208;Falsification&#8208;Fakery Pathway is Needed to Safeguard Science</title>
      <dc:description>
Hype in science is commonplace, compounded by the hypocrisy of those who engage in or tolerate it while disapproving of the consequences. These are first steps along a slippery slope of hype, hypocrisy, data falsification, and dissemination of fake science, encouraged by systemic drivers in the contemporary structure of the science establishment. Collective, concerted intervention is required to discourage entry to this dangerous pathway; chemists must play an active role.







Abstract
In chemistry and other sciences, hype has become commonplace, compounded by the hypocrisy of those who tolerate or encourage it while disapproving of the consequences. This reduces the credibility and trust upon which all science depends for support. Hype and hypocrisy are but first steps down a slippery slope towards falsification of results and dissemination of fake science. Systemic drivers in the contemporary structure of the science establishment encourage exaggeration and may lure the individual into further steps along the hype&#8208;hypocrisy&#8208;falsification&#8208;fakery continuum. Collective, concerted intervention is required to effectively discourage entry to this dangerous pathway and to restore and protect the probity and reputation of the science system. Chemists must play and active role in this effort.

      <title>Imparting Multifunctionality by Utilizing Biporosity in a Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
The biporous nature of UiO&#8208;66 is utilized to incorporate conducting polymer moieties into the voids of the metal&#8211;organic framework. In this way the resulting nanocomposites display significant porosity and simultaneous million&#8208;fold enhancement in electrical conductivity along with ultralow thermal conductivity.







Abstract
In this work, we have synthesized nanocomposites made up of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and conducting polymers by polymerization of specialty monomers such as pyrrole (Py) and 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the voids of a stable and biporous Zr&#8208;based MOF (UiO&#8208;66). FTIR and Raman data confirmed the presence of polypyrrole (PPy) and poly3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PPy and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PEDOT nanocomposites, respectively, and PXRD data revealed successful retention of the structure of the MOF. HRTEM images showed successful incorporation of polymer fibers inside the voids of the framework. Owing to the intrinsic biporosity of UiO&#8208;66, polymer chains were observed to selectively occupy only one of the voids. This resulted in a remarkable enhancement (million&#8208;fold) of the electrical conductivity while the nanocomposites retain 60&#8211;70&#8201;% of the porosity of the original MOF. These semiconducting yet significantly porous MOF nanocomposite systems exhibited ultralow thermal conductivity. Enhanced electrical conductivity with lowered thermal conductivity could qualify such MOF nanocomposites for thermoelectric applications.

      <title>Flexible Total Synthesis of 11&#8208;Deoxylandomycins and Their Non&#8208;Natural Analogues by Way of Asymmetric Metal Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A collective total synthesis of 11&#8208; deoxylandomycins is reported using Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of alkoxyallene as the key strategy. This de novo approach allowed for an access to various natural and non&#8208;natural congeners of 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins.







Abstract
A de novo first collective total synthesis of 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins is reported. A signature step is featured by the Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of alcohol to ene&#8208;alkoxyallenes that assembles oligomeric 2,3,6&#8208;trideoxyoligosaccharides. The unique feature of the protocol is illustrated by a flexible access to various natural 11&#8208;deoxylandomycins as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.

      <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Copper(I)&#8208;NHC Complexes: Novel Dual&#8208;Emissive Property and Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>As a kind of photoluminescent materials, Cu(I) complexes have many advantages such as adjustable emission, variable structures and low cost, attracting attention in many fields. In this work, two novel two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I)&#8208;NHC complexes were synthesized, exhibiting unique dual&#8208;emissive property from fluorescence and phosphorescence. The crystal structure, stacking mode and photophysical properties under different conditions were systematically studied, proving the emissive mechanism to be the locally excited state of the carbazole group. Based on this emissive mechanism, ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with a lifetime of 140 ms is achieved by selective deuteration of the carbazole group. These results deepen the understanding of the luminescent mechanism and design strategy in two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes, and prove their potential application as ultralong RTP materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Rapid, High&#8208;Contrast Visualization of Folate&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Expressing Tumors in Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Folate receptors (FRs) are membrane proteins involved in folic acid uptake, and the alpha isoform (FR&#8208;a) is overexpressed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. For fluorescence imaging of FRs in vivo, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (650&#8211;900 nm), where tissue penetration is high and autofluorescence is low, is optimal, but existing NIR fluorescent probes targeting FR&#8208;a show high non&#8208;specific tissue adsorption, and require prolonged washout to visualize tumors. We have designed and synthesized a new NIR fluorescent probe, FolateSiR&#8208;1, utilizing a Si&#8208;rhodamine fluorophore having a carboxy group at the benzene moiety, coupled to a folate ligand moiety via a negatively charged tripeptide linker. This probe exhibits very low background fluorescence, and afforded a tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) of up to 83 in FR&#8208;expressing tumor&#8208;bearing mice within 30 min. Thus, FolateSiR&#8208;1 has the potential to contribute to the research in the field of biology and the clinical medicine.</dc:description>

Moreover, a liquid flow Zn&#8208;air battery is constituted employing the structurally optimized Zn0.4Ni0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (ZNCO/NCNTs) as an efficient air cathode, which presents remarkable power density (109.1 mW cm&#8722;2), high open circuit potential (1.48 V vs. Zn), excellent durability and high&#8208;rate performance. This finding could elucidate the experimentally observed enhancement in the ORR activity of ZnXNi1&#8722;XCo2O4 oxides after the OER test.

      <title>A Molecular Strategy to Lock&#8208;in the Conformation of a Perylene bisimide&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>Locking&#8208;in the conformation of supramolecular assemblies provides a new avenue to regulate the (opto)electronic properties of robust nanoscale objects. In the present contribution, we show that the covalent tethering of a perylene bisimide (PBI)&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer with a molecular locker enables the formation of a locked superstructure equipped with emergent structure&#8208;function relationships. Experiments that exploit variable&#8208;temperature ground&#8208;state electronic absorption spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrate that the excitonic coupling between nearest neighboring units in the tethered superstructure is preserved at a temperature (371 K) where the pristine, non&#8208;covalent assembly exists exclusively in a molecularly dissolved state. A close examination of the solid&#8208;state morphologies reveals that the locked superstructure engenders the formation of hierarchical 1D materials which are not achievable by unlocked assemblies. To complement these structural attributes, we further demonstrate that covalently tethering a supramolecular polymer built from PBI subunits enables the emergence of electronic properties not evidenced in non&#8208;covalent assemblies. Using cyclic voltammetry experiments, the elucidation of the potentiometric properties of the locked superstructure reveals a 100&#8208;mV stabilization of the conduction band energy when compared to that recorded for a non&#8208;covalent assembly.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low Pressure Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Separations</title>
      <dc:description>The resurgence of interest in the hydrogen economy could hinge on the distribution of hydrogen in a safe and efficient manner. Whilst great progress has been made with cryogenic hydrogen storage or liquefied ammonia, Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) remain attractive due to their lack of need for cryogenic temperatures or high pressures, most commonly a cycle between methylcyclohexane and toluene. Oxidation of methylcyclohexane to release hydrogen will be more efficient if the equilibrium limitations can be removed by separating the mixture. This report describes a family of six ternary and quaternary multicomponent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that contain the three&#8208;dimensional cubane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (cdc) ligand. Of these MOFs, the most promising is a quaternary MOF (CUB&#8208;30), comprising cdc, 4,4'&#8208;biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdc) and tritopic truxene linkers. Contrary to conventional wisdom that adsorptive interactions with larger, hydrocarbon guests are dominated by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, here we report that contoured aliphatic pore environments can exhibit high selectivity and capacity for LOHC separations at low pressures. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, where selective adsorption for cyclohexane over benzene is witnessed, underlining the unique adsorptive behavior afforded by the unconventional cubane moiety.</dc:description>

Of these MOFs, the most promising is a quaternary MOF (CUB&#8208;30), comprising cdc, 4,4'&#8208;biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdc) and tritopic truxene linkers. Contrary to conventional wisdom that adsorptive interactions with larger, hydrocarbon guests are dominated by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, here we report that contoured aliphatic pore environments can exhibit high selectivity and capacity for LOHC separations at low pressures. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, where selective adsorption for cyclohexane over benzene is witnessed, underlining the unique adsorptive behavior afforded by the unconventional cubane moiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of Diverse Electron&#8208;deficient Corona[5]arenes and Their Selective Complexation with Dihydrogen Phosphate: A Cooperative Effect of Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report in this communication the synthesis, conformational structure, electrochemical property and non&#8208;covalent anion binding of corona[5]arenes. A [3+2] fragment coupling reaction of 1,4&#8208;bis((6&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene and derivatives with HS&#8208;C  6  H  4  &#8208;X&#8208;C  6  H  4  &#8208;SH (X = S, CH  2  , CMe  2  and O) proceeded efficiently under mild conditions to produce a number of novel heteroatom and methylene bridged corona[3]arene[2]tetrazine macrocycles. Further selective oxidation of the sulfur atom between two phenylene rings afforded sulfoxide&#8208; and sulfone&#8208;linked corona[5]arenes in good yields. All corona[5]arenes synthesized adopted similar 1,2,4&#8208;alternate conformational structures forming pentagonal cavities. The cavity sizes and the electronic properties such as redox potentials, which were measured with CV and DPV, were regulated by the combination of bridging units. As electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles, the acquired corona[3]arene[2]tetrazines acted as highly selective hosts to form complexes with the hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer of dihydrogen phosphate through cooperative anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>A Sequential Dual&#8208;Lock Strategy for Photoactivatable Chemiluminescent Probes Enabling Bright Duplex Optical Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;based technologies have revolutionized in&#8208;vivo monitoring of biomolecules. However, significant technical hurdles in probe chemistry have limited the achievement of trigger&#8208;controlled, bright and enriched CL signal. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;lock strategy by sequence&#8208;dependent triggers for bright optical imaging with the integration of real&#8208;time fluorescent signal and ultra&#8208;sensitive CL signal. These probes can obtain an analyte&#8208;triggered accumulation of stable pre&#8208;chemiluminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and then the pre&#8208;chemiluminophore exhibits a rapid photooxidation process (1,2&#8208;dioxetane generation) by TICT&#8208;based free&#8208;radical addition, thereby achieving an enrichment and bright CL signal. The dual&#8208;lock strategy expands the in vivo toolbox for highly accurate analysis, and has for the first time allowed access to accurately sense and trace biomolecules with high&#8208;resolution, dual&#8208;mode of chemo&#8208;fluoro&#8208;luminescence, and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging in living animals.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Despite the great effort, the only feasible access to non face&#8208;centered cubic (  FCC  ) copper is by physical vapor deposition under high vacuum. We report the first observation of non&#8208;  FCC  copper in a series of alkynyl protected Cu  53  nanoclusters (NCs) obtained from solution phase synthesis.

It can be regarded as a mixed  FCC  and  HCP  structure, which gives strong evidence that Cu can be arranged in non&#8208;  FCC  lattice at ambient condition when proper ligands are provided. To gain a deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of Cu NCs, characterization methods including X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, XPS, ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;vis, Auger spectroscopies and DFT calculations are carried out. It is revealed that Cu  II  successively coordinated with introduced ligands and changed to Cu  I  after bonding with phosphine.

      <title>High ethylene selectivity in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction over MOR nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Precisely controlled crystal growth endows zeolites with special textural and catalytic properties. A nanosheet mordenite zeolite with a thickness of ~11 nm, named as MOR&#8208;NS, has been prepared using a well&#8208;designed gemini&#8208;type amphiphilic surfactant as bifunctional structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA). Its benzyl diquarternary ammonium cations structurally directed the formation of MOR topology, whereas the long and hydrophobic hexadecyl tailing group prevented the extensive crystal growth along  b  axis. This kind of orientated crystallization took place through the inorganic&#8208;organic interaction between silica species and SDA molecules existing in the whole process. The thin MOR nanosheets, with highly exposed (010) planes and 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) windows therein, exhibited an extremely higher ethylene selectivity (42.1%) for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin reactions when compared with conventional bulk MOR crystals (3.3%). Moreover, MOR&#8208;NS also possessed hierarchical structure and larger external surface area, making it a promising catalyst for processing bulky reactions like the alkylation of anisole with benzyl alcohol.</dc:description>

Its benzyl diquarternary ammonium cations structurally directed the formation of MOR topology, whereas the long and hydrophobic hexadecyl tailing group prevented the extensive crystal growth along  b  axis. This kind of orientated crystallization took place through the inorganic&#8208;organic interaction between silica species and SDA molecules existing in the whole process. The thin MOR nanosheets, with highly exposed (010) planes and 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) windows therein, exhibited an extremely higher ethylene selectivity (42.1%) for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin reactions when compared with conventional bulk MOR crystals (3.3%). Moreover, MOR&#8208;NS also possessed hierarchical structure and larger external surface area, making it a promising catalyst for processing bulky reactions like the alkylation of anisole with benzyl alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Catalytic Regioselective Isomerization of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes to Homoallylic Alcohols.</title>
      <dc:description>The selective isomerization of strained heterocyclic compounds is an important tool in organic synthesis. An unprecedented regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes to homoallylic alcohols is described. The use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3), a commercially available Lewis acid was key to obtain good yields and selectivities since other Lewis acids afforded mixtures of isomers and substantial polymerization. The reaction took place under exceptionally mild conditions and very low catalyst loading (0.5 mol %). DFT calculations disclose the mechanistic features of the isomerization and account for the high selectivity displayed by the B(C6F5)3 catalyst. The synthetic applicability of the new reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of &#947;&#8208;chiral alcohols using iridium catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.</dc:description>

      <title>Calixarene&#8208;Based Supramolecular AIE Dots with Highly Inhibited Nonradiative Decay and Intersystem Crossing for Ultrasensitive Fluorescence Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular motion&#8208;associated organic molecules such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) for disease phototheranostics are attracting increasing attention; however, how to optimally harvest absorbed excitation energy for advanced fluorescence imaging/diagnosis and concurrently avoid unnecessary phototoxicity during bioimaging process is still challenging. To address this issue, herein, we report that the host&#8208;guest complexation between calix[5]arene and AIEgen can significantly turn off both the energy dissipation pathways of intersystem crossing and thermal deactivation, enabling the absorbed excitation energy mostly focusing on fluorescence emission. The co&#8208;assembly of calix[5]arene amphiphiles and AIEgens affords highly emissive supramolecular AIE nanodots thanks to their interaction extremely restricting the intramolecular motion of AIEgens, which also show negligible cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generation.  In vivo  studies with a peritoneal carcinomatosis&#8208;bearing mouse model indicate that such supramolecular AIE dots have rather low  in vivo  side toxicity and can serve as a superior fluorescent bioprobe for ultrasensitive fluorescence image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.</dc:description>

      <title>Mixed polyanionic compounds as positive electrodes in low&#8208;cost electrochemical energy storage</title>
      <dc:description>Low cost electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) are urgently demanded to promote the application of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, etc. Learning from the history of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the cost of EESSs depends mainly on charge&#8208;carrier ions and redox centers in electrodes, and their performances are limited by positive electrodes. In this scenario, the minireview evaluates several EESSs candidates, and summarizes the known mixed polyanionic compounds (MPCs)&#8212;a family with robust frameworks and large channels for ion storage and migration.
