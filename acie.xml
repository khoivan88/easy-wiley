      <title>Accessing Tunable Afterglows from Highly Twisted Nonaromatic Organic AIEgens via Effective Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
      <dc:description>Nonaromatic, cross&#8208;conjugated, and highly twisted luminogens consisting of acylated succinimides demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics and tunable multicolor photoluminescence and afterglows in their single crystals. Effective through&#8208;space conjugation among different moieties bearing n/&#960; electrons promote the spin orbit coupling and intersystem crossing transitions and lead to diverse emissive clusters with concurrently rigidified conformations, thus allowing readily tunable emissions. Derived from it, the proof of concept application for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is illustrated. These results should spur the rational design of novel nonaromatic AIEgens, and moreover advance understandings of the non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence and the origin of tunable multicolor afterglows.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfonium&#8208;based Homolytic Substitution Observed for the Radical SAM Enzyme HemN</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;based homolytic substitution (SH) plays an important role in synthetic chemistry, yet whether such a chemistry could occur on the positively charged sulfonium compounds remains unknown. In the study of the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN, a radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme involved in Heme biosynthesis, we observed the production of di&#8208;(5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl)methylsulfonium, supporting&#160; a deoxyadenosyl (dAdo) radical&#8208;mediated SH reaction on the sulfonium center of SAM. The sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions were then investigated in detail by density functional theory calculations and by model reactions, showing that such a type of reactions is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically competent. These findings represent the first report of sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions, which could be useful in synthetic chemistry. Our study also demonstrates the remarkable catalytic promiscuity of the radical SAM superfamily enzymes, which could be a treasury in studying organic reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Corrosion of heritage objects: collagen&#8208;like triple helix found in the calcium acetate hemihydrate crystal structure</title>
      <dc:description>Helical motifs are common in nature, e.g. the DNA double or the collagen triple helix. In the latter proteins, the helical motif originates from glycine, the smallest amino acid, whose molecular confirmation is closely related to acetic acid. The combination of acetic acid with calcium and water, which are also omnipresent in the living nature, materializing as calcium acetate hemihydrate, was now revealed to exhibit a collagen like triple helix structure. This calcium salt is observed as efflorescence phase on calcareous heritage objects, like historic Mollusca shells, pottery or marble reliefs. In a model experiment pure calcium acetate hemihydrate was crystallized on the surface of a terracotta vessel. Calcium acetate hemihydrate crystallizes in a surprisingly large unit cell with a volume of 11,794.5(3) &#197;3 at ambient conditions. Acetate ions bridge neighboring calcium cations forming spiral chains, which are arranged in a triple helix motif.</dc:description>

      <title>The limited predictive power of the Pauling rules</title>
      <dc:description>The Pauling rules have been used for decades to rationalize the crystal structures of ionic compounds. Despite their importance, there has been so far no statistical assessment of the performances of these five empirical rules. Here, we test rigorously and automatically all five Pauling rules for a large data set of around 5000 known oxides. We discuss each Pauling rule separately stressing their limits and range of application in terms of chemistries and structures. We conclude that only 13% of the oxides simultaneously satisfy the last four rules, indicating their much lower predictive power than expected.</dc:description>

      <title>Solar&#8722;Powered Organic Semiconductor&#8722;Bacteria Biohybrids for CO2 Reduction into Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Photosynthetic biohybrid systems have emerged as a promising platform for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion by integrating excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability of semiconductors with the synthetic capability of biological cells. How to enhance the utilization of solar energy, hole/electron separation efficiency and the electron transfer between the semiconductor and biological cells is crucial to develop high&#8208;performance photosynthesis platforms. In this work, we developed an organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system, which could efficiently realize CO  2  reduction to produce acetic acid through non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria  Moorella thermoacetica  . As the photosensitizers, both cationic electron&#8208;transporting (  n  &#8208;type) perylene diimide derivative (PDI) and hole&#8208;transporting (  p  &#8208;type) poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) were coated on the bacteria surface to form  p  &#8208;  n  heterojunction (PFP/PDI) layer, affording higher hole/electron separation efficiency. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability and biocompatibility, and more importantly, the cationic side chains of organic semiconductors could intercalate into cell membrane, ensuring the efficient electron transfer to bacteria. As a result,  Moorella thermoacetica  can harvest photoexcited electrons from the PFP/PDI heterojunction, which can drive the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway to synthesize acetic acid from CO  2  under illumination. The efficiency of this organic biohybrid is &#8764; 1.6%, which is comparable to those of reported inorganic biohybrid systems. This work opens a new avenue to explore bioenergy application of organic semiconductors, and also provides a convenient biomanufacturing approach to design organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrids for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapd Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bisphosphine Derivatives through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Hydrophosphination</title>
      <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Bisphosphines have been identified as one class of important and powerful chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis with transition metals. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfides was developed with the assistance of &#8220;soft&#8208;soft interaction&#8221; between copper(I)&#8208;catalyst and the phosphine sulfide moiety, which afforded 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine derivatives with diversified electronic nature and steric hindrance in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, the challenging catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphination/protonation reaction was achieved with excellent enantioselectivity. Strikingly, the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic diarylphosphines was also successfully carried out with high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Interestingly, the nucleophilic copper(I)&#8208;diphenylphosphide species was characterized by  31  P NMR spectrum and mass spectrum. At last, three products were transformed to chiral 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines, which were employed as ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester. The &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative was produced in high enantioselectivity, which demonstrated the utility of the present methodology.</dc:description>

Selective consumption of the first RAFT agent is used to control the cationic RAFT polymerization of a vinyl ether monomer bearing a secondary dormant RAFT agent, which subsequently allows side&#8208;chain polymers to be grafted from the pendant RAFT agent by a radical&#8208;mediated RAFT polymerization of a different monomer, thus completing the synthesis of bottlebrush polymers.

      <title>Synthesis of Poly(Acyclic Orthoesters): Acid&#8208;Sensitive Biomaterials for Enhancing Immune Responses of Protein Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>While poly(acyclic orthoesters) (PAOEs) have many appealing features for drug delivery, their application is significantly hindered by a lack of facile synthetic method. Here we report a simple method for synthesizing acyclic diketene acetal monomers from diols and vinyl ether, and their polymerization with a diol to first synthesize PAOEs. The PAOEs rapidly hydrolyzed at lysosomal pH. With the help of a cationic lipid, ovalbumin, a model vaccine antigen, was efficiently loaded into PAOEs nanoparticles using a double emulsion method. These nanoparticles efficiently delivered ovalbumin into the cytosol of dendritic cells and demonstrated enhanced antigen presentation over PLGA nanoparticles. PAOEs are promising vehicles for intracellular delivery of biopharmaceuticals and could increase the utility of poly(orthoesters) in biomedical research.</dc:description>

Crystallographic analysis of 2&#8209;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes revealed that they occupy a novel chemical space, but at the same time resemble the fragment of  meta  &#8208;disubstituted benzenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of disulfide surrogate peptides incorporating large&#8208;span surrogate bridges through a native chemical ligation&#8208;assisted diaminodiacid strategy</title>
      <dc:description>The use of synthetic bridges as surrogates for disulfide bonds has emerged as a practical strategy to obviate the poor stability of some disulfide&#8208;containing peptides. However, peptides incorporating large&#8208;span synthetic bridges are still beyond the reach of existing methods. Here we report a native chemical ligation (NCL)&#8208;assisted diaminodiacid (DADA) strategy that enables the robust generation of disulfide surrogate peptides incorporating surrogate bridges up to 50 amino acids in length. This strategy provides access, for this first time, to some highly desirable but otherwise impossible&#8208;to&#8208;obtain disulfide surrogates of bioactive peptides, including &#956;&#8208;conotoxin KIIIA, a potent inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels. The bioactivities and structures of the synthetic disulfide surrogates were verified by voltage clamp assays, NMR, and X&#8208;ray crystallography; and stability studies established that the disulfide replacements effectively overcame the problems of disulfide reduction and scrambling that often plague these pharmacologically important peptides. By expanding access to structurally more diverse disulfide surrogate peptides, the NCL&#8208;assisted DADA strategy is expected to facilitate the development of peptide&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Weight Control via Cross Metathesis in Photo&#8208;Redox Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Photo&#8208;redox mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (photo&#8208;ROMP) is an emerging ROMP technique that uses an organic redox mediator and a vinyl ether initiator, in contrast to metal&#8208;based initiators traditionally used in ROMP. The reversibility of the redox&#8208;mediated initiation and propagation steps enable spatiotemporal control over the polymerization.

This method enables access to low molecular weight oligomers, and molecular weights between 1 and 30 kDa can be targeted simply by altering the stoichiometry of the reaction. This method of molecular weight control was then used to synthesize a functionalized norbornene copolymer in a range of molecular weights for specific materials applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmed Locomotion of an Active Gel Driven by Spiral Waves</title>
      <dc:description>Active media that host spiral waves can display complex modes of locomotion driven by the dynamics of those waves. We use a model of a photosensitive stimulus&#8208;responsive gel that supports the propagation of spiral chemical waves to study locomotive transition and programmed locomotion.

      <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>The field of electrochemical synthesis has developed rapidly over the last decade and provided alternative synthetic methods without using stoichiometric amounts of chemical oxidants or reductants.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The field of electrochemical synthesis has developed rapidly over the last decade and provided alternative synthetic methods without using stoichiometric amounts of chemical oxidants or reductants. Although sustainable procedures of electrosynthesis have been developed, relatively few examples of highly enantioselective catalytic electrosynthesis have been reported to date. The development of general strategies for electrochemical enantiocontrol has thus proven to be a considerable challenge. This Minireview highlights the current knowledge and recent advances emerging synthetic utility of electrochemical transformation in asymmetric synthesis.

      <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effect on Luminescence in Polymers: Advances and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>The crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect was first proposed to explore the strong luminescence of non&#8208;conjugated polymer dots only possessing either non&#8208; or weakly&#8208;emissive sub&#8208;luminophores. Interesting phenomena in recent research indicate such enhancement caused by extensive crosslinking appears in diverse luminescent polymers with sub&#8208;luminophores (electron&#8208;rich hetero&#8208;atomic moieties) or luminophores (conjugated &#960; domains). This enhancement can promote the emission from non&#8208;luminous to luminous, weakly&#8208;luminous to strongly&#8208;luminous and even converting the pathway of radiative transitions. The concept of the crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect should be updated and extended to an in&#8208;depth spatial effect, such as electron overlap and energy splitting in confined domains by effective crosslinking, more than initial immobilization. This minireview outlines the development of the crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect from the perspective of the detailed classification, inherent mechanism and applicable systems. An outlook on the further exploration and application of this theory are also proposed.</dc:description>

      <title>An Unprecedented Antimony(III) Borate with Strong Linear and Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
      <dc:description>Antimony(III) borates with stereochemical active lone pair remains a huge blank, despite that the first antimony borate has been reported for more than twenty years. Herein, we successfully synthesize the first antimony(III) borate in closed system, namely SbB  3  O  6  . Remarkably, SbB  3  O  6  not only exhibits an exceptional linear optical response, that is, birefringence of &#8710;  n  =0.290 at the wavelength of 546 nm, which is the largest among borates, but also has a strong nonlinear optical response of 3.5 times larger than the benchmark KH  2  PO  4  , which exceeds those of most borates. Theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of strong linear and nonlinear optical responses in SbB  3  O  6  should be attributable to the synergistic effect of  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated B&#8208;O anionic groups and Sb  3+  with stereochemical active lone pair.

      <dc:description>Lanthanide metal photocatalysis are much less investigated in synthetic chemistry compared to the rare and expensive late transition metals. Dearomative cycloaddition reactions with indoles, providing direct access to diverse heterocyclic compounds with increased topology, are of high relevance. We herein introduce a Gd(III) photocatalysis enabled, highly regioselective, intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition/ring&#8208;expansion sequence with indoles, which could provide divergent access to cyclopenta[  b  ]indoles and indolines. A simple and commercially available Gd(OTf)  3  salt is sufficient for this visible violet light induced transformation. The reaction proceeds either through a transient or start&#8208;to&#8208;end dearomatization cascade and shows excellent regioselectivity (usually &gt;95:5 r.r.), broad scope (59 examples), good functional group tolerance and facile scale&#8208;up under mild, direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation but external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal that direct excitation of the Gd(OTf)  3  /indole mixture gives an excited state intermediate, which undergoes the subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition and cyclobutane&#8208;expansion cascade.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of stereoselectivity in diverse hapalindole metabolites is mediated by cofactor induced combinatorial pairing of Stig cyclases</title>
      <dc:description>The stereospecific polycyclic core formation of hapalindoles and fischerindoles is controlled by the Stig cyclases through a three&#8208;step cascade involving Cope rearrangement, 6&#8208;  exo  &#8208;trig cyclization and a final electrophilic aromatic substitution.

By changing the blocks, variously functional units (naphthalene, pyrene, anthraquinone, porphyrin, et. al.) can be conveniently introduced into the backbone of macrocycles. Interestingly, the macrocyclization can be tuned by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. Linear (180  o  ) monomer yield cyclic trimers and pentamers, while V&#8208;shaped (120  o  , 90  o  and 60  o  ) monomers tend to form dimers.

      <dc:description>
The selective N&#8208;acylation of glucosamine with unprotected carboxylic acids enables the biosynthesis of unnatural glycosides and their subsequent enzymatic modification. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914338), L. Liu, S.&#8197;L. Flitsch, J.

This selective N&#8208;acylation step provides the last missing link for the fully enzymatic multistep synthesis of C5&#8208;modified sialosides from chitin.

      <title>The Ultimate Method for the Programmed Synthesis of Mutifunctional Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrroles from aldehydes, primary amines, nitriles and diethyl oxalacetate has been developed. It is now possible to prepare diketopyrrolopyrroles bearing an ordered arrangement of three different substituents from abundant and commercially available materials allowing the independent regulation of all desired physicochemical properties. For the first time very electron&#8208;rich (carbazo&#8208;3&#8208;yl, dimethylaminophenyl, pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;  b  ]pyrrolyl) and sterically hindered substituents (naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl, quinolin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, acridin&#8208;9&#8208;yl, imidazo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;yl, 2&#8208;bromophenyl, etc.) can be appended to the diketopyrrolopyrrole core  via  condensation of an appropriate nitrile with a pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. Even greater synthetic possibilities are related to the fact that such demanding substituents as 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl, indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl and 2&#8208;methoxyphenyl can be incorporated from aldehyde precursors, bypassing problems with the nitriles reactivity. Starting from terephthaldehyde, previously inaccessible bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrroles can also be obtained. The ability to incorporate an unprecedented variety of substituents translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties such as shifting the absorption and emission across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching the highest recorded Stokes shift for a diketopyrrolopyrrole (5800 cm  &#8722;1  ) and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism.</dc:description>

      <title>A Hydrolase&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Forms the Fused Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactone in Vibralactone</title>
      <dc:description>Vibralactone is isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Boreostereum vibrans  as one of the strongest lipase inhibitors. Its unusual &#946;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused bicycle is derived from an aryl ring moiety via an oxidative ring&#8208;expansion prior to an intramolecular cyclization. Here, we report the discovery of the cyclase VibC which belongs to the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase superfamily and is involved in the vibralactone biosynthesis. Biochemical and crystal studies suggest that VibC may catalyze an aldol or an electrocyclic reaction initiated by the catalytic Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp triad. For the aldol and pericyclic chemistry in living cells, VibC is a unique hydrolase performing the carbocycle formation of an oxepinone to a fused bicyclic b&#8208;lactone. This presents a naturally occurring new enzyme reaction in both aldol and hydrolase (bio)chemistry that will guide future exploitation of these enzymes in synthetic biology for chemical diversity expansion of natural products.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Gold(I)  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au(I)&#8208;NHC) complexes have emerged as a new generation of potential anticancer agents due to their impressively high cytotoxicity and stability. Integration of their above unique functions with customized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens to achieve specific bioimaging and efficient theranostics to cancer is highly desirable but is rarely studied. In this work, we have developed a series of novel Au(I)&#8208;NHC compounds with AIE characteristics. Through systematic biological evaluation and comparison, complex  1  with triphenyl phosphine ligand was selected out as it could achieve both prominent specific imaging of various cancer cells and efficient inhibition of their growth with negligible toxic effects on normal cells due to the targeting binding and strong inhibition towards thioredoxin reductase. Complex  1  could also act as a powerful radiosensitizers to boost the anticancer efficacy with performance superior to that of popularly used auranofin. Thus, complex  1  holds great potential as a specific and effective theranostic drug in cancer diagnosis and precise therapy. The present work is anticipated to open a new avenue to the development of novel Au&#8208;based bioprobes and drug candidates.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of organosilanes (RxSiH4&#8208;x) under formation of Si&#8211;Si bonds is an intensively investigated process leading to oligo&#8208; or polysilanes.

New low valent nickel hydride complexes are used as catalysts and secondary silanes, RR&#8217;SiH2, are obtained as products in high purity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The glutathione/metallothionein system challenges the design of efficient O2&#8208;activating Cu&#8208;complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Copper&#8208;complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs designed to cleave intracellular biomolecules  via  O  2  activation. To exhibit such activity, the copper complex must be redox&#8208;active and resistant to dissociation. Metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are abundant in the cytosol and nucleus. Because they also are thiol&#8208;rich reducing molecules with high Cu  I  &#8208;affinity, they are potential competitors for copper ion bound in a copper drug. Here, we investigated a panel of Cu  I  / Cu  II  &#8208;complexes often used as drugs, from various classes, with diverse coordination chemistries and redox potentials. We evaluated their catalytic activity in ascorbate oxidation based on redox&#8208;cycling between Cu  I  and Cu  II  , as well as their resistance to dissociation or inactivation under cytosolically&#8208;relevant concentrations of GSH and MT. Our findings show that O  2  &#8208;activating Cu  I  / Cu  II  &#8208;complexes for cytosolic/nuclear targets are generally not stable against the GSH/MT system, which creates a challenge for their future design.</dc:description>

      <title>A Universal Strategy toward Ultrasmall Hollow Nanostructures with Remarkable Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Hollow nanostructures have shown enormous potentials in many fields, but the convenient synthesis of ultrasmall hollow nanostructures with a wide range of compositions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report a facile and versatile microwave&#8208;assisted and shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy to fabricate a variety of ultrasmall hollow nanoparticles by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene. Unlike traditional thermal treat route, our method involves that the adsorption of microwave by graphene creates a high&#8208;energy environment in a short time to decompose the in&#8208;situ grown MOF nanocrystals into well&#8208;dispersed uniform core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with ultrasmall size rather than large aggregated particles. Upon a newly disclosed shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion process, a series of hollow nanoparticles of multi&#8208;metal oxides, phosphides, and sulfides with the diameter below 20 nm and shell thickness below 3 nm can be successfully obtained for the first time. We further revealed that ultrasmall hollow nanostructure such as Fe  2  O  3  can promote much faster charge transport and expose more active sites as well as migrate the volume change stress more efficiently than the solid and large hollow counterparts, thus demonstrating remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage performance including ultrahigh reversible capacity (1167 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  ), excellent rate performance (701 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ) and outstanding cycling stability (97.8% after 1200 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ), which is among the best results reported so far. This study provides an exciting way to design hollow nanostructured functional materials for electrochemical energy storage and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Native S&#8208;Palmitoylated Membrane Proteins through Removable&#8208;Backbone&#8208;Modification&#8208;Assisted Ser/Thr Ligation</title>
      <dc:description>
Native proteins by non&#8208;native methods: An RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL strategy (removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted serine/threonine ligation) was developed for the chemical synthesis of native S&#8208;palmitoylated membrane proteins, which have not previously been accessible through chemical synthesis. The successful synthesis of S&#8208;palmitoylated sarcolipin and M2 demonstrates the importance of non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.







Abstract
The preparation of native S&#8208;palmitoylated (S&#8208;palm) membrane proteins is one of the unsolved challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, we report the first chemical synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins by removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted Ser/Thr ligation (RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL). This method involves two critical steps: 1)&#8197;synthesis of S&#8208;palm peptides by a new &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid based RBM (RBMGABA) strategy, and 2)&#8197;ligation of the S&#8208;palm RBM&#8208;modified peptides to give the desired S&#8208;palm product by the STL method. The utility of the RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL method was demonstrated by the synthesis of rabbit S&#8208;palm sarcolipin (SLN) and S&#8208;palm matrix&#8208;2 (M2) ion channel. The synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins highlights the importance of developing non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.

In this process an &#945;&#8208;amino acid transaminase, an &#945;&#8208;keto acid methyltransferase and a halide methyltransferase cooperate in two orthogonal reaction cycles that mediate product formation and regeneration of the cofactor pyridoxal&#8208;5'&#8208;phosphate and the co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosylmethionine. The only stoichiometric reagents consumed in this process are the unprotected L&#8208; or D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid and methyl iodide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Verwey&#8208;Type Transition in Iron Oxide, Fe5O6</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with an unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry was synthesized by S.&#8197;V. Ovsyannikov et&#8197;al., as reported in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914988). Near 275&#8197;K, the material undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for use in innovative applications.

      <title>A Glutathione Activatable Ion Channel Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells by Depleting Intracellular Glutathione Levels</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic Cancer cells use elevated glutathione (GSH) levels as an inner line of defense to evade apoptosis and develop drug resistance. In this study, we describe a novel 2,4&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNS) protected 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide system that exploits GSH for its activation into free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide forming supramolecular M+/Cl&#8210;  channels. Better permeation of the DNS protected compound into MCF&#8208;7 cells compared to the free 2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide and GSH&#8208;activatable ion transport resulted in higher cytotoxicity, which was associated with increased oxidative stress that further reduced the intracellular GSH levels and altered mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The GSH&#8208;activatable transport&#8208;mediated cell death was further validated in rat insulinoma cells (INS&#8208;1E); wherein the intracellular GSH levels showed a direct correlation to the resulting cytotoxicity. Lastly, the active compound was found to restrict the growth and proliferation of 3D spheroids of MCF&#8208;7 cells with efficiency similar to that of the anticancer drug doxorubicin.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We have proposed a label&#8208;free method for measuring intracellular temperature using a Raman image of a cell in the O&#8208;H stretching band. Raman spectra of cultured cells and the medium were first measured at various temperatures using a Raman microscope and the intensity ratio of the two regions of the O&#8208;H stretching band was calculated. The intensity ratio varies linearly with temperature in both the medium and cells, and the resulting calibration line allows simultaneous visualization of both intracellular and extracellular temperatures in a label&#8208;free manner. We applied this method to the measurement of temperature changes after the introduction of FCCP (carbonyl cyanide&#8208;  p  &#8208;trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) in living cells. We observed a temperature rise in the cytoplasm and succeeded in obtaining an image of the change in intracellular temperature after the FCCP treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Polarity Umpolung Strategy for the Radical Alkylation of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Free radical&#8208;mediated alkylation of general alkenes is a challenging and largely unmet goal. Herein, we disclose a conceptually novel &#8220;polarity umpolung&#8221; strategy for radical alkylation of alkenes using a portfolio of easily&#8208;accessed, dual&#8208;function alkylating reagents. This is achieved by substituting inherently nucleophilic alkyl radicals with electrophilic sulfone&#8208;decorated surrogates, thus inverting the usual mode of reactivity. Along with alkylation, an extra heteroaryl or oximino group is concurrently incorporated into alkenes via consecutive docking and migration process, leading to valuable products. The reaction displays a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.</dc:description>

Herein, we disclose a conceptually novel &#8220;polarity umpolung&#8221; strategy for radical alkylation of alkenes using a portfolio of easily&#8208;accessed, dual&#8208;function alkylating reagents. This is achieved by substituting inherently nucleophilic alkyl radicals with electrophilic sulfone&#8208;decorated surrogates, thus inverting the usual mode of reactivity. Along with alkylation, an extra heteroaryl or oximino group is concurrently incorporated into alkenes via consecutive docking and migration process, leading to valuable products. The reaction displays a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The protocol opens new vistas for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and drug molecules containing alkene moieties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An &#951;3&#8208;Bound Allyl Ligand on Magnesium in a Mechanochemically Generated Mg/K Allyl Complex</title>

      <title>A Facile and Versatile Synthesis of End&#8208;Functionalized Poly(phenylacetylene)s: A Multicomponent Catalytic System for Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes</title>
      <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system for well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of phenylacetylenes has been developed. The catalytic system is composed of easily available and bench&#8208;stable [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, aryl boronic acid derivatives, diphenylacetylene, 50% aq KOH, and PPh3. This system offers a method for facile and versatile synthesis of various end&#8208;functionalized  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s because components from aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylene were introduced to the initiating end of the polymers. The polymerization reaction shows a typical living nature with a high initiation efficiency, and the molecular weight of the resulting poly(phenylacetylene)s can be easily controlled with very narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn  = 1.02&#8211;1.09). The experimental facts suggest that the present catalytic system has the higher polymerization activity than the polymerization activities of other rhodium&#8208;based catalytic systems previously reported.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We achieved concise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;enriched graphene for battery applications. The direct treatment of graphene oxide (GO) with commercially available Lawesson&#8217;s reagent produced sulfur&#8208;enriched&#8208;reduced GO (S&#8208;rGO).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that POM clusters were individually immobilized on the S&#8208;rGO surface. This battery based on a POM/S&#8208;rGO complex exhibited greater cycling stability for the charge&#8211;discharge process than a battery with nanohybrid materials positioned between the POM and non&#8208;enriched rGO. Our results demonstrate that the use of sulfur&#8208;containing groups on a graphene surface can be extended to applications such as the catalysis of electrochemical reactions and electrodes in other battery systems.</dc:description>

Abstract
We report a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available acrylamide derivatives and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides a rapid route to a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines. The regioselectivity of the reaction with unactivated terminal alkene is significantly improved by using Cpt ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The synthetic utility of the reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of a potential drug candidate containing a trisubstituted piperidine moiety. Mechanistic studies show that the reversibility of the C&#8722;H activation depends on the choice of Cp ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The irreversible C&#8722;H activation is observed and becomes turnover&#8208;limiting with [CptRhCl2]2 as catalyst.

      <title>An Unexpected Transannular [4+2] Cycloaddition during the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Norcembrene&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
They may look alike&#8230; During studies toward the total synthesis of the norditerpene natural product norcembrene&#8197;5, one diastereomer of a key intermediate (&#945;&#8208;OAc at C13) underwent clean and spontaneous Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition at room temperature (see scheme). However, the corresponding &#946;&#8197;isomer did not undergo a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but was oxidized to the corresponding furanone, which was further transformed into norcembrene&#8197;5.







Abstract
We report a concise and versatile total synthesis of the diterpenoid (+)&#8208;norcembrene&#8197;5 from simple building blocks. Ring&#8208;closing metathesis and an auxiliary&#8208;directed 1,4&#8208;addition are the key steps of our synthetic route. During the synthesis, an unprecedented, highly oxidized pentacyclic structural motif was established from a furanocembranoid through transannular [4+2] cycloaddition.

      <title>A Supramolecular Stabilizer of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction with a Synergistic Mode of Action</title>
      <dc:description>
A stabilizer of the interaction between the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), a driver in the majority of breast cancers, and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;, a negative regulator of ER&#945;, is developed as anti&#8208;cancer strategy. The stabilizer of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms and stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A.







Abstract
We report on a stabilizer of the interaction between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; and the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;). ER&#945; is a driver in the majority of breast cancers and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins are negative regulators of this nuclear receptor, making the stabilization of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) an interesting strategy. The stabilizer (1) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms containing an arginine mimetic, previously described as the GCP motif. 1 stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A and was thus hypothesized to bind to a different site. This is supported by computational analysis of 1 binding to the binary complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived phosphopeptide. Furthermore, 1 shows selectivity towards 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction over other 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client&#8208;derived phosphomotifs. These data provide a solid support of a new binding mode for a supramolecular 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; PPI stabilizer.

      <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Approach for the Detection of Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 in Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing of COX&#8208;2: An isoform&#8208;selective fluorogenic probe reports on enzymatic activity within live cells. A two&#8208;step activation facilitates the release of the natural product and resorufin for confocal imaging and flow cytometry. CoxFluor indicates that COX&#8208;2 activity can be regulated by oxygen without a change in the protein expression level.







Abstract
Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) overexpression is prominent in inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Directly monitoring COX&#8208;2 activity within its native environment poses an exciting approach to account for and illuminate the effect of the local environments on protein activity. Herein, we report the development of CoxFluor, the first activity&#8208;based sensing approach for monitoring COX&#8208;2 within live cells with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. CoxFluor strategically links a natural substrate with a dye precursor to engage both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of COX&#8208;2. This catalyzes the release of resorufin and the natural product, as supported by molecular dynamics and ensemble docking. CoxFluor enabled the detection of oxygen&#8208;dependent changes in COX&#8208;2 activity that are independent of protein expression within live macrophage cells.

      <title>Structure Selectivity of Alkaline Periodate Oxidation on Lignocellulose for Facile Isolation of Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure based: A novel method based on a recyclable and newly selective alkaline periodate oxidation at pH&#8197;10 provides a sustainable strategy for the efficient isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from various lignocellulosic materials. Isolation of the CNCs results from the structural differences between the ordered and non&#8208;ordered regions of the lignocellulose.







Abstract
Reported here for the first time is the alkaline periodate oxidation of lignocelluloses for the selective isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). With the high concentrations as a potassium salt at pH&#8197;10, periodate ions predominantly exist as dimeric orthoperiodate ions (H2I2O104&#8722;). With reduced oxidizing activity in alkaline solutions, dimeric orthoperiodate ions preferentially oxidized non&#8208;ordered cellulose regions. The alkaline surroundings promoted the degradation of these oxidized cellulose chains by &#946;&#8208;alkoxy fragmentation and generated CNCs. The obtained CNCs were uniform in size and generally contained carboxy groups. Furthermore, the reaction solution could be reused after regeneration of the periodate with ozone gas. This method allows direct production of CNCs from diverse sources, in particular lignocellulosic raw materials including sawdust (European beech and Scots pine), flax, and kenaf, in addition to microcrystalline cellulose and pulp.

      <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective cobalt and nickel single&#8208;atom catalysts were developed and applied as electrocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction. In their Communication on page&#8197;3033, S.

      <title>Polymer Nanocontainers for Intracellular Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Special delivery: Carrier systems for intracellular delivery are required to overcome limitations of therapeutic agents. Nanocontainers comprised of an aqueous core and a polymer shell offer the possibility of stimuli&#8208;responsive payload release and surface modification to enhance local selectivity. This Minireview considers the synthesis and properties of polymer nanocontainers for intracellular delivery.







Abstract
Carriers for intracellular delivery are required to overcome limitations of therapeutic agents such as low specificity, systemic toxicity, high clearance rate, and low therapeutic index. Nanocontainers comprised of an aqueous core and a polymer shell have received increasing attention because they readily combine stimuli response to improve intracellular payload release and surface modification to enhance selectivity towards the desired region of action. This Minireview summarizes the design and properties of polymer nanocontainers for intracellular delivery, classified according to the polymer architecture.

      <title>Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Performance enhancers: Electrolytes for Li&#8211;air batteries include non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, and hybrid electrolytes. This Review shows the importance of electrolytes to the mechanisms and performance of lithium&#8211;air batteries and provides a basis for selecting suitable electrolytes. The existing challenges, solutions, as well as guidance for the future direction of this field are also considered.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;air batteries are promising devices for electrochemical energy storage because of their ultrahigh energy density. However, it is still challenging to achieve practical Li&#8211;air batteries because of their severe capacity fading and poor rate capability. Electrolytes are the prime suspects for cell failure. In this Review, we focus on the opportunities and challenges of electrolytes for rechargeable Li&#8211;air batteries. A detailed summary of the reaction mechanisms, internal compositions, instability factors, selection criteria, and design ideas of the considered electrolytes is provided to obtain appropriate strategies to meet the battery requirements. In particular, ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes and solid&#8208;state electrolytes show exciting opportunities to control both the high energy density and safety.

      <title>Synthetic Applications of Oxidative Aromatic Coupling&#8212;From Biphenols to Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Coupling up: The dehydrogenative coupling of arenes is an ultimate example of C&#8722;H activation. This Review highlights the most exciting examples of the Scholl reaction, ranging from the synthesis of biphenols through natural products to nanographenes and on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation reported since 2013.







Abstract
Oxidative aromatic coupling occupies a fundamental place in the modern chemistry of aromatic compounds. It is a method of choice for the assembly of large and bewildering architectures. Considerable effort was also devoted to applications of the Scholl reaction for the synthesis of chiral biphenols and natural products. The ability to form biaryl linkages without any prefunctionalization provides an efficient pathway to many complex structures. Although the chemistry of this process is only now becoming fully understood, this reaction continues to both fascinate and challenge researchers. This is especially true for heterocoupling, that is, oxidative aromatic coupling with the chemoselective formation of a C&#8722;C bond between two different arenes. Analysis of the progress achieved in this field since 2013 reveals that many groups have contributed by pushing the boundary of structural possibilities, expanding into surface&#8208;assisted (cyclo)dehydrogenation, and developing new reagents.

      <title>Amperometric Measurements and Dynamic Models Reveal a Mechanism for How Zinc Alters Neurotransmitter Release</title>
      <dc:description>
From dense core to halo: Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using TEM was combined with monitoring and modelling single&#8208;cell amperometric responses to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to explain the regulation mechanism of synaptic plasticity by Zn2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.







Abstract
Zinc, a suspected potentiator of learning and memory, is shown to affect exocytotic release and storage in neurotransmitter&#8208;containing vesicles. Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using transmission electron microscopy was combined with single&#8208;cell amperometry to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to compare these changes to theoretical predictions based on the concept of partial release as opposed to full quantal release. This powerful combined analytical approach establishes the existence of an unsuspected strong link between vesicle structure and exocytotic dynamics, which can be used to explain the mechanism of regulation of synaptic plasticity by Zn2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.

      <title>Coupling of Solar Energy and Thermal Energy for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Status and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
A bundle of energy: The coupling of solar energy and thermal energy is a promising strategy to mediate the activity and/or selectivity of CO2 reduction. The status and prospects of this topic are reviewed, with the aim of providing guidelines for the design of new catalysts.







Abstract
Enormous efforts have been devoted to the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) by utilizing various driving forces, such as heat, electricity, and radiation. However, the efficient reduction of CO2 is still challenging because of sluggish kinetics. Recent pioneering studies from several groups, including us, have demonstrated that the coupling of solar energy and thermal energy offers a novel and promising strategy to promote the activity and/or manipulate selectivity in CO2 reduction. Herein, we clarify the definition and principles of coupling solar energy and thermal energy, and comprehensively review the status and prospects of CO2 reduction by coupling solar energy and thermal energy. Catalyst design, reactor configuration, photo&#8208;mediated activity/selectivity, and mechanism studies in photo&#8208;thermo CO2 reduction will be emphasized. The aim of this Review is to promote understanding towards CO2 activation and provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts for the efficient reduction of CO2.

      <title>Deracemization Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited deracemization: Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been utilized to convert racemates into single enantiomers in the presence of a chiral photosensitizer or a pair of chiral catalysts. Mechanistic studies revealed that energy transfer (EnT) or a sequence of electron transfer (ET), proton transfer (PT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is operative.







Abstract
Deracemization is an ideal but challenging strategy for the conversion of a racemic mixture into a single enantiomer. Recent studies have demonstrated that visible&#8208;light photocatalysis could be utilized to promote selective deracemization of axially chiral allenes as well as cyclopropylquinolones and cyclic ureas with central chirality either through energy transfer or through a sequence of electron, proton, and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

      <title>A Convergent Total Synthesis of the Death Cap Toxin &#945;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A new route to the toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is presented. The key steps of the convergent [5+1+2]&#8208;synthesis are the preformation of the thioether building block and access to the enantiomerically pure non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on a multigram scale. The peptide fragment based methodology is the first convergent &#945;&#8208;amanitin synthesis fully performed in solution phase.







Abstract
The toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is mostly found in different species of the mushroom genus Amanita, with the death cap (Amanita phalloides) as one of the most prominent members. Due to its high selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II, which is directly linked to its high toxicity, particularly to hepatocytes, &#945;&#8208;amanitin received an increased attention as a toxin&#8208;component of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADC) in cancer research. Furthermore, the isolation of &#945;&#8208;amanitin from mushrooms as the sole source severely restricts compound supply as well as further investigations, as structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Based on a straightforward access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid dihydroxyisoleucine, we herein present a robust total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amanitin providing options for production at larger scale as well as future structural diversifications.
