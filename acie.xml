      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 2&#8208;Amidoacrylates</title>
      <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant nickel, coordinated with a suitable bisphosphine ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;amidoacrylates, affording the chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee). The active catalyst component was studied by NMR and HRMS, which helped us to realize high catalytic efficiencyon a gram scale hydrogenation with a low catalyst loading (S/C=2000). The hydrogenated products could be simply converted to chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, and their bioactive derivatives. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was investigated using deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and computational calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Integrating Allyl Electrophiles into Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Conjunctive Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Allylation and conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling represent two useful, yet largely distinct, reactivity paradigms in catalysis. The union of these two processes would offer exciting possibilities in organic synthesis but remains largely unknown. Herein, we report the use of allyl electrophiles in nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling with a non&#8208;conjugated alkene and dimethylzinc. The transformation is enabled by weakly coordinating, monodentate azaheterocycle directing groups, that useful building blocks in synthesis, including saccharin, pyridones, pyrazoles, and triazoles. The reaction occurs under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of allyl electrophiles. High chemoselectivity through substrate directivity is demonstrated in the facile reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;&#947; alkene of the starting material, while the &#949;&#8208;&#950; alkene of the product is preserved. The generality of this approach is further illustrated through the development of analogous method with alkyne substrates. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of the weakly coordinating directing group in dissociating to allow binding of the allyl moiety to facilitate C(sp  3  )&#8211;C(sp  3  ) reductive elimination.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A chiral electrochemically responsive molecular universal joint (EMUJ) was synthesized by fusing a macrocyclic pillar[6]arene (P[6]) to a ferrocene&#8208;based side ring.

      <title>Photo&#8208;driven active ion transport through a Janus microporous membrane</title>
      <dc:description>The accurate control of ion transport is a fundamental characteristic for the sustainability of life. Toward practical and high&#8208;performance artificial ion transport system, attaining active transport of ions (protons) in an all&#8208;solid state nanoporous material remains a great challenge.

Analogously to the p&#8208;n junction in photovoltaic devices, light is firstly converted into separated charges to trigger a transmembrane potential, which subsequently drives directional ion movement. For the first time, this method enables integration of the photovoltaic effect with the ionic field to drive active ion transport.

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis of Aromatic &#946;&#8208;Ketoester in Situ toward Transient and Persistent Radicals for Organic Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Radical formation is an initial step for conventional radical chemistry. Reported herein is a unified strategy to generate radicals  in situ  from aromatic  &#946;  &#8208;ketoester only by a photocatalyst. Under visible light irradiation, a small amount of photocatalyst  fac  &#8208;Ir(ppy)  3  succeeds in the generation of transient  &#945;  &#8208;carbonyl radical and persistent ketyl radical  in situ  , for the first time. In contrast to the well&#8208;established approaches, neither stoichiometric external oxidant nor reductant is required for this reaction. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by pinacol&#8208;coupling of ketyl radicals and benzannulation of  &#945;  &#8208;carbonyl radicals with alkynes to give a series of highly substituted 1&#8208;naphthols in good to excellent yields. Provided the readily available photocatalyst, extremely mild reaction condition, broad substrate scope and functionality tolerance offer a unique perspective in synthetic planning and implementation.</dc:description>

The synthetic utility is demonstrated by pinacol&#8208;coupling of ketyl radicals and benzannulation of  &#945;  &#8208;carbonyl radicals with alkynes to give a series of highly substituted 1&#8208;naphthols in good to excellent yields. Provided the readily available photocatalyst, extremely mild reaction condition, broad substrate scope and functionality tolerance offer a unique perspective in synthetic planning and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tunable Surface Wrinkling via Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyamine&#8208;Anion Coacervation Process Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>We demonstrate a bio&#8208;inspired method to render controlled wrinkling surface patterns on supramolecular architectures assembled from polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. It involves polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction generating positively charged coacervates, which while dictating the assembly of POM into spherical structures, further facilitate an interesting surface morphogenesis with wrinkling patterns. This spontaneous surface wrinkling depends on the type of multivalent anion and the pH. Particularly, as the polyamine&#8208;anion interaction becomes stronger, the wrinkles turn denser with lesser depth, which eventually undergoes post&#8208;buckling to engender a complex surface pattern. Interestingly, the order of influence exerted by different anions on the morphology follows the Hofmeister series clearly reflecting the versatiltiy of the method. Further, the mild synthesis conditions keep the the functional POM units dipersed in the sphere with a structural transformability to their lacunary form. Therefore, the presented method is believed to aid in creating exotic surface patterns from various functional units for advanced applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Photoenzymatic Cascades to Synthesize Long Chain Aliphatic Amines and Esters from Renewable Fatty Acids</title>
      <dc:description>Long chain aliphatic amines such as ( S,Z  )&#8208;heptadec&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;amine and 9&#8208;aminoheptadecane were synthesized from ricinoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively, by whole&#8208;cell cascade reactions using the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Micrococcus luteus  , an engineered amine transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis  (Vf&#8208;ATA), and a photoactivated decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis  NC64A (Cv&#8208;FAP) in a one&#8208;pot process. In addition, long chain aliphatic esters such as 10&#8208;(heptanoyloxy)dec&#8208;8&#8208;ene and octylnonanoate were prepared from ricinoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively, by using the combination of the ADH, a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase variant from Pseudomonas putida  KT2440, and the Cv&#8208;FAP. The target compounds were produced at rates of up to 37 U/g dry cells with conversions up to 90%. Therefore, this study contributes to the preparation of industrially relevant long chain aliphatic chiral amines and esters from renewable fatty acid resources.</dc:description>

      <title>Cation Diffusion Guides Hybrid Halide Perovskite Crystallization during Gel Stage</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention to find their promising potential in various applications as optoelectronics. Unfortunately, this materials with mixed cations/anions often suffer from phase segregation, which is detrimental to the device efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. During perovskite film growth, the gel stage (in between liquid and crystalline) correlates to the phase segregation, which has been rarely explored. Herein, we systematically investigate the cation diffusion kinetics at the gel stage to develop a diffusion model obeying Fick&#8217;s Second Law. Take 2D layered perovskite as an example, we combine theoretical and experimental results to reveal the impacts of diffusion coefficient, temperature, and gel duration on the film growth and phase formation. In light of this finding, we successfully fabricate a homogenous 2D perovskite thin film without significant phase segregation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of gel stage and relevant cation diffusion kinetics would further guide the design and processing of halide perovskites with mixed composition to meet requirements for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Anchored mediator enabling shuttle&#8211;free redox mediation in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Redox mediators (RMs) are considered an effective countermeasure to reduce the large polarization in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient enhancement of the cyclability is limited by the trade&#8211;offs of freely mobile RMs, which are beneficial for charge transport but also trigger the shuttling phenomenon. Here, we successfully decoupled the charge&#8211;carrying redox property of RMs and shuttling phenomenon by anchoring the RMs in polymer form, where physical RM migration was replaced by charge transfer along polymer chains. Using a model system of a polymer, PTMA (2,2,6,6&#8211;tetramethyl&#8211;1&#8211;piperidinyloxy&#8211;4&#8211;yl methacrylate), based on the well&#8211;known RM tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), it is demonstrated that PTMA is capable of functioning as a stationary RM, preserving the redox activity of TEMPO. The efficiency of RM&#8211;mediated Li  2  O  2  decomposition remains remarkably stable without the consumption of oxidized RMs or degradation of the lithium anode, resulting in marked improvement of the performance of the lithium&#8211;oxygen cell.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The 60&#8208;year high  Bordetella pertussis  (  B. pertussis  ) infection rate in the world suggests the urgent need for new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccines. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of  B. pertussis  is an attractive antigen for vaccine development. With the presence of multiple rare sugars and unusual glycosyl linkages,  B. pertussis  LPS is a highly challenging synthetic target. In this work, aided by molecular dynamics simulation and modeling, the pertussis LPS like pentasaccharide was chemically synthesized for the first time. The pentasaccharide was conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946; as a vaccine candidate. Immunization of mice with the conjugate induced robust anti&#8208;glycan IgG responses with IgG titers reaching several million enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units. The antibodies generated were long lasting and boostable, and could recognize multiple clinical strains of  B. pertussis  , highlighting the potential of Q&#946;&#8208;glycan as a new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccine.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Cellular Biological Functions Through the Controlled Release of NO from a Porous Ti&#8208;MOF</title>
      <dc:description>Materials for the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO) are of interest for therapeutic applications. However, to date, many suffer from toxicity and stability issues, as well as poor performance. Herein, we propose a new NO adsorption/release mechanism through the formation of nitrites on the skeleton of a titanium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) that we have named MIP&#8208;177, featuring a suitable set of properties for such applications: (i) high NO storage capacity (3 &#181;mol mg  &#8208;1  solid  ), (ii) excellent biocompatibility at therapeutic relevant concentrations (no cytotoxicity at 90 &#181;g/mL for wound healing) due to its high stability in biological media (&lt; 9% degradation in 72 hours) and (iii) slow NO release in biological media (&#8275;2 hours for 90% release). The prospective application of MIP&#8208;177 is demonstrated through the NO&#8208;driven control of mitochondrial respiration in cells and the stimulation of cell migration, paving the way for the design of new NO delivery systems for wound healing therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;fouling Fluoropolymers for Bioconjugation and In Vivo Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>The conjugation of hydrophilic low&#8208;fouling polymers to therapeutic molecules and particles is an effective approach to improving their aqueous stability and solubility, and extending their pharmacokinetics. Recent concerns over the immunogenicity of poly(ethylene glycol) has highlighted the importance of identifying alternative low fouling polymers. Herein, we report a new class of synthetic water&#8208;soluble homo&#8208;fluoropolymers with a sulfoxide side&#8208;chain structure. The incorporation of fluorine enables direct imaging of the homopolymer by  19  F MRI, negating the need for additional synthetic steps to attach an imaging moiety.

      <title>Synthesis of Copper&#8208;Substituted CoS2@CuxS Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes by Sequential Ion Exchange for Efficient Sodium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Storage boxes: Copper&#8208;substituted CoS2@CuxS double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes were synthesized through a multistep metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based templating strategy (see picture). With their unique shell architecture and complex composition, these double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes exhibited enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, superior rate capability, and long cycle life.







Abstract
The construction of hybrid architectures for electrode materials has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to boost sodium&#8208;storage properties because of the synergetic effect of each component. However, the fabrication of hybrid nanostructures with a rational structure and desired composition for effective sodium storage is still challenging. In this study, an integrated nanostructure composed of copper&#8208;substituted CoS2@CuxS double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (denoted as Cu&#8208;CoS2@CuxS DSNBs) was synthesized through a rational metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based templating strategy. The unique shell configuration and complex composition endow the Cu&#8208;CoS2@CuxS DSNBs with enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of superior rate capability and stable cyclability.

      <title>A Multi&#8208;Wall Sn/SnO2@Carbon Hollow Nanofiber Anode Material for High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@carbon composite hollow nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning and carbonization reduction. They have solid wire core that is wrapped by a double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube. This wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube strategy perfectly combines high energy density and high cycling stability. It produces superior electrochemical performance, with a capacity of 986.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 508.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@carbon hollow nanofibers evolved from SnO2 nanofibers are designed and programable synthesized by electrospinning, polypyrrole coating, and annealing reduction. The synthesized hollow nanofibers have a special wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube structure with larger specific surface area and abundant inner spaces, which can provide effective contacting area of electrolyte with electrode materials and more active sites for redox reaction. It shows excellent cycling stability by virtue of effectively alleviating pulverization of tin&#8208;based electrode materials caused by volume expansion. Even after 2000 cycles, the wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube Sn/SnO2@carbon nanofibers exhibit a high specific capacity of 986.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and still maintains 508.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This outstanding electrochemical performance suggests the multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@ carbon hollow nanofibers are great promising for high performance energy storage systems.

The synthesized hollow nanofibers have a special wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube structure with larger specific surface area and abundant inner spaces, which can provide effective contacting area of electrolyte with electrode materials and more active sites for redox reaction. It shows excellent cycling stability by virtue of effectively alleviating pulverization of tin&#8208;based electrode materials caused by volume expansion. Even after 2000 cycles, the wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube Sn/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@carbon nanofibers exhibit a high specific capacity of 986.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and still maintains 508.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This outstanding electrochemical performance suggests the multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@ carbon hollow nanofibers are great promising for high performance energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multivariate Modulation of the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 for Defect&#8208;Controlled Multimodal Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as leading candidates for nanoscale drug delivery, as a consequence of their high drug capacities, ease of functionality, and the ability to carefully engineer key physical properties. Despite many anticancer treatment regimens consisting of a cocktail of different drugs, examples of delivery of multiple drugs from one MOF are rare, potentially hampered by difficulties in postsynthetic loading of more than one cargo molecule. Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination at the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Anchored mediator enabling shuttle&#8211;free redox mediation in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Redox mediators (RMs) are considered an effective countermeasure to reduce the large polarization in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient enhancement of the cyclability is limited by the trade&#8211;offs of freely mobile RMs, which are beneficial for charge transport but also trigger the shuttling phenomenon. Here, we successfully decoupled the charge&#8211;carrying redox property of RMs and shuttling phenomenon by anchoring the RMs in polymer form, where physical RM migration was replaced by charge transfer along polymer chains. Using a model system of a polymer, PTMA (2,2,6,6&#8211;tetramethyl&#8211;1&#8211;piperidinyloxy&#8211;4&#8211;yl methacrylate), based on the well&#8211;known RM tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), it is demonstrated that PTMA is capable of functioning as a stationary RM, preserving the redox activity of TEMPO. The efficiency of RM&#8211;mediated Li  2  O  2  decomposition remains remarkably stable without the consumption of oxidized RMs or degradation of the lithium anode, resulting in marked improvement of the performance of the lithium&#8211;oxygen cell.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation of Pertussis&#8208;Like Pentasaccharide Bearing Multiple Rare Sugars as a Potential Anti&#8208;pertussis Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>The 60&#8208;year high  Bordetella pertussis  (  B. pertussis  ) infection rate in the world suggests the urgent need for new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccines. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of  B. pertussis  is an attractive antigen for vaccine development. With the presence of multiple rare sugars and unusual glycosyl linkages,  B. pertussis  LPS is a highly challenging synthetic target. In this work, aided by molecular dynamics simulation and modeling, the pertussis LPS like pentasaccharide was chemically synthesized for the first time. The pentasaccharide was conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946; as a vaccine candidate. Immunization of mice with the conjugate induced robust anti&#8208;glycan IgG responses with IgG titers reaching several million enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units. The antibodies generated were long lasting and boostable, and could recognize multiple clinical strains of  B. pertussis  , highlighting the potential of Q&#946;&#8208;glycan as a new anti&#8208;pertussis vaccine.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Cellular Biological Functions Through the Controlled Release of NO from a Porous Ti&#8208;MOF</title>
      <dc:description>Materials for the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO) are of interest for therapeutic applications. However, to date, many suffer from toxicity and stability issues, as well as poor performance. Herein, we propose a new NO adsorption/release mechanism through the formation of nitrites on the skeleton of a titanium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) that we have named MIP&#8208;177, featuring a suitable set of properties for such applications: (i) high NO storage capacity (3 &#181;mol mg  &#8208;1  solid  ), (ii) excellent biocompatibility at therapeutic relevant concentrations (no cytotoxicity at 90 &#181;g/mL for wound healing) due to its high stability in biological media (&lt; 9% degradation in 72 hours) and (iii) slow NO release in biological media (&#8275;2 hours for 90% release). The prospective application of MIP&#8208;177 is demonstrated through the NO&#8208;driven control of mitochondrial respiration in cells and the stimulation of cell migration, paving the way for the design of new NO delivery systems for wound healing therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyhydrazide&#8208;based organic nanotubes as extremely efficient and highly selective artificial iodide channels</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a series of pore&#8208;containing polymeric nanotubes based on an H&#8208;bonded hydrazide backbone. Nanotubes of suitable lengths, possessing a hollow cavity of ~ 6.5 &#197; in diameter, are interestingly found to mediate highly efficient transport of diverse types of anions, rather than cations, across lipid membrane. Polymer channel  1a  , having an averaged molecular weight of 18.2 KDa and 3.6 nm in helical height, exhibits the highest anion transport activities with iodide (  EC  50  = 0.042 uM or 0.028 mol% relative to lipid) being transported 10 times more efficiently than chlorides (  EC  50  = 0.47 uM). Notably, even in cholesterol&#8208;rich environment, iodide transport activity still remains high with  EC  50  of 0.37 uM. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that the channel is highly selective for anions and that such anion selectivity arises from a positive electrostatic potential of the central lumen rendered by the interior&#8208;pointing methyl groups.</dc:description>

      <title>The crucial role of charge accumulation and spin polarization in activating carbon&#8208;based catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective carbon&#8208;based catalysts are promising for catalyzing electrochemical N  2  reduction reaction (NRR). However, the activity origin of carbon&#8208;based catalysts towards NRR remains unclear, and regularities and rules in rational design carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts are still lacking. Here, based on a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental observations, we systematically evaluated the chalcogen/oxygen group elements (O, S, Se, and Te) doped carbon materials as potential NRR catalysts. We revealed that heteroatom&#8208;doping induced charge accumulation facilitates N  2  adsorption on carbon atom and spin polarization boosts the potential&#8208;determining step of the first protonation to form *NNH. Te and Se&#8208;doped C catalysts exhibited high intrinsic NRR activity, superior to most of metal&#8208;based catalysts.

      <title>Oppositely Charged Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes with 2D Nanofluidic Channels for Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis (RED) is considered as the most promising technique to harvest osmotic energy. However, the traditional membranes are limited by the high internal resistance and low efficiency, resulting in undesirable power densities. Here, we report the combination of oppositely charged Ti  3  C  2  T  x  MXene membranes (MXMs) with confined 2D nanofluidic channels as high&#8208;performance osmotic power generators. The negatively or positively charged 2D MXene nanochannels exhibit typical surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport and show excellent cation or anion selectivity. By mixing the artificial sea water (0.5 M NaCl) and river water (0.01 M NaCl), we obtain a maximum power density of ~4.6 W m  &#8722;2  , higher than most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generators, and very close to the commercialization benchmark (5 W m  &#8722;2  ). Through connecting ten tandem MXM&#8208;RED stacks, the output voltage can reach up 1.66 V, which can directly power the electronic devices. This work signi&#64257;cantly expands possibilities for the application of MXMs in osmotic power generation, making this blue energy a tangible and promising alternative.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals &#8211; a Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8208;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>For in&#8208;situ resource utilization (ISRU), the cost&#8208;mass conundrum needs to be solved, before any other formidable challenges may be tackled. Technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals, rather than taking the most advanced technology of today. Using this approach, this paper seeks to provide a think tank about how chemical process intensification can help with technology and business case disruption of ISRU matters, how this might influence Space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and first of all even Earth&#8208;industry transformations. The disruptive technology considered is continuous micro&#8208;flow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids (instead of conventional organic solvents). The Space business considered is Asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction of the amount of process water used in the Asteroid mining process. This paper suggests a pathway toward water savings by orders of magnitude, up to the technological limit of best Earth&#8208;process intensification and their physical limits (e.g. of solubility). This is believed to provide a solution to a major economic bottleneck, whilst leaving many technology developments to be achieved before a holistic system and business picture can be given.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein, we report the molecular&#8208;level structuration of two full photosystems into conjugated porous organic polymers. The strategy of heterogenization gives rise to photosystems which are still fully active after 4 days of continuous illumination.

      <title>Probing long&#8208;range anisotropic interactions &#8211; A general and sign&#8208;sensitive strategy to measure 1H&#8208;1H residual dipolar couplings as a key advance for organic structure determination</title>
      <dc:description>Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are amongst the most powerful NMR parameters for organic structure elucidation. In order to maximize their effectiveness in increasingly complex cases such as flexible compounds, a maximum of RDCs between nuclei sampling a large distribution of orientations is needed, including sign information.

      <title>Low&#8208;fouling Fluoropolymers for Bioconjugation and In Vivo Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>The conjugation of hydrophilic low&#8208;fouling polymers to therapeutic molecules and particles is an effective approach to improving their aqueous stability and solubility, and extending their pharmacokinetics. Recent concerns over the immunogenicity of poly(ethylene glycol) has highlighted the importance of identifying alternative low fouling polymers. Herein, we report a new class of synthetic water&#8208;soluble homo&#8208;fluoropolymers with a sulfoxide side&#8208;chain structure. The incorporation of fluorine enables direct imaging of the homopolymer by  19  F MRI, negating the need for additional synthetic steps to attach an imaging moiety. These self&#8208;reporting fluoropolymers show outstanding imaging sensitivity and as such represent a new class of low&#8208;fouling polymer for bioconjugation and  in vivo  tracking.</dc:description>

      <title>Coenzymes and their role in the evolution of Life</title>
      <dc:description>The evolution of coenzymes, or the impact of coenzymes on the origin of Life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence and yet, this topic is rarely discussed in contemporary science. Coenzymes are small molecules that occupy an elementary role with respect to chemical reactivity and selectivity when associated with a macromolecular template. They are essential for functional biocatalysis in all living organisms and act as currency to regulate many basic metabolic processes. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have co&#8208;existed with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. Through this discussion, we hope to renew interest for understanding more about the origins of coenzymes, particularly those with a heterocyclic core, and their role as promoters and mediators in biocatalysis. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of Life.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation in Photoredox Catalysis: Concepts, Applications, Methods</title>
      <dc:description>The energy of visible photons and the accessible redox potentials of common photocatalysts set thermodynamic limits to photochemical reactions that can be driven by traditional visible&#8208;light irradiation. UV excitation can be damaging and induce side reactions, hence visible or even near&#8208;IR light is usually preferable. Thus, photochemistry currently faces two divergent challenges, namely the desire to perform ever more thermodynamically demanding reactions with increasingly lower photon energies.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
The construction of hybrid architectures for electrode materials has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to boost sodium&#8208;storage properties because of the synergetic effect of each component. However, the fabrication of hybrid nanostructures with a rational structure and desired composition for effective sodium storage is still challenging. In this study, an integrated nanostructure composed of copper&#8208;substituted CoS2@CuxS double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (denoted as Cu&#8208;CoS2@CuxS DSNBs) was synthesized through a rational metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based templating strategy. The unique shell configuration and complex composition endow the Cu&#8208;CoS2@CuxS DSNBs with enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of superior rate capability and stable cyclability.

Described herein are two different methods for the synthesis of vinyl halides by a shuttle catalysis based iridium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrohalogenation of unactivated alkynes. The use of 4&#8208;chlorobutan&#8208;2&#8208;one or tert&#8208;butyl halide as donors of hydrogen halides allows this transformation in the absence of corrosive reagents, such as hydrogen halides or acid chlorides, thus largely improving the functional&#8208;group tolerance and safety profile of these reactions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. This method has granted access to alkenyl halide compounds containing acid&#8208;sensitive groups, such as tertiary alcohols, silyl ethers, and acetals. The synthetic value of those methodologies has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis where low catalyst loading was achieved.

=======
&lt;p&gt;Described herein are two different methods for the synthesis of vinyl halides by a shuttle catalysis based iridium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrohalogenation of unactivated alkynes. The use of 4&#8208;chlorobutan&#8208;2&#8208;one or &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl halide as donors of hydrogen halides allows this transformation in the absence of corrosive reagents, such as hydrogen halides or acid chlorides, thus largely improving the functional&#8208;group tolerance and safety profile of these reactions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. This method has granted access to alkenyl halide compounds containing acid&#8208;sensitive groups, such as tertiary alcohols, silyl ethers, and acetals. The synthetic value of those methodologies has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis where low catalyst loading was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
Multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@carbon hollow nanofibers evolved from SnO2 nanofibers are designed and programable synthesized by electrospinning, polypyrrole coating, and annealing reduction. The synthesized hollow nanofibers have a special wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube structure with larger specific surface area and abundant inner spaces, which can provide effective contacting area of electrolyte with electrode materials and more active sites for redox reaction. It shows excellent cycling stability by virtue of effectively alleviating pulverization of tin&#8208;based electrode materials caused by volume expansion. Even after 2000 cycles, the wire&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;wall&#8208;tube Sn/SnO2@carbon nanofibers exhibit a high specific capacity of 986.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and still maintains 508.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This outstanding electrochemical performance suggests the multi&#8208;wall Sn/SnO2@ carbon hollow nanofibers are great promising for high performance energy storage systems.

      <title>Multivariate Modulation of the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 for Defect&#8208;Controlled Multimodal Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as leading candidates for nanoscale drug delivery, as a consequence of their high drug capacities, ease of functionality, and the ability to carefully engineer key physical properties. Despite many anticancer treatment regimens consisting of a cocktail of different drugs, examples of delivery of multiple drugs from one MOF are rare, potentially hampered by difficulties in postsynthetic loading of more than one cargo molecule. Herein, we report a new strategy, multivariate modulation, which allows incorporation of up to three drugs in the Zr MOF UiO&#8208;66 by defect&#8208;loading. The drugs are added to one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis and are distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination at the metal clusters. This tight binding comes with retention of crystallinity and porosity, allowing a fourth drug to be postsynthetically loaded into the MOFs to yield nanoparticles loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells in vitro. We believe that multivariate modulation is a significant advance in the application of MOFs in biomedicine, and anticipate the protocol will also be adopted in other areas of MOF chemistry, to easily produce defective MOFs with arrays of highly functionalised pores for potential application in gas separations and catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>The crucial role of charge accumulation and spin polarization in activating carbon&#8208;based catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective carbon&#8208;based catalysts are promising for catalyzing electrochemical N  2  reduction reaction (NRR). However, the activity origin of carbon&#8208;based catalysts towards NRR remains unclear, and regularities and rules in rational design carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts are still lacking. Here, based on a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental observations, we systematically evaluated the chalcogen/oxygen group elements (O, S, Se, and Te) doped carbon materials as potential NRR catalysts. We revealed that heteroatom&#8208;doping induced charge accumulation facilitates N  2  adsorption on carbon atom and spin polarization boosts the potential&#8208;determining step of the first protonation to form *NNH. Te and Se&#8208;doped C catalysts exhibited high intrinsic NRR activity, superior to most of metal&#8208;based catalysts. The establishing of the correlation between the electronic structure and NRR performance for carbon&#8208;based materials paves the pathway for their NRR application.</dc:description>

Te and Se&#8208;doped C catalysts exhibited high intrinsic NRR activity, superior to most of metal&#8208;based catalysts. The establishing of the correlation between the electronic structure and NRR performance for carbon&#8208;based materials paves the pathway for their NRR application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Oppositely Charged Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes with 2D Nanofluidic Channels for Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis (RED) is considered as the most promising technique to harvest osmotic energy. However, the traditional membranes are limited by the high internal resistance and low efficiency, resulting in undesirable power densities. Here, we report the combination of oppositely charged Ti  3  C  2  T  x  MXene membranes (MXMs) with confined 2D nanofluidic channels as high&#8208;performance osmotic power generators. The negatively or positively charged 2D MXene nanochannels exhibit typical surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport and show excellent cation or anion selectivity. By mixing the artificial sea water (0.5 M NaCl) and river water (0.01 M NaCl), we obtain a maximum power density of ~4.6 W m  &#8722;2  , higher than most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generators, and very close to the commercialization benchmark (5 W m  &#8722;2  ). Through connecting ten tandem MXM&#8208;RED stacks, the output voltage can reach up 1.66 V, which can directly power the electronic devices. This work signi&#64257;cantly expands possibilities for the application of MXMs in osmotic power generation, making this blue energy a tangible and promising alternative.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals &#8211; a Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8208;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>For in&#8208;situ resource utilization (ISRU), the cost&#8208;mass conundrum needs to be solved, before any other formidable challenges may be tackled. Technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals, rather than taking the most advanced technology of today. Using this approach, this paper seeks to provide a think tank about how chemical process intensification can help with technology and business case disruption of ISRU matters, how this might influence Space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and first of all even Earth&#8208;industry transformations. The disruptive technology considered is continuous micro&#8208;flow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids (instead of conventional organic solvents). The Space business considered is Asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction of the amount of process water used in the Asteroid mining process. This paper suggests a pathway toward water savings by orders of magnitude, up to the technological limit of best Earth&#8208;process intensification and their physical limits (e.g. of solubility). This is believed to provide a solution to a major economic bottleneck, whilst leaving many technology developments to be achieved before a holistic system and business picture can be given.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are amongst the most powerful NMR parameters for organic structure elucidation. In order to maximize their effectiveness in increasingly complex cases such as flexible compounds, a maximum of RDCs between nuclei sampling a large distribution of orientations is needed, including sign information.

      <title>Coenzymes and their role in the evolution of Life</title>
      <dc:description>The evolution of coenzymes, or the impact of coenzymes on the origin of Life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence and yet, this topic is rarely discussed in contemporary science. Coenzymes are small molecules that occupy an elementary role with respect to chemical reactivity and selectivity when associated with a macromolecular template. They are essential for functional biocatalysis in all living organisms and act as currency to regulate many basic metabolic processes. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have co&#8208;existed with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. Through this discussion, we hope to renew interest for understanding more about the origins of coenzymes, particularly those with a heterocyclic core, and their role as promoters and mediators in biocatalysis. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of Life.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The energy of visible photons and the accessible redox potentials of common photocatalysts set thermodynamic limits to photochemical reactions that can be driven by traditional visible&#8208;light irradiation. UV excitation can be damaging and induce side reactions, hence visible or even near&#8208;IR light is usually preferable. Thus, photochemistry currently faces two divergent challenges, namely the desire to perform ever more thermodynamically demanding reactions with increasingly lower photon energies.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
Described herein are two different methods for the synthesis of vinyl halides by a shuttle catalysis based iridium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrohalogenation of unactivated alkynes. The use of 4&#8208;chlorobutan&#8208;2&#8208;one or tert&#8208;butyl halide as donors of hydrogen halides allows this transformation in the absence of corrosive reagents, such as hydrogen halides or acid chlorides, thus largely improving the functional&#8208;group tolerance and safety profile of these reactions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. This method has granted access to alkenyl halide compounds containing acid&#8208;sensitive groups, such as tertiary alcohols, silyl ethers, and acetals. The synthetic value of those methodologies has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis where low catalyst loading was achieved.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
Nickela&#8208;electrooxidative C&#8722;H alkoxylations with challenging secondary alcohols were accomplished in a fully dehydrogenative fashion, thereby avoiding stoichiometric chemical oxidants, with H2 as the only stoichiometric byproduct. The nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed oxygenation proved viable with various (hetero)arenes, including naturally occurring secondary alcohols, without racemization. Detailed mechanistic investigation, including DFT calculations and cyclovoltammetric studies of a well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activated nickel(III) intermediate, suggest an oxidation&#8208;induced reductive elimination at nickel(III).

Polyphosphate (PolyP) is one of the most compact inorganic polyanionic biopolymers that participates in various physiological processes. However, the mechanism of the interaction between polyP and proteins remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that polyP can interact with positively charged green fluorescent protein, +36GFP, resulting in liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) by intermolecular electrostatic interactions in cells. Upon nutrient deprivation, genetically engineered Citrobacter freundii accumulates intracellular polyP at a rate of 210&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1, resulting in the compartmentation of +36GFP at the cell poles within 1&#8197;h. Medium chain&#8208;length polyP (60&#8208;mer) could induce the formation of +36GFP coacervates in&#8197;vitro at a protein concentration as low as 200&#8197;nm, which is of the same magnitude as native proteins. In contrast, shorter polyP (14&#8208;mer) could not induce LLPS under the same conditions. This may offer a general approach to manipulate protein&#8211;protein interactions through LLPS.

A 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;MOF) was formed on a Cu(111) substrate using benzenehexol molecules. By means of a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory, the structure of the 2D&#8208;MOF is determined to be Cu3(C6O6), which is stabilized by O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bonding motifs. We find that upon adsorption on Cu(111), the 2D&#8208;MOF features a semiconductor band structure with a direct band gap of 1.5&#8197;eV. The O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bonds offer efficient charge delocalization, which gives rise to a highly dispersive conduction band with an effective mass of 0.45&#8197;me at the band bottom, implying a high electron mobility in this material.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
Polyphosphate (PolyP) is one of the most compact inorganic polyanionic biopolymers that participates in various physiological processes. However, the mechanism of the interaction between polyP and proteins remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that polyP can interact with positively charged green fluorescent protein, +36GFP, resulting in liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) by intermolecular electrostatic interactions in cells. Upon nutrient deprivation, genetically engineered Citrobacter freundii accumulates intracellular polyP at a rate of 210&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1, resulting in the compartmentation of +36GFP at the cell poles within 1&#8197;h. Medium chain&#8208;length polyP (60&#8208;mer) could induce the formation of +36GFP coacervates in&#8197;vitro at a protein concentration as low as 200&#8197;nm, which is of the same magnitude as native proteins. In contrast, shorter polyP (14&#8208;mer) could not induce LLPS under the same conditions. This may offer a general approach to manipulate protein&#8211;protein interactions through LLPS.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
A 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;MOF) was formed on a Cu(111) substrate using benzenehexol molecules. By means of a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory, the structure of the 2D&#8208;MOF is determined to be Cu3(C6O6), which is stabilized by O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bonding motifs. We find that upon adsorption on Cu(111), the 2D&#8208;MOF features a semiconductor band structure with a direct band gap of 1.5&#8197;eV. The O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bonds offer efficient charge delocalization, which gives rise to a highly dispersive conduction band with an effective mass of 0.45&#8197;me at the band bottom, implying a high electron mobility in this material.

The experimental investigation of intermolecular charge transport in &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials is challenging. Herein, we describe the investigation of charge transport through intermolecular and intramolecular paths in single&#8208;molecule and single&#8208;stacking thiophene junctions by the mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique. We found that the ability for intermolecular charge transport through different single&#8208;stacking junctions was approximately independent of the molecular structure, which contrasts with the strong length dependence of conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions with the same building blocks, and the dominant charge&#8208;transport path of molecules with two anchors transited from an intramolecular to an intermolecular path when the degree of conjugation increased. An increase in conjugation further led to higher binding probability owing to the variation in binding energies, as supported by DFT calculations.

New symmetric and unsymmetric B,N,B&#8208;doped benzo[4]helicenes 3&#8211;6&#8201;a/b have been achieved in good yields, using a three&#8208;step process, starting from N(tolyl)3 in a highly divergent manner (7 examples). A borinic acid functionalized 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;anthracene 1 was found to display unprecedented reactivity, acting as a convenient and highly effective precursor for selective formation of bromo&#8208;substituted B,N,B&#8208;benzo[4]helicenes 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b via intramolecular borylation and sequential B&#8722;Mes bond cleavage in the presence of BBr3. Subsequent reaction of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with Ar&#8208;Li provided a highly effective toolbox for the preparation of symmetrically/unsymmetrically functionalized B,N,B&#8208;helicenes. Their high photoluminescence quantum yields along with the small &#916;EST suggest their potential as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

&lt;p&gt;A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of spiro compounds from 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ols mediated by hypervalent iodine is reported. In this reaction, an unprecedented &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination of tertiary alkoxyliodine(III) to form new diaryliodonium salts is proposed. The obtained phenol intermediates undergo oxidative dearomatization to furnish a class of oxo&#8208;spiro compounds. This domino reaction significantly increases the complexity of these molecules and shows excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

Which mode of transport? The conductance of thiophene&#8208;based single&#8208;stacking junctions was found to be nearly independent of the conjugation pattern of the molecular structure. When the length of the conjugated region increased, there was a change in the dominant charge&#8208;transport path from intramolecular to intermolecular (see picture).

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
The experimental investigation of intermolecular charge transport in &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials is challenging. Herein, we describe the investigation of charge transport through intermolecular and intramolecular paths in single&#8208;molecule and single&#8208;stacking thiophene junctions by the mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique. We found that the ability for intermolecular charge transport through different single&#8208;stacking junctions was approximately independent of the molecular structure, which contrasts with the strong length dependence of conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions with the same building blocks, and the dominant charge&#8208;transport path of molecules with two anchors transited from an intramolecular to an intermolecular path when the degree of conjugation increased. An increase in conjugation further led to higher binding probability owing to the variation in binding energies, as supported by DFT calculations.

The design and scalable synthesis of robust 2D biological ultrathin films with a tunable structure and function and the ability to be easily transferred to a range of substrates remain key challenges in chemistry and materials science. Herein, we report the use of the thiol&#8211;disulfide exchange reaction in the synthesis of a macroscopic 2D ultrathin proteinaceous film with the potential for large&#8208;scale fabrication and on&#8208;demand encapsulation/release of functional molecules. The reaction between the Cys6&#8211;Cys127 disulfide bond of lysozyme and cysteine is chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective. The partially unfolded lysozyme&#8211;cysteine monomers aggregate at the air/water or solid/liquid interface to form an ultra&#8208;large 2D nanofilm (900&#8197;cm2) with about 100&#8201;% optical transparency. This material adheres to a wide range of substrates and encapsulates and releases a range of molecules without significantly affecting activity.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Crystalline Boragermenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A boragermene&lt;/b&gt; featuring a double bond between the germanium and boron atoms has been isolated for the first time from a cyclic (alkyl)(boryl)germylene&#8211;PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complex. This compound readily reacts with the Lewis base &lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;NHC to form the corresponding adduct on the boron center, and also undergoes hydrogenation with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Ge=B bond.
=======
The aminoazanium of DABCO (H2N&#8208;DABCO) has been developed as a general and practical amination reagent for the direct amination of alkyl and aryl pinacol boronates. This compound is stable and practical for use as a reagent. Various primary, secondary. and tertiary alkyl&#8722;Bpin and aryl&#8722;Bpin substrates were aminated to give the corresponding amine derivatives. The amination is stereospecific. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of olefins was easily achieved by catalytic hydroboration with HBpin and in subsequent situ amination using H2N&#8208;DABCO. Moreover, the combination of 1,2&#8208;diboration of olefins, using B2pin2, with this amination process achieved the unprecedented 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins. The amination protocol was also successfully extended to aryl pinacol boronates.

&lt;p&gt;Boragermene &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; featuring a double bond between the Ge and dicoordinate B atoms has been synthesized for the first time by reacting the cyclic (alkyl)(boryl)germylene&#8211;PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adduct &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BN(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; followed by reductive dehalogenation with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
The design and scalable synthesis of robust 2D biological ultrathin films with a tunable structure and function and the ability to be easily transferred to a range of substrates remain key challenges in chemistry and materials science. Herein, we report the use of the thiol&#8211;disulfide exchange reaction in the synthesis of a macroscopic 2D ultrathin proteinaceous film with the potential for large&#8208;scale fabrication and on&#8208;demand encapsulation/release of functional molecules. The reaction between the Cys6&#8211;Cys127 disulfide bond of lysozyme and cysteine is chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective. The partially unfolded lysozyme&#8211;cysteine monomers aggregate at the air/water or solid/liquid interface to form an ultra&#8208;large 2D nanofilm (900&#8197;cm2) with about 100&#8201;% optical transparency. This material adheres to a wide range of substrates and encapsulates and releases a range of molecules without significantly affecting activity.

Pathogenesis hallmarks for tuberculosis (TB) are the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) escape from phagolysosomal destruction and limited drug delivery into infected cells. Several nanomaterials can be entrapped in lysosomes, but the development of functional nanomaterials to promote phagolysosomal Mtb clearance remains a big challenge. Here, we report on the bactericidal effects of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) against Mtb and further introduce a novel nanomaterial&#8208;assisted anti&#8208;TB strategy manipulating Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs for synergistic drug&#8208;induced and phagolysosomal destruction of Mtb. Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs preferentially entered macrophages and accumulated in lysosomes releasing Isoniazid. Surprisingly, Ison@Man&#8208;Se/Man&#8208;Se NPs further promoted the fusion of Mtb into lysosomes for synergistic lysosomal and Isoniazid destruction of Mtb. Concurrently, Ison@Man&#8208;Se/Man&#8208;Se NPs also induced autophagy sequestration of Mtb, evolving into lysosome&#8208;associated autophagosomal Mtb degradation linked to ROS&#8208;mitochondrial and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. This novel nanomaterial&#8208;assisted anti&#8208;TB strategy manipulating antimicrobial immunity and Mtb clearance may potentially serve in more effective therapeutics against TB and drug&#8208;resistant TB.

We demonstrate controlled charge trapping and release, accompanied by multiple color changes in a metallo&#8208;organic bilayer. The dual functionality of the metallo&#8208;organic materials provides fundamental insight into the metal&#8208;mediated electron transport pathways. The electrochemical processes are visualized by distinct, four color&#8208;to&#8208;color transitions: red, transparent, orange, and brown. The bilayer is composed of two elements: 1)&#8197;a nanoscale gate consisting of a layer of well&#8208;defined polypyridyl ruthenium complexes bound to a flexible transparent electrode, and 2)&#8197;a charge storage layer consisting of isostructural iron complexes attached to the surface of the gate. This gate mediates or blocks electron transport in response to an applied voltage. The charge storage and release depend on the oxidation state of the layer of ruthenium complexes (=gate). Combining electrochemistry with optical data revealed mechanistic information: the brown coloration of the bilayer directly relates to the formation of intermediate ruthenium species, providing evidence for catalytic positive charge release mediated through the gate.

Abstract
<<<<<<< HEAD
Pathogenesis hallmarks for tuberculosis (TB) are the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) escape from phagolysosomal destruction and limited drug delivery into infected cells. Several nanomaterials can be entrapped in lysosomes, but the development of functional nanomaterials to promote phagolysosomal Mtb clearance remains a big challenge. Here, we report on the bactericidal effects of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) against Mtb and further introduce a novel nanomaterial&#8208;assisted anti&#8208;TB strategy manipulating Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs for synergistic drug&#8208;induced and phagolysosomal destruction of Mtb. Ison@Man&#8208;Se NPs preferentially entered macrophages and accumulated in lysosomes releasing Isoniazid. Surprisingly, Ison@Man&#8208;Se/Man&#8208;Se NPs further promoted the fusion of Mtb into lysosomes for synergistic lysosomal and Isoniazid destruction of Mtb. Concurrently, Ison@Man&#8208;Se/Man&#8208;Se NPs also induced autophagy sequestration of Mtb, evolving into lysosome&#8208;associated autophagosomal Mtb degradation linked to ROS&#8208;mitochondrial and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. This novel nanomaterial&#8208;assisted anti&#8208;TB strategy manipulating antimicrobial immunity and Mtb clearance may potentially serve in more effective therapeutics against TB and drug&#8208;resistant TB.

Structural proteomics refers to large&#8208;scale mapping of protein structures in order to understand the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function. Chemical labeling, in combination with mass&#8208;spectrometry (MS) analysis, have emerged as powerful tools to enable a broad range of biological applications in structural proteomics. The key to success is a biocompatible reagent that modifies a protein without affecting its high&#8208;order structure. Fluorine, well&#8208;known to exert profound effects on the physical and chemical properties of reagents, should have an impact on structural proteomics. In this Minireview, we describe several fluorine&#8208;containing reagents that can be applied in structural proteomics. We organize their applications around four MS&#8208;based techniques: a)&#8197;affinity labeling, b)&#8197;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP), c)&#8197;protein footprinting, and d)&#8197;protein cross&#8208;linking. Our aim is to provide an overview of the research, development, and application of fluorine&#8208;containing reagents in protein structural studies.

The coat of many colors: Colorful coatings can be obtained by arresting electrical charge. A nanoscale bilayer consisting of different metal complexes was used to demonstrate both charge trapping and release correlated with multicolored electrochromism.







Abstract
We demonstrate controlled charge trapping and release, accompanied by multiple color changes in a metallo&#8208;organic bilayer. The dual functionality of the metallo&#8208;organic materials provides fundamental insight into the metal&#8208;mediated electron transport pathways. The electrochemical processes are visualized by distinct, four color&#8208;to&#8208;color transitions: red, transparent, orange, and brown. The bilayer is composed of two elements: 1)&#8197;a nanoscale gate consisting of a layer of well&#8208;defined polypyridyl ruthenium complexes bound to a flexible transparent electrode, and 2)&#8197;a charge storage layer consisting of isostructural iron complexes attached to the surface of the gate. This gate mediates or blocks electron transport in response to an applied voltage. The charge storage and release depend on the oxidation state of the layer of ruthenium complexes (=gate). Combining electrochemistry with optical data revealed mechanistic information: the brown coloration of the bilayer directly relates to the formation of intermediate ruthenium species, providing evidence for catalytic positive charge release mediated through the gate.

      <dc:description>Making use of the programmability and structural flexibility of the DNA molecule, we designed a DNA origami nanoarm capable of undergoing large deformation. Our DNA origami nanoarm comprised serially repeated tension&#8208;adjustable modules, the cumulative actuation of which resulted in a large deformation of the arm structure, which transformed from a linear shape into an arched shape. Combining atomic force microscopy imaging and theoretical analyses based on the mechanics of materials, we demonstrate that the degree of deformation can be systematically controlled by merely replacing a set of strands that is required for the actuation of the module. Moreover, by employing a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence for the actuation, we could achieve reversible ion&#8208;induced contraction and relaxation of the nanoarm.

      <title>Electrochemiluminescence Waveguide in Single Crystalline Molecular Wires</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the first observation of active waveguide of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in single crystalline molecular wires self&#8208;assembled from cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, namely tris(1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline&#8208;C2,N  ) (Ir(piq)3). Under dark conditions, the molecular wires deposited on the electrode surface can act as both ECL emitters and active waveguides. As revealed by ECL microscopy, the molecular wires exhibit the typical characteristics of optical waveguides, transmitting ECL and generating much brighter ECL emission at their terminals. Moreover, self&#8208;generated ECL can be confined inside the molecular wire and propagate along the longitudinal direction as far as &#8764;100 &#956;m to the terminal out of touch with the electrode. Therefore, this one&#8208;dimensional crystalline molecular wire&#8208;based waveguide offers the opportunity to switch the electrochemically generated ECL to remote light emission in non&#8208;conductive regions and is highly promising for contactless electrochemical analysis and study of (bio)chemical systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Large deformation of a DNA origami nanoarm through the cumulative actuation of tension&#8208;adjustable modules</title>
      <dc:description>Making use of the programmability and structural flexibility of the DNA molecule, we designed a DNA origami nanoarm capable of undergoing large deformation. Our DNA origami nanoarm comprised serially repeated tension&#8208;adjustable modules, the cumulative actuation of which resulted in a large deformation of the arm structure, which transformed from a linear shape into an arched shape. Combining atomic force microscopy imaging and theoretical analyses based on the mechanics of materials, we demonstrate that the degree of deformation can be systematically controlled by merely replacing a set of strands that is required for the actuation of the module. Moreover, by employing a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence for the actuation, we could achieve reversible ion&#8208;induced contraction and relaxation of the nanoarm. The adjustability and scalability of our design, thus, provide a versatile design of DNA nanodevices that exhibit large deformation in response to external stimuli.</dc:description>

      <title>Triple Helix Stabilizing Effects in Collagen Model Peptides
Containing PPII Helix&#8208;Preorganized Diproline Modules</title>
      <dc:description>Collagen model peptides (CMPs) serve as tools for under&#173;standing stability and function of the collagen triple helix and have a potential for biomedical applications. In the past, inter&#8208;strand cross&#8208;linking or conformational preconditioning of proline units through stereoelectronic effects have been utilized in the design of stabilized CMPs. To further study the effects determining collagen triple helix stability we investigated a series of CMPs containing synthetic diproline&#8208;mimicking modules (ProMs), which are preorganized in a PPII helix&#8208;type conformation by a functionalizable intra&#8208;strand C2&#8208;bridge. Results of CD&#8208;based denaturation studies were correlated with calculated (DFT) conformational preferences of the ProM units revealing that the relative helix stability is mainly governed by an interplay of main chain preorganization, ring flip preference, adaptability and steric effects. Triple helix integrity was proven by crystal structure analysis and binding to HSP47.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Lithium ion capacitor (LIC) has attracted tremendous research interest, because it meets both the requirement on high energy and power densities. The balance between effective surface areas and mass transport is highly desired to fabricate the optimized electrode material for LIC. In this paper, triple&#8208;shelled (3S) Nb  2  O  5  hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) were synthesized for the first time through the sequential templating approach and then applied for the anode of LIC. The unique structure of HoMS, such as large efficient surface area, hierarchical pores, and multiple shells, provides abundant reaction sites, decreases the electron transport resistance and increases the diffusion rate for ion transport. In this case, the best combination performance has been achieved among all the reported Nb  2  O  5  &#8208;based materials, which delivered an excellent energy and power densities simultaneously, and superb cycling stability.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Reconstruction of Hierarchical Sn&#8208;Cu/SnOx Core/Shell Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) into valuable C  1  (formate and CO) products has been identified as one of the most techno&#8208;economically achievable strategies for alleviating CO  2  emissions. However,   high C  1  Faradaic efficiency and stability are generally attained at high overpotential and low current density. Herein, we demonstrate that the SnO  x  shell in Sn  2.7  Cu catalyst with hierarchical Sn&#8208;Cu core can be in situ reconstructed under cathodic potentials of CO  2  RR. The resulting Sn  2.7  Cu catalyst achieves a high current density of 406.7&#177;14.4 mA cm  &#8211;2  with C  1  Faradaic efficiency of 98.0&#177;0.9% at &#8211;0.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and remains stable at 243.1&#177;19.2 mA cm  &#8211;2  with C  1  Faradaic efficiency of 99.0&#177;0.5% for 40 h at &#8211;0.55 V vs. RHE. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the in situ reconstructed Sn/SnO  x  interface facilitates formic acid production by optimizing the binding of the reaction intermediate HCOO* while promotes Faradaic efficiency of C  1  products by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in high Faradaic efficiency, current density and stability of CO  2  RR at low overpotentials.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable polymer nanoparticles with exceptionally high drug loading by sequential nanoprecipitation</title>
      <dc:description>Poor solubility often leads to low drug efficacy. Encapsulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in polymeric nanoparticles offers a solution. However, low drug loading remains a critical challenge. Here, we report a simple and robust sequential nanoprecipitation technology to produce stable drug&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles with high drug loading (up to 58.5%) from a wide range of polymers and drugs. This technology is based on tuning the precipitation time of drugs and polymers using a solvent system comprising multiple organic solvents, which allows the formation of drug nanoparticles first followed by immediate precipitation of one or two polymers. This technology offers a new strategy to manufacture polymeric nanoparticles with high drug loading having good long&#8208;term stability and programmed release, and opens a unique opportunity for drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Bioinspired Nitroalkylation for Selective Protein Modification and Peptide Stapling</title>
      <dc:description>
Tagged: Reported is a bioinspired nitroalkylation strategy for chemoselective modification of proteins that mimics a key post&#8208;translational modification (PTM). A variety of different tags are installed on proteins rapidly and with high conversions (99&#8201;%) under mild reaction conditions. The nitro&#8208;peptide conjugates provide a handle for site&#8208;selective fluorination of peptides. This strategy is applied for the stapling of peptides.







Abstract
Nitroalkanes react specifically with aldehydes, providing rapid, stable, and chemoselective protein bioconjugation. These nitroalkylated proteins mimic key post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins and can be used to understand the role of these PTMs in cellular processes. Demonstrated here is the substrate scope of this bioconjugation by attaching a variety of tags, such as NMR tags, fluorescent tags, affinity tags, and alkyne tags, to proteins. The structure and enzymatic activity of modified proteins remain conserved after labeling. Notably, the nitroalkane group leads to easy characterization of proteins by mass spectrometry because of its distinct fingerprint pattern. Importantly, the nitro&#8208;alkylated peptides provide a new handle for site&#8208;selective fluorination of peptides, thus installing a specific probe to study peptide&#8211;protein interactions by 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, nitroalkane reagents can be used for the late&#8208;stage diversification of peptides and for the synthesis of peptide staples.

      <title>Photoswitchable Sol&#8211;Gel Transitions and Catalysis Mediated by Polymer Networks with Coumarin&#8208;Decorated Cu24L24 Metal&#8211;Organic Cages as Junctions
</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymer metal&#8211;organic cage (polyMOC) gels with Cu24L24 cuboctahedral junctions featuring a high density of coumarin ligands were prepared. These robust, dynamic materials could be reversibly switched between CuII, CuI, and Cu0 states, each with distinct mechanical, optical, and catalytic properties. In particular, the CuI state was used to catalyze covalent network formation, providing novel polyMOC covalent double networks.







Abstract
Photoresponsive materials that change in response to light have been studied for a range of applications. These materials are often metastable during irradiation, returning to their pre&#8208;irradiated state after removal of the light source. Herein, we report a polymer gel comprising poly(ethylene glycol) star polymers linked by Cu24L24 metal&#8211;organic cages/polyhedra (MOCs) with coumarin ligands. In the presence of UV light, a photosensitizer, and a hydrogen donor, this &#8220;polyMOC&#8221; material can be reversibly switched between CuII, CuI, and Cu0. The instability of the MOC junctions in the CuI and Cu0 states leads to network disassembly, forming CuI/Cu0 solutions, respectively, that are stable until re&#8208;oxidation to CuII and supramolecular gelation. This reversible disassembly of the polyMOC network can occur in the presence of a fixed covalent second network generated in&#8197;situ by copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), providing interpenetrating supramolecular and covalent networks.

Unprotected aldoses in water undergo an isomerization reaction via a radical pathway when irradiated with light in the presence of water&#8208;soluble benzophenone.

      <dc:description>The stereoselective formation of 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosidic bonds is challenging. However, 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;selectivity can be induced by remote participation of C4 or C6 ester groups.

      <title>Designing 0D/2D S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction over Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Inactivation of Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing heterojunctions between two semiconductors with matched band structure is one of the most effective strategies to acquire high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. S&#8208;scheme heterojunction system, as an innovative photocatalytic system, has shown great potential in facilitating separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, as well as acquiring strong photoredox ability. Herein, a 0D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material involving CeO 2  quantum dots and polymeric carbon nitride (CeO 2  /PCN) is designed and constructed via in&#8208;situ wet chemistry with subsequent heat treatment. This S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material shows high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1%) towards Staphylococcus Aureus (S.aureus) under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &#8805; 420 nm), which is 2.7 and 8.2 times that of pure CeO 2  (32.2%) and PCN (10.7%), respectively. Strong evidence of S&#8208;scheme charge transfer path is verified by theoretical calculation, in&#8208;situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI&#8208;XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. This work provides a robust way for tailoring the performance and interpreting the mechanism of heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system for high&#8208;performance photocatalysis.</dc:description>

This S&#8208;scheme heterojunction material shows high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1%) towards Staphylococcus Aureus (S.aureus) under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &#8805; 420 nm), which is 2.7 and 8.2 times that of pure CeO 2  (32.2%) and PCN (10.7%), respectively. Strong evidence of S&#8208;scheme charge transfer path is verified by theoretical calculation, in&#8208;situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI&#8208;XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. This work provides a robust way for tailoring the performance and interpreting the mechanism of heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system for high&#8208;performance photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multicomponent Peptide Stapling as a Diversity&#8208;Driven Tool for the Development of Inhibitors of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Stapled peptides are chemical entities in&#8208;between biologics and small molecules, which have proven to be the solution to high affinity protein&#8208;protein interaction antagonism while keeping control over pharmacological performance such as stability and membrane penetration. We demonstrate that the multicomponent reaction&#8208;based stapling is an effective strategy for the development of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides with highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53. Such a potent inhibitory activity of p53&#8208;MDM2/X interactions was assessed by fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis and 2D NMR, while several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained. This MCR stapling protocol proved efficient and versatile in terms of diversity generation at the staple, as evidenced by the incorporation of both  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;cyclic hydrophobic moieties at the side chain cross&#8208;linkers. The interaction of the Ugi&#8208;staple fragments with the target protein was demonstrated by crystallography, while the difference in ring sizes, flexibility and number of amide bonds within the ring seem to be crucial for a potent activity.</dc:description>

      <title>9,9&#8208;Dimethylxanthene Derivatives: New RTP Family Member and the Adjustable Performance through Substituent Effect</title>
      <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters with ultralong lifetime are emerging as attractive concern due to the potential applications in bioimaging, security and other areas. But their development is limited by ambiguous mechanism and unregulated RTP property with molecular design. In this text, with the incorporation of different substituents to 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene core, RTP lifetime of resultant compounds can increase from 52 to 601 ms by the tunable intermolecular interactions and molecular configurations. The most persistent RTP of compound XCO&#8208;PiCl is mainly due to the little steric hindrance and multiple sites of 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl moiety to form the strong intermolecular interactions in the aggregated states, which can be applied into bioimaging.

      <title>Luminescent Tetradentate Gold(III)&#8208;TADF Emitters: Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis and High Performance OLEDs With EQEs Up To 25 % and Long Operational Lifetime</title>
      <dc:description>Structurally robust tetradentate gold(III)&#8208;emitters have potent material applications but are rare and unprecedented for those displaying thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this work, a novel synthetic route leading to the preparation of highly emissive, charge&#8208;neutral tetradentate [C^C^N^C] gold(III) complexes with 5&#8208;5&#8208;6 membered chelate rings has been developed through microwave&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H bond activation. These complexes show high thermal stability and with emission origin (  3  IL,  3  ILCT and TADF) tuned by varying the substituents of the C^C^N^C ligand. With phenoxazine/diphenylamine substituent, we prepared the first tetradentate gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters with emission quantum yields of up to 94 % and emission lifetimes of down to 0.62 &#181;s in deoxygenated toluene. These tetradentate Au  III  &#8208;TADF emitters showed good performance in vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs with maximum EQEs of up to 25 % and LT  95  of up to 5280 h at 100 cd m  &#8208;2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Multicomponent Peptide Stapling as a Diversity&#8208;Driven Tool for the Development of Inhibitors of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Stapled peptides are chemical entities in&#8208;between biologics and small molecules, which have proven to be the solution to high affinity protein&#8208;protein interaction antagonism while keeping control over pharmacological performance such as stability and membrane penetration. We demonstrate that the multicomponent reaction&#8208;based stapling is an effective strategy for the development of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides with highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53. Such a potent inhibitory activity of p53&#8208;MDM2/X interactions was assessed by fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis and 2D NMR, while several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained. This MCR stapling protocol proved efficient and versatile in terms of diversity generation at the staple, as evidenced by the incorporation of both  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;cyclic hydrophobic moieties at the side chain cross&#8208;linkers. The interaction of the Ugi&#8208;staple fragments with the target protein was demonstrated by crystallography, while the difference in ring sizes, flexibility and number of amide bonds within the ring seem to be crucial for a potent activity.</dc:description>

      <title>9,9&#8208;Dimethylxanthene Derivatives: New RTP Family Member and the Adjustable Performance through Substituent Effect</title>
      <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters with ultralong lifetime are emerging as attractive concern due to the potential applications in bioimaging, security and other areas. But their development is limited by ambiguous mechanism and unregulated RTP property with molecular design. In this text, with the incorporation of different substituents to 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene core, RTP lifetime of resultant compounds can increase from 52 to 601 ms by the tunable intermolecular interactions and molecular configurations. The most persistent RTP of compound XCO&#8208;PiCl is mainly due to the little steric hindrance and multiple sites of 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl moiety to form the strong intermolecular interactions in the aggregated states, which can be applied into bioimaging. This substituent effect afforded an efficient strategy to molecular design of organic RTP materials with the deep understanding of the relationship among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions and RTP property.</dc:description>

These complexes show high thermal stability and with emission origin (  3  IL,  3  ILCT and TADF) tuned by varying the substituents of the C^C^N^C ligand. With phenoxazine/diphenylamine substituent, we prepared the first tetradentate gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters with emission quantum yields of up to 94 % and emission lifetimes of down to 0.62 &#181;s in deoxygenated toluene.

      <title>Achieving Efficient Multichannel Conductance in Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Single&#8208;Molecule Parallel Circuits</title>
      <dc:description>According to Landauer&#8217;s theory, constructing single&#8208;molecule parallel circuits with multiple conducting channels is an effective strategy to improve conductance of a single molecular junction. However, the reports on single&#8208;molecule parallel circuits are extremely rare. Herein, we report a novel through&#8208;space conjugated single&#8208;molecule parallel circuit (  f  &#8208;4Ph&#8208;4SMe) comprised of a pair of closely parallel aligned  p  &#8208;quaterphenyl chains tethered by a vinyl bridge and end&#8208;capped with four methylmercapto (SMe) anchors. Scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;based break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique and transmission calculation demonstrate that  f  &#8208;4Ph&#8208;4SMe holds multiple conductance states owing to different contact configurations. When four SMe groups contact with two electrodes at the same time, the through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space conducting channels function synergistically, resulting in much larger conductance than those of analogous molecules with two SMe anchors as well as the sum of two  p  &#8208;quaterphenyl chains. This tailor&#8208;made single&#8208;molecule parallel circuit is an ideal model for understanding electron transport process through parallel &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems, and may serve as a kernel component for molecular integrated circuits with controllable conductance.</dc:description>

      <title>Bridging Ultrasmall Au Clusters into the Pores of a Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photostability and Photocatalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Gold (Au) clusters loading on various supports were widely used in the fields of energy and biology. However, the poor photostability of Au clusters on support interface under longtime illumination usually results in loss of catalytic performance. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs ) with periodic and ultrasmall pore structures are ideal supports for dispersing and stabilizing Au clusters, while it is difficult to encapsulate Au clusters into the ultrasmall pore structures.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gold (Au) clusters loading on various supports were widely used in the fields of energy and biology. However, the poor photostability of Au clusters on support interface under longtime illumination usually results in loss of catalytic performance. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs ) with periodic and ultrasmall pore structures are ideal supports for dispersing and stabilizing Au clusters, while it is difficult to encapsulate Au clusters into the ultrasmall pore structures. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF modified with thiol chains (&#8208;SH) in its pores was prepared. Taking &#8208;SH as nucleation sites, Au NCs can in situ grow within the COF.

      <title>Light&#8208;harvesting nanoparticle probes for FRET&#8208;based detection of oligonucleotides with single&#8208;molecule sensitivity</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling emission of bright luminescent nanoparticles by a single molecular recognition event remains an ultimate challenge in the design of ultrasensitive probes for biomolecules.

Being 87&#8208;fold brighter than quantum dots QDots605 in single&#8208;particle microscopy (with 550&#8208;nm excitation), these DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles exhibit &gt;50% total FRET efficiency to a single hybridized FRET acceptor, a highly photostable carbopyronine dye (ATTO665). The obtained FRET nanoprobes enable single&#8208;molecule detection of short DNA and RNA, encoding a cancer marker, and imaging single hybridization events by an epi&#8208;fluorescence microscope with ultralow excitation irradiance close to ambient sunlight.</dc:description>

      <title>Polymer Networks: From Plastics and Gels to Porous Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Polymer networks are materials composed of linear strands connected by multifunctional junctions. These strands and junctions can be flexible or rigid (macro)molecules, and the connections between strands and junctions can be covalent or non&#8208;covalent. Thus, polymer networks comprise a vast array of useful materials ranging from elastomers and gels to porous crystalline frameworks.







Abstract
Polymer networks, which are materials composed of many smaller components&#8212;referred to as &#8220;junctions&#8221; and &#8220;strands&#8221;&#8212;connected together via covalent or non&#8208;covalent/supramolecular interactions, are arguably the most versatile, widely studied, broadly used, and important materials known. From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that must be addressed to enable a complete understanding of these materials and facilitate their development for emerging applications ranging from sustainability and energy harvesting/storage to tissue engineering and additive manufacturing. Here, we provide a unifying overview of the fundamentals of polymer network synthesis, structure, and properties, tying together recent trends in the field that are not always associated with classical polymer networks, such as the advent of crystalline &#8220;framework&#8221; materials. We also highlight recent advances in using molecular design and control of topology to showcase how a deep understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships can lead to advanced networks with exceptional properties.

      <title>Achieving Efficient Multichannel Conductance in Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Single&#8208;Molecule Parallel Circuits</title>

However, the reports on single&#8208;molecule parallel circuits are extremely rare.

      <title>Amphiphilic Polyphenylene Dendron Conjugates for Surface Remodeling of Adenovirus 5</title>
      <dc:description>The arrangement of amphiphilic surface groups plays an important role in many biological processes such as protein folding or biorecognition. We report the synthesis of amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrimer branches (dendrons) providing alternating hydrophilic and lipophilic surface groups and one reactive enthynyl group at the core. The amphiphilic surface groups serve as biorecognition units that bind to the surface of adenovirus 5 (Ad5), which is one of the most common vectors in gene therapy. The Ad5/dendron complexes showed high gene transduction efficiencies in coxsackie&#8208;adenovirus receptor (CAR)&#8208;negative cells. Moreover, the dendrons offer incorporating new functions at the dendron core by  in situ  post&#8208;modifications even when bound to the Ad5 surface. In this way, we provide a new platform for introducing bioactive groups to the Ad5 surface without the necessity to chemically modify the virus particles. Moreover, we analyzed binding of blood proteins to surfaces coated with amphiphilic dendrons, which is essential to predict their performance in the blood stream and of high relevance for  in vivo  applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We now report simple and efficient nitrile&#8208;directed  meta  &#8208;C&#8211;H olefination, acetoxylation and iodination of biaryls. Compared to our previous approach of installing a complex U&#8208;shaped template to achieve a molecular U&#8208;turn and assemble the large sized cyclophane transition state for the remote C&#8211;H activation, a synthetically useful phenyl nitrile functional group could also direct remote  meta  &#8208;C&#8211;H activation.

      <title>Formation and Fate of Formaldehyde in the Methanol&#8208;To&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction: An In Situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
      <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO) has been confirmed as an active intermediate in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction, which is critical for interpreting the mechanisms of coke formation. In this work, HCHO was unambiguously detected and quantified for the first time during the MTH process over HSAPO&#8208;34 and HZSM&#8208;5 by  in situ  synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS). Compared with conventional methods, excellent time&#8208;resolved profiles (5 s intervals) of SR&#8208;PIMS could be obtained to study the formation and fate of HCHO and other products in the induction period, steady&#8208;state reaction period and deactivation period. The relationship between the yields of HCHO and other products in MTH reaction was directly observed. Similar formation trends of HCHO and methane, and their close correlation in yields suggest that they are mainly derived from the disproportionation of methanol on acid sites. In the presence of Y  2  O  3  , the amount of HCHO changed greatly, which further affected the hydrogen transfer processes of olefins to aromatics and aromatics to coke formation. In addition, the yield of HCHO will affect the contribution of the aromatic&#8208;based cycle and the formation of ethylene, indicating that ethylene is mainly formed from the aromatic&#8208;based cycle. These results are of great significance for understanding the MTH reaction and catalyst deactivation.</dc:description>

      <title>Monolayer Two&#8208;dimensional Molecular Crystals for Ultrasensitive OFET&#8208;based Chemical Sensor</title>
      <dc:description>The sensitivity of conventional thin film OFETs&#8208;based sensors is limited by the diffusion of analytes through bulk films, and remains the central challenge in sensing technology. Here, for the first time we reported an ultrasensitive (sub&#8208;ppb level) sensor exploiting n&#8208;type monolayer molecular crystals (MMCs) with porous two&#8208;dimensional structures. Thanks to monolayer crystal structure of NDI3HU&#8208;DTYM2 (NDI) and controlled formation of porous structure, a world&#8208;record detection limit of NH  3  (0.1 ppb) was achieved. Moreover, the MMC&#8208;OFETs also enabled direct detection of solid analytes of biological amine derivatives, such as dopamine at an extremely low concentration of 500 ppb. The remarkably improved sensing performances of MMC&#8208;OFETs open up the possibility of engineering OFETs for ultrasensitive (bio)chemical sensing.</dc:description>

      <title>Bridging Ultrasmall Au Clusters into the Pores of a Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photostability and Photocatalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Gold (Au) clusters loading on various supports were widely used in the fields of energy and biology. However, the poor photostability of Au clusters on support interface under longtime illumination usually results in loss of catalytic performance. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs ) with periodic and ultrasmall pore structures are ideal supports for dispersing and stabilizing Au clusters, while it is difficult to encapsulate Au clusters into the ultrasmall pore structures. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF modified with thiol chains (&#8208;SH) in its pores was prepared. Taking &#8208;SH as nucleation sites, Au NCs can in situ grow within the COF. Ultrasmall pore structure of COF and the strong binding energy of S&#8208;Au provide double assurance for improving the dispersibility of Au NCs under longtime light illumination conditions. Interestingly, the artificial Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic system was constructed due to the form of Au&#8208;S&#8208;COF bonding bridge, which is deemed to be an ideal means to increase the charge separation efficiency. Such new strategy provides a facile guideline for rationally designing COF support catalysts with controllable activity and high stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;harvesting nanoparticle probes for FRET&#8208;based detection of oligonucleotides with single&#8208;molecule sensitivity</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling emission of bright luminescent nanoparticles by a single molecular recognition event remains an ultimate challenge in the design of ultrasensitive probes for biomolecules. It would require an efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the nanoparticle to a single acceptor at its surface, which is not realized to date. Here, we developed 20&#8208;nm light&#8208;harvesting nanoantenna particles, built of a tailor&#8208;made hydrophobic charged polymer poly(ethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylic acid), encapsulating ~1000 strongly coupled and highly emissive rhodamine dyes with their bulky counterion. Being 87&#8208;fold brighter than quantum dots QDots605 in single&#8208;particle microscopy (with 550&#8208;nm excitation), these DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles exhibit &gt;50% total FRET efficiency to a single hybridized FRET acceptor, a highly photostable carbopyronine dye (ATTO665). The obtained FRET nanoprobes enable single&#8208;molecule detection of short DNA and RNA, encoding a cancer marker, and imaging single hybridization events by an epi&#8208;fluorescence microscope with ultralow excitation irradiance close to ambient sunlight.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Crystalline and Semiconducting Imine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers Enabled by Interfacial Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;layer and multi&#8208;layer 2D polyimine films have been achieved through the interfacial synthesis methods, which have provided attractive prospects for their functions as electroactive layers in optoelectronic devices. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve the maximum degree of crystallinity in the 2D polyimines, which largely limits the long&#8208;range transport properties. Here we employ a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) method for the successful preparation of porphyrin and triazine containing polyimine&#8208;based 2D polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) films with square and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The synthetic PI&#8208;2DP films are featured with polycrystalline multilayers with tunable thickness from 6 to 200 nm and large crystalline domains (100&#8208;150 nm in size). Intrigued by high crystallinity and the presence of electroactive porphyrin moieties, the optoelectronic properties of PI&#8208;2DP are investigated by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy. Typically, the porphyrin&#8208;based PI&#8208;2DP  1  film exhibits a  p  &#8208;type semiconductor behavior with a band gap of 1.38 eV and hole mobility as high as 0.01 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , superior to the previously reported polyimine based materials. This work paves the way for the controlled synthesis of large&#8208;area and highly crystalline 2D polyimines which may benefit to fully exploiting their properties for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Unprecedented Sequence Control and Sequence&#8208;Driven Properties in A Series of AB&#8208;Alternating Copolymers Consisting Solely of Acrylamide Units</title>
      <dc:description>In this article, we report a method to synthesize a series of alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units. Crucial to realizing the unprecedented polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer that contains acrylate and acrylamide moieties connected via two activated ester bonds. This elaborate design, which is based on the reactivity ratio of the embedded vinyl groups, allows a &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization, wherein the intramolecular and intermolecular propagation are repeated alternately under dilute conditions. The addition of an amine to the resulting cyclopolymers afforded two different acryl amide units, i.e., an amine&#8208;substituted acryl amide and a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ethyl&#8208;substituted acryl amide in alternating sequence. Using this method, we were able to furnish ten types of alternating copolymers; some of these exhibit unique properties in solution and in the bulk, which are clearly different from those of the corresponding random copolymers, and we attributed the observed differences to the alternating sequence.</dc:description>

      <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Free Patterning of Cooperative&#8208;Thermoresponse Images by the Synergy of the AIEgen with the Liquid Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>Patterning multiple images within a single element without crosstalk can significantly increase the information capacity and security. Yet, it still remains challenging to enable the response capability in each image. Herein, we successfully demonstrate the patterning of crosstalk&#8208;free yet cooperative&#8208;thermoresponse images (e.g., holographic and fluorescent images) by deliberately designing a liquid crystal (LC)/AIEgen system with a unique synergy. The AIEgen's fluorescence intensity is found to be well controlled by the LC while the LC's phase transition is in turn promoted by the AIEgen. The fluorescent image contrast is significantly boosted by efficient energy transfer (&#934;  ET: 96%) from the LC to the AIEgen. We further unveil that the AIEgen's photocyclization for fluorescent patterning occurs in a zero&#8208;order kinetic manner and can be completed within several minutes when assisted by the LC. The photocyclization conversion is proven to be quantitatively dependent on the aggregation size:  &#945;  ~ exp(&#8208;d), and able to reach as high as 98%.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Evidences for Metallic Cobalt Boosting CO2 Electroreduction on Pyridinic Nitrogen</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials (N&#8208;Cs) are emerging as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), although the activities are still unsatisfactory and the genuine active site thereof is still arguable. We herein demonstrate that CO  2  RR to CO preferentially take place on pyridinic N rather than pyrrolic N using phthalocyanine (Pc) and porphyrin with well&#8208;defined N&#8208;C configurations as molecular model catalysts. Systematic experiments and theoretic calculations further discover that the CO  2  RR performance on pyridinic N can be significantly boosted by electronic modulation from in&#8208;situ generated metallic Co nanoparticles. By introducing Co nanoparticles, Co@Pc/C can achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 84% and CO current density of 28 mA cm  &#8208;2  at &#8208;0.9 V, which are 18 and 47 times higher than Pc/C without Co, respectively. These findings provide the new insights into the CO  2  RR on N&#8208;Cs, which may guide the exploration of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

      <title>Polymer Networks: From Plastics and Gels to Porous Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Polymer networks are materials composed of linear strands connected by multifunctional junctions. These strands and junctions can be flexible or rigid (macro)molecules, and the connections between strands and junctions can be covalent or non&#8208;covalent. Thus, polymer networks comprise a vast array of useful materials ranging from elastomers and gels to porous crystalline frameworks.







Abstract
Polymer networks, which are materials composed of many smaller components&#8212;referred to as &#8220;junctions&#8221; and &#8220;strands&#8221;&#8212;connected together via covalent or non&#8208;covalent/supramolecular interactions, are arguably the most versatile, widely studied, broadly used, and important materials known. From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that must be addressed to enable a complete understanding of these materials and facilitate their development for emerging applications ranging from sustainability and energy harvesting/storage to tissue engineering and additive manufacturing. Here, we provide a unifying overview of the fundamentals of polymer network synthesis, structure, and properties, tying together recent trends in the field that are not always associated with classical polymer networks, such as the advent of crystalline &#8220;framework&#8221; materials. We also highlight recent advances in using molecular design and control of topology to showcase how a deep understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships can lead to advanced networks with exceptional properties.

      <title>Amphiphilic Polyphenylene Dendron Conjugates for Surface Remodeling of Adenovirus 5</title>
      <dc:description>The arrangement of amphiphilic surface groups plays an important role in many biological processes such as protein folding or biorecognition. We report the synthesis of amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrimer branches (dendrons) providing alternating hydrophilic and lipophilic surface groups and one reactive enthynyl group at the core. The amphiphilic surface groups serve as biorecognition units that bind to the surface of adenovirus 5 (Ad5), which is one of the most common vectors in gene therapy. The Ad5/dendron complexes showed high gene transduction efficiencies in coxsackie&#8208;adenovirus receptor (CAR)&#8208;negative cells. Moreover, the dendrons offer incorporating new functions at the dendron core by  in situ  post&#8208;modifications even when bound to the Ad5 surface. In this way, we provide a new platform for introducing bioactive groups to the Ad5 surface without the necessity to chemically modify the virus particles. Moreover, we analyzed binding of blood proteins to surfaces coated with amphiphilic dendrons, which is essential to predict their performance in the blood stream and of high relevance for  in vivo  applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Development of Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization of Biphenyl: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
      <dc:description>We now report simple and efficient nitrile&#8208;directed  meta  &#8208;C&#8211;H olefination, acetoxylation and iodination of biaryls. Compared to our previous approach of installing a complex U&#8208;shaped template to achieve a molecular U&#8208;turn and assemble the large sized cyclophane transition state for the remote C&#8211;H activation, a synthetically useful phenyl nitrile functional group could also direct remote  meta  &#8208;C&#8211;H activation. This reaction provides a useful method for modifying biaryl compounds because the nitrile can be readily converted to amines, acids, amides or other heterocycles. Notably, the remote  meta  &#8208;selectivity of biphenylnitriles could not be expected from previous results with a macrocyclophane nitrile template. DFT computational studies now show that a ligand&#8208;containing Pd&#8211;Ag heterodimeric transition state (TS) favors the desired remote  meta  &#8208;selectivity. Control experiments demonstrate the directing effect of the nitrile and exclude the possibility of non&#8208;directed  meta  &#8208;C&#8211;H activation. Substituted 2&#8208;pyridone ligands were found to be key in assisting the cleavage of the  meta&#8208;  C&#8211;H bond in the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) process.</dc:description>

      <title>Formation and Fate of Formaldehyde in the Methanol&#8208;To&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction: An In Situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
      <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO) has been confirmed as an active intermediate in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction, which is critical for interpreting the mechanisms of coke formation. In this work, HCHO was unambiguously detected and quantified for the first time during the MTH process over HSAPO&#8208;34 and HZSM&#8208;5 by  in situ  synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS). Compared with conventional methods, excellent time&#8208;resolved profiles (5 s intervals) of SR&#8208;PIMS could be obtained to study the formation and fate of HCHO and other products in the induction period, steady&#8208;state reaction period and deactivation period. The relationship between the yields of HCHO and other products in MTH reaction was directly observed. Similar formation trends of HCHO and methane, and their close correlation in yields suggest that they are mainly derived from the disproportionation of methanol on acid sites. In the presence of Y  2  O  3  , the amount of HCHO changed greatly, which further affected the hydrogen transfer processes of olefins to aromatics and aromatics to coke formation. In addition, the yield of HCHO will affect the contribution of the aromatic&#8208;based cycle and the formation of ethylene, indicating that ethylene is mainly formed from the aromatic&#8208;based cycle. These results are of great significance for understanding the MTH reaction and catalyst deactivation.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Crystalline and Semiconducting Imine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers Enabled by Interfacial Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;layer and multi&#8208;layer 2D polyimine films have been achieved through the interfacial synthesis methods, which have provided attractive prospects for their functions as electroactive layers in optoelectronic devices. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve the maximum degree of crystallinity in the 2D polyimines, which largely limits the long&#8208;range transport properties. Here we employ a surfactant&#8208;monolayer&#8208;assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) method for the successful preparation of porphyrin and triazine containing polyimine&#8208;based 2D polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) films with square and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The synthetic PI&#8208;2DP films are featured with polycrystalline multilayers with tunable thickness from 6 to 200 nm and large crystalline domains (100&#8208;150 nm in size). Intrigued by high crystallinity and the presence of electroactive porphyrin moieties, the optoelectronic properties of PI&#8208;2DP are investigated by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy. Typically, the porphyrin&#8208;based PI&#8208;2DP  1  film exhibits a  p  &#8208;type semiconductor behavior with a band gap of 1.38 eV and hole mobility as high as 0.01 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , superior to the previously reported polyimine based materials. This work paves the way for the controlled synthesis of large&#8208;area and highly crystalline 2D polyimines which may benefit to fully exploiting their properties for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

Herein we wish to report a new, effective therapeutic strategy that small molecule inhibitors simultaneously targeting bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are rationally designed as promising therapeutic agents for pancreatic cancer. A highly potent dual inhibitor ( 13a  ) is identified to possess excellent and balanced activities against BRD4 BD1 (IC 50  = 11 nM) and HDAC1 (IC 50  = 21 nM).

      <title>Unprecedented Sequence Control and Sequence&#8208;Driven Properties in A Series of AB&#8208;Alternating Copolymers Consisting Solely of Acrylamide Units</title>
      <dc:description>In this article, we report a method to synthesize a series of alternating copolymers that consist exclusively of acrylamide units. Crucial to realizing the unprecedented polymer synthesis is the design of a divinyl monomer that contains acrylate and acrylamide moieties connected via two activated ester bonds. This elaborate design, which is based on the reactivity ratio of the embedded vinyl groups, allows a &#8220;selective&#8221; cyclopolymerization, wherein the intramolecular and intermolecular propagation are repeated alternately under dilute conditions. The addition of an amine to the resulting cyclopolymers afforded two different acryl amide units, i.e., an amine&#8208;substituted acryl amide and a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ethyl&#8208;substituted acryl amide in alternating sequence. Using this method, we were able to furnish ten types of alternating copolymers; some of these exhibit unique properties in solution and in the bulk, which are clearly different from those of the corresponding random copolymers, and we attributed the observed differences to the alternating sequence.</dc:description>

      <title>A Comparison of Two Isoreticular Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Cationic and Neutral Skeletons: Stability, Mechanism, and Functionality</title>
      <dc:description>Although many ionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been reported, people still know few about how the charge of skeleton affect the properties of MOF materials. We here for the first time report that the chemical stability of MOFs can be substantially improved through embedding electrostatic interactions in structure. As demonstrated, MOF with a cationic skeleton is impervious to extremely acidic, oxidative, reductive, and high ionic strength conditions such as 12 M HCl (301 days), aqua regia (86 days), H  2  O  2  (30 days), and seawater (30 days), which is surprisingly unprecedented in MOFs. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the cationic framework shows repulsive interaction and large steric hindrance toward the positively charged species in microenvironments, thus protecting the vulnerable dative bonds in structure to achieve high chemical stability. Diverse functionalities can be simultaneously bestowed by substituting the counterions of the charged framework with identically charged functional species, which broadens the horizon in the design of MOFs adaptable to a demanding environment with specific functionalities.</dc:description>

      <title>NHC&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Unactivated Olefin and Methylenecyclopropane.</title>
      <dc:description>Cross&#8208;dimerization of methylenecyclopropane 1 (or 1&#162;) and unactivated alkene 2 over a typical hydroalkenylation reactivity was observed for the first time by using a new [NHC&#8208;Ni(allyl)]BArF catalyst. Results showed that the C&#8208;C cleavage of 1 (or 1') did not involve a Ni(0) oxidative addition, which is crucial in former systems. This emerges a complementary method for attaining highly chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective synthesis of methylenecyclopentane 3 and broad scope. An efficient NHC&#8208;Ni(II) catalyzed rearrangement of 1 (or 1') was found liable for convergent synthesis of 3 in the presence of 2.</dc:description>

      <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Total Synthesis of Yaku&#8217;amide B Enabled by Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report a solid&#8208;phase strategy for total synthesis of the peptidic natural product yaku&#8217;amide B (1). Compound 1 exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cells. Its linear tridecapeptide sequence bears four &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dialkylated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid residues [(Z)&#8208;&#916;Ile&#8208;2/9, (E)&#8208;&#916;Ile&#8208;4, and &#916;Val&#8208;13], and is capped with an N&#8208;terminal acyl group (NTA) and a C&#8208;terminal amine (CTA). To realize the Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase synthesis of this highly complex structure, we devised and optimized new methods for enamide formation, enamide deprotection, and C&#8208;terminal modification. First, traceless Staudinger ligation enabled enamide formation between sterically encumbered alkenyl azides and newly designed phosphinophenol esters, thereby constructing the three dipeptides with (Z)&#8208;&#916;Ile or (E)&#8208;&#916;Ile in a solution and the C&#8208;terminal dipeptide with &#916;Val on a Wang&#8208;ChemMatrix resin. Second, application of Eu(OTf)3 led to chemoselective removal of the enamide Boc groups of (Z)&#8208;&#916;Ile and (E)&#8208;&#916;Ile without detaching the resin linker. The combination of these two methods allowed us to elongate the NTA&#8208;attached tridecapeptide sequence on the resin. Finally, resin&#8208;cleavage and C&#8208;terminus modification were simultaneously achieved with an ester&#8208;amide exchange reaction using CTA and AlMe3 to deliver 1 in 9.1% overall yield (24 steps from the resin). The established route permits efficient access to 1 and should be applicable for the solid&#8208;phase preparation of its analogues and various other natural peptides with non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic Networks with Enhanced Photodynamic Antimicrobial Activity from Conjugated Polythiophene/Polyisocyanide Hybrid Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Hybrid biomimetic hydrogels with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generation efficiency under 600&#8197;nm light show high antibacterial activity. Additionally, the hybrid gels closely mimic the mechanical properties of biological gels, such as collagen and fibrin, including the strain&#8208;stiffening properties at low stresses.







Abstract
Hybrid biomimetic hydrogels with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generation efficiency under 600&#8197;nm light show high antibacterial activity. The hybrid gels are composed of helical tri(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized polyisocyanides (PICs) and a conformation&#8208;sensitive conjugated polythiophene, poly(3&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;triethylammonium&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;propyloxy)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;thiophene chloride) (PMNT). The PIC polymer serves as a scaffold to trap and align the PMNT backbone into a highly ordered conformation, resulting in redshifted, new sharp bands in the absorption and fluorescence spectra. Similar to PIC, the hybrid closely mimics the mechanical properties of biological gels, such as collagen and fibrin, including the strain stiffening properties at low stresses. Moreover, the PMNT/PIC hybrids show much higher ROS production efficiency under red light than PMNT only, leading to an efficient photodynamic antimicrobial effect towards various pathogenic bacteria.

Abstract
A new chiral Br&#248;nsted acid, generated in situ from a chiral phosphoric acid boron (CPAB) complex and water, was successfully applied to asymmetric indole reduction. This &#8220;designer acid catalyst&#8221;, which is more acidic than TsOH as suggested by DFT calculations, allows the unprecedented direct asymmetric reduction of C2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;unprotected indoles and features good to excellent enantioselectivities with broad functional group tolerance. DFT calculations and mechanistic experiments indicates that this reaction undergoes C3&#8208;protonation and hydride&#8208;transfer processes. Besides, bulky C2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;unprotected indoles are also suitable for this system.

      <title>(NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5: An Unusual Ammonium&#8208;Containing Metal Iodate Fluoride Showing Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Thermochromic Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
Multitalented: The introduction of ammonium into a bismuth iodate fluoride to give (NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5 led to a crystal showing a subtle balance of a strong second harmonic generation effect, large birefringence, and a high laser damage threshold.

An ammonium&#8208;containing metal iodate fluoride compound, (NH4)Bi2(IO3)2F5, featuring a two&#8208;dimensional double&#8208;layered framework constructed by [BiO2F5]6&#8722; and [BiO4F4]9&#8722; polyhedra, as well as [IO3]&#8722; groups, was successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;ordered alignment of these SHG&#8208;active units leads to an extraordinary strong SHG response of 9.2 times that of KDP. Moreover, this compound possesses a large birefringence (&#916;n=0.0690 at 589.3&#8197;nm), a wide energy band gap (Eg=3.88&#8197;eV), and a high laser damage threshold (LDT; 40.2&#215;AgGaS2). In particular, thermochromic behavior was observed for the first time in this type of compound. Such multifunctional crystals will expand the application of nonlinear optical materials.

      <title>Halide&#8208;Based Materials and Chemistry for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Halide&#8208;based materials are an important part of high&#8208;performance electrode materials as well as stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and new battery types, including magnesium, aluminum, halide&#8208;ion, metal&#8208;halogen, and liquid&#8208;metal batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art halide&#8208;based materials in rechargeable batteries are reviewed, with a focus on challenges and perspectives.







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are considered one of the most effective energy storage technologies to bridge the production and consumption of renewable energy. The further development of rechargeable batteries with characteristics such as high energy density, low cost, safety, and a long cycle life is required to meet the ever&#8208;increasing energy&#8208;storage demands. This Review highlights the progress achieved with halide&#8208;based materials in rechargeable batteries, including the use of halide electrodes, bulk and/or surface halogen&#8208;doping of electrodes, electrolyte design, and additives that enable fast ion shuttling and stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces, as well as realization of new battery chemistry. Battery chemistry based on monovalent cation, multivalent cation, anion, and dual&#8208;ion transfer is covered. This Review aims to promote the understanding of halide&#8208;based materials to stimulate further research and development in the area of high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. It also offers a perspective on the exploration of new materials and systems for electrochemical energy storage.

2019 marked the 75th anniversary of Erwin Schr&#246;dinger's book &#8220;What is Life?&#8212;The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell&#8221; in which he gives his view on living processes in terms of the hereditary mechanism, mutations, order, disorder, and entropy. Although criticized by several of his colleagues, the book has served as inspiration for generations of scientists.







Abstract
In his book What is Life?&#8212;The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell, Erwin Schr&#246;dinger gives a &#8220;na&#239;ve physicist's&#8221; answer to the question &#8220;how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?&#8221; Although his book was met with criticism from some of his colleagues, it has had a large impact and has served as profound inspiration for pioneers of molecular biology as well as for later generations of both scientists and laymen.

      <title>Athermal and Soft Multi&#8208;Nanopatterning of Azopolymers: Phototunable Mechanical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Changing tunes: Phototunable mechanics of the azopolymer include a photoswitchable glass&#8208;transition temperature and photoinduced change from glassy plastic to viscoplastic polymer. The tunable mechanical properties ensure fabrication of multiple nanopatterns on flexible substrates by combining athermal nanoimprint lithography and photolithography.







Abstract
Imprinting nanopatterns on flexible substrates has diverse applications in advanced fabrication. However, the traditional thermal nanoimprint lithography (T&#8208;NIL) often causes shrinkage upon cooling. Here, a simple yet versatile method is introduced to fabricate multiple nanopatterns on a flexible substrate coated with an azopolymer by combining athermal nanoimprint lithography (AT&#8208;NIL) and photolithography. The azopolymer has various mechanical properties upon photoirradiation: 1)&#8197;phototunable glass&#8208;transition temperatures (Tg) and concomitantly photoinduced switch from glassy plastic to viscoplastic polymer; 2)&#8197;prominent modulation of viscoplasticity under light illumination at different wavelengths. Regionally selective multiple nanopatterns are conveniently fabricated, presenting angle&#8208;dependent structural color images on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates. The flexible, athermal and multiple nanopatterning method has the potential for on&#8208;demand fabrication of complex nanopatterns.

      <title>Dynamic Complex&#8208;to&#8208;Complex Transformations of Heterobimetallic Systems Influence the Cage Structure or Spin State of Iron(II) Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Lively exchanges: Two new heterobimetallic cages with iron(II) cations in a sterically strained coordination sphere undergo complex&#8208;to&#8208;complex transformation. Subcomponent&#8208;exchange reactions with sterically less crowded building blocks changed the spin state from high&#8208; to low&#8208;spin iron(II), whereas ligand exchange with chelating ligands effected the structural transformation from cubic to bipyramidal cages.







Abstract
Two new heterobimetallic cages, a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal and a cubic one, were assembled from the same mononuclear metalloligand by adopting the molecular library approach, using iron(II) and palladium(II) building blocks. The ligand system was designed to readily assemble through subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. It allowed the introduction of steric strain at the iron(II) centres, which stabilizes its paramagnetic high&#8208;spin state. This steric strain was utilized to drive dynamic complex&#8208;to&#8208;complex transformations with both the metalloligand and heterobimetallic cages. Addition of sterically less crowded subcomponents as a chemical stimulus transformed all complexes to their previously reported low&#8208;spin analogues. The metalloligand and bipyramid incorporated the new building block more readily than the cubic cage, probably because the geometric structure of the sterically crowded metalloligand favours the cube formation. Furthermore it was possible to provoke structural transformations upon addition of more favourable chelating ligands, converting the cubic structures into bipyramidal ones.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Dynamic Complex&#8208;to&#8208;Complex Transformations of Heterobimetallic Systems Influence the Cage Structure or Spin State of Iron(II) Ions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lively exchanges&lt;/b&gt;: Two new heterobimetallic cages with iron(II) cations in a sterically strained coordination sphere undergo complex&#8208;to&#8208;complex transformation. Subcomponent&#8208;exchange reactions with sterically less crowded building blocks changed the spin state from high&#8208; to low&#8208;spin iron(II), whereas ligand exchange with chelating ligands effected the structural transformation from cubic to bipyramidal cages.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new heterobimetallic cages, a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal and a cubic one, were assembled from the same mononuclear metalloligand by adopting the molecular library approach, using iron(II) and palladium(II) building blocks. The ligand system was designed to readily assemble through subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. It allowed the introduction of steric strain at the iron(II) centres, which stabilizes its paramagnetic high&#8208;spin state. This steric strain was utilized to drive dynamic complex&#8208;to&#8208;complex transformations with both the metalloligand and heterobimetallic cages. Addition of sterically less crowded subcomponents as a chemical stimulus transformed all complexes to their previously reported low&#8208;spin analogues. The metalloligand and bipyramid incorporated the new building block more readily than the cubic cage, probably because the geometric structure of the sterically crowded metalloligand favours the cube formation. Furthermore it was possible to provoke structural transformations upon addition of more favourable chelating ligands, converting the cubic structures into bipyramidal ones.&lt;/p&gt;

Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal synthesis of helical polymers of trehalose by the topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction of a monomer is presented. This solvent&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free polymerization method that eliminates tedious purification steps exemplifies the elegance of topochemical polymerization over traditional solution&#8208;phase polymerization.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline helical polymers of trehalose via topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) of a trehalose&#8208;based monomer is presented. An unsymmetrical trehalose derivative having azide and alkyne crystallizes in two different forms having almost similar packing. Upon heating, both the crystals undergo TAAC reaction to form crystalline polymers. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) studies revealed that the monomers in both the crystals polymerize in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion; circular dichroism (CD) studies of the product crystals revealed that the formed polymer is helically ordered. This solvent&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free polymerization method that eliminates the tedious purification of the polymeric product exemplifies the advantage of topochemical polymerization reaction over traditional solution&#8208;phase polymerization.

      <title>Amorphous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Dominated Nanocomposites with Both Compositional and Structural Heterogeneity for Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
An amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework (aMOF&#8208;NC) featuring both structural and compositional complexity was synthesized by a ligand&#8208;competition amorphization strategy. The resultant aMOF&#8208;NC possesses a core&#8211;shell nanorod@nanosheet architecture. Each building block has a different composition, which demonstrates excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity.







Abstract
Amorphous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (aMOFs) are an emerging family of attractive materials with great application potential, however aMOFs are usually prepared under harsh conditions and aMOFs with complex compositions and structures are rarely reported. In this work, an aMOF&#8208;dominated nanocomposite (aMOF&#8208;NC) with both structural and compositional complexity has been synthesized using a facile approach. A ligand&#8208;competition amorphization mechanism is proposed based on experimental and density functional theory calculation results. The aMOF&#8208;NC possesses a core&#8211;shell nanorod@nanosheet architecture, including a Fe&#8208;rich Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;aMOF core and a Co&#8208;rich Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;aMOF shell in the core&#8211;shell structured nanorod, and amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets as the outer layer. Benefiting from the structural and compositional heterogeneity, the aMOF&#8208;NC demonstrates an excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential of 249&#8197;mV at 10.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 39.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1.

Abstract
The catalytic generation of hypervalent iodine(III) reagents by anodic electrooxidation was orchestrated towards an unprecedented electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxygenation of weakly coordinating aromatic amides and ketones. Thus, catalytic quantities of iodoarenes in concert with catalytic amounts of ruthenium(II) complexes set the stage for versatile C&#8722;H activations with ample scope and high functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic studies by experiment and computation substantiate the role of the iodoarene as the electrochemically relevant species towards C&#8722;H oxygenations with electricity as a sustainable oxidant and molecular hydrogen as the sole by&#8208;product. para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H oxygenations likewise proved viable in the absence of directing groups.

      <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of MOF&#8208;Templated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Electrocatalysts for Boosting CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A host&#8211;guest cooperative protection strategy has been developed for constructing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), extending the range of available precursors from nitrogenous to non&#8208;nitrogenous MOFs. The obtained Ni&#8208;SACs (NiSA&#8208;Nx&#8208;C; x=2, 3, 4) at different pyrolysis temperatures feature varying nitrogen coordination numbers. The best of these catalysts, NiSA&#8208;N2&#8208;C, shows superior activity and selectivity in CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
The general synthesis and control of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a great challenge. Herein, a general host&#8211;guest cooperative protection strategy has been developed to construct SACs by introducing polypyrrole (PPy) into a bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework. As an example, the introduction of Mg2+ in MgNi&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 extends the distance between adjacent Ni atoms; the PPy guests serve as N source to stabilize the isolated Ni atoms during pyrolysis. As a result, a series of single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts (named NiSA&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) with different N coordination numbers have been fabricated by controlling the pyrolysis temperature. Significantly, the NiSA&#8208;N2&#8208;C catalyst, with the lowest N coordination number, achieves high CO Faradaic efficiency (98&#8201;%) and turnover frequency (1622&#8197;h&#8722;1), far superior to those of NiSA&#8208;N3&#8208;C and NiSA&#8208;N4&#8208;C, in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the low N coordination number of single&#8208;atom Ni sites in NiSA&#8208;N2&#8208;C is favorable to the formation of COOH* intermediate and thus accounts for its superior activity.

As a result, a series of single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts (named Ni&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;C) with different N coordination numbers have been fabricated by controlling the pyrolysis temperature. Significantly, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;C catalyst, with the lowest N coordination number, achieves high CO Faradaic efficiency (98&#8201;%) and turnover frequency (1622&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), far superior to those of Ni&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;C and Ni&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;C, in electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the low N coordination number of single&#8208;atom Ni sites in Ni&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;C is favorable to the formation of COOH* intermediate and thus accounts for its superior activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of Acid Fluorides</title>
      <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;NHC catalysis is introduced as a strategy for engaging hitherto unsuitable carbonyl substrates at the carboxylic acid oxidation level in photochemical transformations of aldehydes and ketones. This approach enables an NHC&#8208;catalyzed photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction of acid fluorides to isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones. The NHC likely acts as a &#8220;transient aryl group&#8221; that temporarily changes the photochemical properties of the carbonyl substrate.







Abstract
The combination of light activation and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has enabled the use of acid fluorides as substrates in a UVA&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photochemical transformation previously observed only with aromatic aldehydes and ketones. Stoichiometric studies and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support a mechanism involving the photoactivation of an ortho&#8208;toluoyl azolium intermediate, which exhibits &#8220;ketone&#8208;like&#8221; photochemical reactivity under UVA irradiation. Using this photo&#8208;NHC catalysis approach, a novel photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) process was developed that leads to diverse isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.

Abstract
The redox&#8208;neutral dicarbofunctionalization of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins to form a variety of (hetero)cyclic compounds under photoinduced palladium catalysis is described. This cascade reaction process was used to couple styrenes or acryl amides with a broad range of highly decorated olefins tethered to aryl or alkyl bromides (&gt;50 examples). This procedure enables one or two contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers to be formed in a single step. The products could be readily diversified and applied in the synthesis of a bioactive oxindole analogue.

      <dc:description>
My preciouSSSS: Conventional mRNA nano&#8208;vectors limit their functions simply as transfection agents. Now, nanoparticles with a reducible tetrasulfide motif are presented that not only act as transfection agents, but also upregulate mRNA translation, thus achieving a higher in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo mRNA transfection efficacy in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells.







Abstract
Effective messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells delivered by vectors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Now it is hypothesized that the high intracellular glutathione level is associated with suppressed mRNA translation. This theory leads to a new design principle of next&#8208;generation mRNA vectors: nanoparticles with glutathione depletion chemistry upregulate mRNA translation and enhance transfection, which is beneficial for mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

A pharmacokinetic model: Dissolution kinetics from iron&#8208;doped copper oxide nanoparticles were modelled to establish structure&#8211;release relationships. With those finely tuned kinetics, a cancer treatment orthogonal to conventional chemotherapy was achieved both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

Abstract
The progress in nanomedicine (NM) using nanoparticles (NPs) is mainly based on drug carriers for the delivery of classical chemotherapeutics. As low NM delivery rates limit therapeutic efficacy, an entirely different approach was investigated. A homologous series of engineered CuO NPs was designed for dual purposes (carrier and drug) with a direct chemical composition&#8211;biological functionality relationship. Model&#8208;based dissolution kinetics of CuO NPs in the cellular interior at post&#8208;exposure conditions were controlled through Fe&#8208;doping for intra/extra cellular Cu2+ and biological outcome. Through controlled ion release and reactions taking place in the cellular interior, tumors could be treated selectively, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

      <title>BowtieArene: A Dual Macrocycle Exhibiting Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Colorful bowtie: The novel fluorescent dual macrocycle BowtieArene features a central tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived fluorophore, double pillar&#8208;like cavities, and solvent&#8208;, vapor&#8208;, and mechano&#8208;induced fluorochromism. The switchable fluorescence is closely related to changes in the molecular packing mode.







Abstract
Although highly useful in supramolecular chemistry, pillararenes lack a fluorophore in their skeleton. Here we present BowtieArene, a novel fluorescent dual macrocycle, featuring a central tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived fluorophore and two pillar&#8208;like, pentagon&#8208;shaped cavities which are comparable to pillar[5]arene. This concisely prepared, figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecule exhibits vapor absorption and host&#8211;guest capabilities, as well as intriguing switchable fluorescence. The fluorochromism of BowtieArene can be triggered by multiple external stimuli including solvent, vapor, and mechanical force, with excellent reversibility and stability. Experimental and theoretical evidence indicate that the fluorochromism should be closely related to molecular packing.

      <title>Highly Efficient Porous Carbon Electrocatalyst with Controllable N&#8208;Species Content for Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A means to an N: N&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) with a hierarchical porous structure and a high concentration of pyridinic&#8208;N and graphitic&#8208;N was prepared by calcinating a mixture of oxygen&#8208;rich Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and melamine. The optimized NPC shows a high electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction and high selectivity by suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
We report a straightforward strategy to design efficient N doped porous carbon (NPC) electrocatalyst that has a high concentration of easily accessible active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The NPC with large amounts of active N (pyridinic and graphitic N) and highly porous structure is prepared by using an oxygen&#8208;rich metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74) precursor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A means to an N&lt;/b&gt;: N&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) with a hierarchical porous structure and a high concentration of pyridinic&#8208;N and graphitic&#8208;N was prepared by calcinating a mixture of oxygen&#8208;rich Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and melamine. The optimized NPC shows a high electrocatalytic activity toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and high selectivity by suppressing hydrogen evolution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a straightforward strategy to design efficient N doped porous carbon (NPC) electrocatalyst that has a high concentration of easily accessible active sites for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). The NPC with large amounts of active N (pyridinic and graphitic N) and highly porous structure is prepared by using an oxygen&#8208;rich metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74) precursor. The amount of active N species can be tuned by optimizing the calcination temperature and time. Owing to the large pore sizes, the active sites are well exposed to electrolyte for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. The NPC exhibits superior CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity with a small onset potential of &#8722;0.35&#8197;V and a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.4&#8201;% towards CO at &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. RHE, one of the highest values among NPC&#8208;based CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts. This work advances an effective and facile way towards highly active and cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble&#8208;metal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nd3+&#8208;Sensitized Upconversion Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Amplified Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Two birds with one stone: Janus upconversion metal&#8211;organic framework nanostructures have been developed that allow both mitochondria&#8208;specific delivery and 808&#8197;nm NIR light&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen generation, leading to amplified photodynamic therapy with minimized overheating effect from the laser.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a mitochondria&#8208;specific, 808&#8197;nm NIR light&#8208;activated photodynamic therapy (PDT) system based on the combination of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and upconversion photochemistry with an organelle&#8208;targeting strategy. The system was synthesized through the growth of a porphyrinic MOF on Nd3+&#8208;sensitized upconversion nanoparticles to achieve Janus nanostructures with further asymmetric functionalization of the surface of the MOF domain. The PDT nanoplatform allows for photosensitizing with 808&#8197;nm NIR light, which could effectively avoid the laser&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced overheating effect. Furthermore, mitochondria&#8208;targeting could amplify PDT efficacy through the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and the initiation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This work sheds light on the hybrid engineering of MOFs to combat their current limitations for PDT.

      <title>Morphology&#8208;Reserved Synthesis of Discrete Nanosheets of CuO@SAPO&#8208;34 and Pore Mouth Catalysis for One&#8208;Pot Oxidation of Cyclohexane</title>
      <dc:description>
Like at the dentist: 2D and super&#8208;thin CuO@SAPO&#8208;4 nanosheets with &#8776;7&#8197;nm thickness and single crystalline structure have been synthesized. The nanosheets show excellent catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using O2 as oxidant through a pore mouth catalysis mechanism.







Abstract
Discrete nanosheets of silicon&#8208;doped AlPO4 molecular sieves (SAPO&#8208;34) with a thickness of &#8776;7&#8197;nm have been prepared through morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis with a lamellar aluminum phosphate as precursor. Cages of the nanosheets are in situ incorporated with copper oxide clusters. The CuO@SAPO&#8208;34 nanosheets exhibit a large external surface area with a high number of (010) channel pores on the surface. Due to the thin morphology, copper oxide clusters occupy the outmost cages with a probability &gt;50&#8201;%. The distinctive configuration facilitates a new concept of pore mouth catalysis, i.e., reactant molecules larger than the pores cannot enter the interior of the molecular sieves but can interact with the CuO clusters at &#8220;the mouth&#8221; of the pore. In heterogeneous catalysis, CuO@SAPO&#8208;34 nanosheets have shown top performance in one&#8208;pot oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid by O2, a key compound for the manufacture of nylon&#8208;66, which is so far produced using non&#8208;green nitric acid oxidation.

      <title>Separation of Xe from Kr with Record Selectivity and Productivity in Anion&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Materials by Inverse Size&#8208;Sieving</title>
      <dc:description>
The flexible material ZU&#8208;62 is utilized for Xe/Kr separation. Molecular exclusion of the smaller&#8208;sized Kr from the larger&#8208;sized Xe results in record Xe/Kr selectivity and ultrahigh Xe capacity. The pore aperture of ZU&#8208;62 spontaneously expands and adapts to the shape and size of Xe atom upon adsorption, whereas no change is induced by Kr.







Abstract
The separation of xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) mixture is of great importance to industry, but the available porous materials allow the adsorption of both, Xe and Kr only with limited selectivity. Herein we report an anion&#8208;pillared ultramicroporous material NbOFFIVE&#8208;2&#8208;Cu&#8208;i (ZU&#8208;62) with finely tuned pore aperture size and structure flexibility, which for the first time enables an inverse size&#8208;sieving effect in separation along with record Xe/Kr selectivity and ultrahigh Xe capacity. Evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the rotation of anions and pyridine rings upon contact of larger&#8208;size Xe atoms adapts cavities to the shape/size of Xe and allows strong host&#8208;Xe interaction, while the smaller&#8208;size Kr is excluded. Breakthrough experiments confirmed that ZU&#8208;62 has a real practical potential for producing high&#8208;purity Kr and Xe from air&#8208;separation byproducts, showing record Kr productivity (206&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Xe productivity (42&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1, in desorption) as well as good recyclability.

      <title>Sequential Chemistry Toward Core&#8211;Shell Structured Metal Sulfides as Stable and Highly Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Full CoSx jacket: Uniform metal sulfide core&#8211;shell structures with tunable chemical compositions, a clean surface and substantial lattice mismatches between them was synthesized via a universal sequential synthesis approach.







Abstract
A universal sequential synthesis strategy in aqueous solution is presented for highly uniform core&#8211;shell structured photocatalysts, which consist of a metal sulfide light absorber core and a metal sulfide co&#8208;catalyst shell. We show that the sequential chemistry can drive the formation of unique core&#8211;shell structures controlled by the constant of solubility product of metal sulfides. A variety of metal sulfide core&#8211;shell structures have been demonstrated, including CdS@CoSx, CdS@MnSx, CdS@NiSx, CdS@ZnSx, CuS@CdS, and more complexed CdS@ZnSx@CoSx. The obtained strawberry&#8208;like CdS@CoSx core&#8211;shell structures exhibit a high photocatalytic H2 production activity of 3.92&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 67.3&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which is much better than that of pure CdS nanoballs (0.28&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1), CdS/CoSx composites (0.57&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1), and 5&#8201;%wt Pt&#8208;loaded CdS photocatalysts (1.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1).

&lt;b&gt;jacket&lt;/b&gt;: Uniform metal sulfide core&#8211;shell structures with tunable chemical compositions, a clean surface and substantial lattice mismatches between them was synthesized via a universal sequential synthesis approach.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal sequential synthesis strategy in aqueous solution is presented for highly uniform core&#8211;shell structured photocatalysts, which consist of a metal sulfide light absorber core and a metal sulfide co&#8208;catalyst shell. We show that the sequential chemistry can drive the formation of unique core&#8211;shell structures controlled by the constant of solubility product of metal sulfides. A variety of metal sulfide core&#8211;shell structures have been demonstrated, including CdS@CoS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, CdS@MnS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, CdS@NiS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, CdS@ZnS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, CuS@CdS, and more complexed CdS@ZnS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@CoS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. The obtained strawberry&#8208;like CdS@CoS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; core&#8211;shell structures exhibit a high photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production activity of 3.92&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 67.3&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which is much better than that of pure CdS nanoballs (0.28&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), CdS/CoS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; composites (0.57&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and 5&#8201;%wt Pt&#8208;loaded CdS photocatalysts (1.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crucial Roles of Two Hydrated Mg2+ Ions in Reaction Catalysis of the Pistol Ribozyme</title>
      <dc:description>
Role play: Transition&#8208;state mimic and product crystal structures suggest that two hydrated metal ions are involved in pistol ribozyme cleavage chemistry. One of them remains innersphere&#8208;coordinated to N7 of a guanosine and plays a key role in catalysis.







Abstract
Pistol ribozymes constitute a new class of small self&#8208;cleaving RNAs. Crystal structures have been solved, providing three&#8208;dimensional snapshots along the reaction coordinate of pistol phosphodiester cleavage, corresponding to the pre&#8208;catalytic state, a vanadate mimic of the transition state, and the product. The results led to the proposed underlying chemical mechanism. Importantly, a hydrated Mg2+ ion remains innersphere&#8208;coordinated to N7 of G33 in all three states, and is consistent with its likely role as acid in general acid base catalysis (&#948; and &#946; catalysis). Strikingly, the new structures shed light on a second hydrated Mg2+ ion that approaches the scissile phosphate from its binding site in the pre&#8208;cleavage state to reach out for water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding in the cyclophosphate product. The major role of the second Mg2+ ion appears to be the stabilization of product conformation. This study delivers a mechanistic understanding of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed backbone cleavage.

      <title>Stable Heterometallic Cluster&#8208;Based Organic Framework Catalysts for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of stable heterometallic Fe2M cluster&#8208;based MOFs achieve the overall conversion of CO2 and H2O into HCOOH and O2 without the assistance of additional sacrificial agent and photosensitizer. A strategy is proposed to design crystalline photocatalysts to realize the overall artificial photosynthetic reaction.







Abstract
A series of stable heterometallic Fe2M cluster&#8208;based MOFs (NNU&#8208;31&#8208;M, M=Co, Ni, Zn) photocatalysts are presented. They can achieve the overall conversion of CO2 and H2O into HCOOH and O2 without the assistance of additional sacrificial agent and photosensitizer. The heterometallic cluster units and photosensitive ligands excited by visible light generate separated electrons and holes. Then, low&#8208;valent metal M accepts electrons to reduce CO2, and high&#8208;valent Fe uses holes to oxidize H2O. This is the first MOF photocatalyst system to finish artificial photosynthetic full reaction. It is noted that NNU&#8208;31&#8208;Zn exhibits the highest HCOOH yield of 26.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity of ca. 100&#8201;%). Furthermore, the DFT calculations based on crystal structures demonstrate the photocatalytic reaction mechanism. This work proposes a new strategy for how to design crystalline photocatalyst to realize artificial photosynthetic overall reaction.

      <title>Metabolic Labeling of Peptidoglycan with NIR&#8208;II Dye Enables In Vivo Imaging of Gut Microbiota</title>
      <dc:description>
A real&#8208;time in vivo imaging method to fulfill the unmet need for gut microbiota visualization was developed by integrating the strategy of d&#8208;amino acid&#8208;based metabolic labeling and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. The versatility of this technique was demonstrated in imaging different bacterial species, and in the study of gastrointestinal motility&#8208;induced gut microbiota biogeography changes.







Abstract
Deepening our understanding of mammalian gut microbiota has been greatly hampered by the lack of a facile, real&#8208;time, and in vivo bacterial imaging method. To address this unmet need in microbial visualization, we herein report the development of a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;based method for in vivo imaging of gut bacteria. Using d&#8208;propargylglycine in gavage and then click reaction with an azide&#8208;containing NIR&#8208;II dye, gut microbiota of a donor mouse was strongly labeled with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence on their peptidoglycan. The bacteria could be readily visualized in recipient mouse gut with high spatial resolution and deep tissue penetration under NIR irradiation. The NIR&#8208;II&#8208;based metabolic labeling strategy reported herein, provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first protocol for facile in vivo visualization of gut microbiota within deep tissues, and offers an instrumental tool for deciphering the complex biology of these gut &#8220;dark matters&#8221;.

A tip of the hap: A time&#8208;resolved chemical proteomics strategy enables host and pathogen temporal interaction profiling (HAPTIP) for tracking the entry of bacteria into host cell.







Abstract
Studying the dynamic interaction between host cells and pathogen is vital but remains technically challenging. We describe herein a time&#8208;resolved chemical proteomics strategy enabling host and pathogen temporal interaction profiling (HAPTIP) for tracking the entry of a pathogen into the host cell. A novel multifunctional chemical proteomics probe was introduced to label living bacteria followed by in&#8197;vivo crosslinking of bacteria proteins to their interacting host&#8208;cell proteins at different time points initiated by UV for label&#8208;free quantitative proteomics analysis. We observed over 400 specific interacting proteins crosslinked with the probe during the formation of Salmonella&#8208;containing vacuole (SCV). This novel chemical proteomics approach provides a temporal interaction profile of host and pathogen in high throughput and would facilitate better understanding of the infection process at the molecular level.

      <title>Naphthochromenones: Organic Bimodal Photocatalysts Engaging in Both Oxidative and Reductive Quenching Processes</title>
      <dc:description>
Fantastic twelve naphthochromenone photocatalysts (PCs) that absorb across the UV/Vis range and feature an extremely wide redox window (up to 3.22&#8197;eV) were synthesized on gram scale. Their excited&#8208;state redox potentials, PC*/PC.&#8722; (up to 1.65&#8197;V) and PC.+/PC* (up to &#8722;1.77&#8197;V vs. SCE), are such that these novel PCs can engage in both oxidative and reductive quenching.







Abstract
Twelve naphthochromenone photocatalysts (PCs) were synthesized on gram scale. They absorb across the UV/Vis range and feature an extremely wide redox window (up to 3.22&#8197;eV) that is accessible using simple visible light irradiation sources (CFL or LED). Their excited&#8208;state redox potentials, PC*/PC.&#8722; (up to 1.65&#8197;V) and PC.+/PC* (up to &#8722;1.77&#8197;V vs. SCE), are such that these novel PCs can engage in both oxidative and reductive quenching mechanisms with strong thermodynamic requirements. The potential of these bimodal PCs was benchmarked in synthetically relevant photocatalytic processes with extreme thermodynamic requirements. Their ability to efficiently catalyze mechanistically opposite oxidative/reductive photoreactions is a unique feature of these organic photocatalysts, thus representing a decisive advance towards generality, sustainability, and cost efficiency in photocatalysis.

Their excited&#8208;state redox potentials, PC*/PC&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (up to 1.65&#8197;V) and PC&lt;sup&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt;/PC* (up to &#8722;1.77&#8197;V vs. SCE), are such that these novel PCs can engage in both oxidative and reductive quenching mechanisms with strong thermodynamic requirements. The potential of these bimodal PCs was benchmarked in synthetically relevant photocatalytic processes with extreme thermodynamic requirements. Their ability to efficiently catalyze mechanistically opposite oxidative/reductive photoreactions is a unique feature of these organic photocatalysts, thus representing a decisive advance towards generality, sustainability, and cost efficiency in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carbon Dots with Dual&#8208;Emissive, Robust, and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Characteristics</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with dual&#8208;emissive, robust, and aggregation&#8208;induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) characteristics are reported. Potential applications of the as&#8208;prepared CDs in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeit and information encryption are also demonstrated.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) with dual&#8208;emissive, robust, and aggregation&#8208;induced RTP characteristics are reported for the first time. The TA&#8208;CDs are prepared via hydrothermal treatment of trimellitic acid and exhibit unique white prompt and yellow RTP emissions in solid state under UV excitation (365&#8197;nm) on and off, respectively. The yellow RTP emission of TA&#8208;CDs powder should be resulted from the formation of a new excited triplet state due to their aggregation, and the white prompt emission is due to their blue fluorescence and yellow RTP dual&#8208;emissive nature. The RTP emission of TA&#8208;CDs powder was highly stable under grinding, which is very rare amongst traditional pure organic RTP materials. To employ the unique characteristics of TA&#8208;CDs, advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption methodologies (water&#8208;stimuli&#8208;response producing RTP) were preliminarily investigated.

      <title>Enantioenriched Methylene&#8208;Bridged Benzazocanes Synthesis by Organocatalytic and Superacid Activations</title>
      <dc:description>
Organocatalysis meets superacid: An original synthetic strategy based on the sequential association of organocatalytic and superacid activations has been developed that allows the efficient preparation of optically&#8208;enriched methylene&#8208;bridged benzazocanes closely related to bioactive morphinan and benzomorphan scaffolds from simple achiral linear precursors.







Abstract
Achieving in a straightforward way the synthesis of enantioenriched elaborated three&#8208;dimensional molecules related to bioactive natural products remains a long&#8208;standing quest in organic synthesis. Enantioselective organocatalysis potentially offers a unique opportunity to solve this problem, especially when combined with complementary modes of activation. Here, we report the sequential association of organocatalytic and superacid activations of simple linear achiral readily available precursors to promote the formation of unique highly elaborated chiral methylene&#8208;bridged benzazocanes exhibiting three to five fully&#8208;controlled stereocenters. This peculiar backbone, difficult to assemble by standard synthetic approaches, is closely related to bioactive natural and synthetic morphinans and benzomorphans. The formation of a highly reactive chiral 7&#8208;membered ring N&#8208;acyl iminium superelectrophilic ion, evidenced by low&#8208;temperature in situ NMR experiments, triggers a challenging stereoselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization.

Abstract
Incorporation of a five&#8208;membered ring into a helicene framework disrupts aromatic conjugation and provides a site for selective deprotonation. The deprotonation creates an anionic cyclopentadienyl unit, switches on conjugation, leads to a &gt;200&#8197;nm red&#8208;shift in the absorbance spectrum and injects a charge into a helical conjugated &#960;&#8208;system without injecting a spin. Structural consequences of deprotonation were revealed via analysis of a monoanionic helicene co&#8208;crystallized with {K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)} and {Cs+2(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)3}. UV/Vis&#8208;monitoring of these systems shows a time&#8208;dependent formation of mono&#8208; and dianionic species, and the latter was isolated and crystallographically characterized. The ability of the twisted helicene frame to delocalize the negative charge was probed as a perturbation of aromaticity using NICS scans. Relief of strain, avoidance of antiaromaticity, and increase in charge delocalization assist in the additional dehydrogenative ring closures that yield a new planarized decacyclic dianion.

      <title>Direct Catalytic Decarboxylative Amination of Aryl Acetic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
The direct, chemoselective amination of aryl acetic acids is reported. The process enables late&#8208;stage alkylation of drug targets without interference from other protic groups or electrophiles. Mechanistic studies support the generation of a benzylic nucleophile which is aminated in a Chan&#8211;Lam&#8208;type redox pathway.







Abstract
The decarboxylative coupling of a carboxylic acid with an amine nucleophile provides an alternative to the substitution of traditional organohalide coupling partners. Benzoic and alkynyl acids may be directly aminated by oxidative catalysis. In contrast, methods for intermolecular alkyl carboxylic acid to amine conversion, including amidate rearrangements and photoredox&#8208;promoted approaches, require stoichiometric activation of the acid unit to generate isocyanate or radical intermediates. Reported here is a process for the direct chemoselective decarboxylative amination of electron&#8208;poor arylacetates by oxidative Cu catalysis. The reaction proceeds at (or near) room temperature, uses native carboxylic acid starting materials, and is compatible with protic, electrophilic, and other potentially complicating functionality. Mechanistic studies support a pathway in which ionic decarboxylation of the acid generates a benzylic nucleophile which is aminated in a Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam&#8208;type process.

      <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Triply Fused Porphyrin&#8211;Graphene Nanoribbon Hybrids</title>
      <dc:description>
Made on the surface: A porphyrin&#8211;graphene nanoribbon hybrid is prepared by selective on&#8208;surface synthesis. The atomically precise structure of the hybrid is characterized by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy.

Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis offers a versatile approach to prepare novel carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that cannot be obtained by conventional solution chemistry. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have potential for a variety of applications. A key issue for their application in molecular electronics is in the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic properties through structural modifications, such as heteroatom doping or the incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid rings. In this context, the covalent fusion of GNRs and porphyrins (Pors) is a highly appealing strategy. Herein we present the selective on&#8208;surface synthesis of a Por&#8211;GNR hybrid, which consists of two Pors connected by a short GNR segment. The atomically precise structure of the Por&#8211;GNR hybrid has been characterized by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). The electronic properties have been investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), in combination with DFT calculations, which reveals a low electronic gap of 0.4&#8197;eV.

&lt;p&gt;On&#8208;surface synthesis offers a versatile approach to prepare novel carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that cannot be obtained by conventional solution chemistry. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have potential for a variety of applications. A key issue for their application in molecular electronics is in the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic properties through structural modifications, such as heteroatom doping or the incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid rings. In this context, the covalent fusion of GNRs and porphyrins (Pors) is a highly appealing strategy. Herein we present the selective on&#8208;surface synthesis of a Por&#8211;GNR hybrid, which consists of two Pors connected by a short GNR segment. The atomically precise structure of the Por&#8211;GNR hybrid has been characterized by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). The electronic properties have been investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), in combination with DFT calculations, which reveals a low electronic gap of 0.4&#8197;eV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tunable Thermoelastic Anisotropy in Hybrid Bragg Stacks with Extreme Polymer Confinement</title>
      <dc:description>
Hybrid Bragg stacks, consisting of alternating hectorite and polyvinylpyrrolidone layers, are fabricated with &#197;ngstrom precision. By controlling the sample composition, tunable mechanical and thermal anisotropy ratios, up to 7 and 38 respectively, are achieved.







Abstract
Controlling thermomechanical anisotropy is important for emerging heat management applications such as thermal interface and electronic packaging materials. Whereas many studies report on thermal transport in anisotropic nanocomposite materials, a fundamental understanding of the interplay between mechanical and thermal properties is missing, due to the lack of measurements of direction&#8208;dependent mechanical properties. In this work, exceptionally coherent and transparent hybrid Bragg stacks made of strictly alternating mica&#8208;type nanosheets (synthetic hectorite) and polymer layers (polyvinylpyrrolidone) were fabricated at large scale. Distinct from ordinary nanocomposites, these stacks display long&#8208;range periodicity, which is tunable down to angstrom precision. A large thermal transport anisotropy (up to 38) is consequently observed, with the high in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity (up to 5.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1) exhibiting an effective medium behavior. The unique hybrid material combined with advanced characterization techniques allows correlating the full elastic tensors to the direction&#8208;dependent thermal conductivities. We, therefore, provide a first analysis on how the direction&#8208;dependent Young's and shear moduli influence the flow of heat.

      <title>Atypical Hybrid Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs): A Combinative Process for MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Growth, Etching, and Structure Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
Well&#8208;designed atypical hybrid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique morphologies and complicated components are constructed with regulated combinations of three distinctive processes: MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF growth, etching, and structural transformation. The resulting hybrid MOFs are utilized as precursor materials for the generation of active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts.







Abstract
The structural, compositional, and morphological features of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) govern their properties and applications. Construction of hybrid MOFs with complicated structures, components, or morphologies is significant for the development of well&#8208;organized MOFs. An advanced route is reported for construction of atypical hybrid MOFs with unique morphologies and complicated components: 1)&#8197;MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF growth of a 3D zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) on a ZIF&#8208;L template, 2)&#8197;etching of a part of the 2D ZIF&#8208;L template, and 3)&#8197;structural transformation of 2D ZIF&#8208;L into 3D ZIF. The formation of core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF rings and plates is controlled by regulating the three processes. The formation route for the core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF rings and plates was monitored by tracking changes in morphology, structure, and composition. Carbon materials prepared from the pyrolysis of the core&#8211;shell&#8208;type hybrid MOFs displayed enhanced oxygen reduction reaction activities compared to their monomeric counterparts.

      <title>Bridging Small Molecules to Conjugated Polymers: Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with a Methyl&#8208;Substituted Phenylene Linker</title>
      <dc:description>
Tada! A new strategy is reported for the construction of conjugated polymers that allow efficient delayed fluorescence. As the number of methyl groups on the linker increases, the energy of the local excited triplet state (3LEb) can be tuned to surpass that of the charge&#8208;transfer triplet state (3CT). Consequently, the diminished TADF is recovered again, leading to a record&#8208;high EQE of 23.5&#8201;% and 20.9&#8201;% for the monochromic and warm white devices, respectively.







Abstract
Based on a &#8220;TADF + Linker&#8221; strategy (TADF=thermally activated delayed fluorescence), demonstrated here is the successful construction of conjugated polymers that allow highly efficient delayed fluorescence. Small molecular TADF blocks are linked together using a methyl&#8208;substituted phenylene linker to form polymers. With the growing number of methyl groups on the phenylene, the energy level of the local excited triplet state (3LEb) from the delocalized polymer backbone gradually increases, and finally surpasses the charge&#8208;transfer triplet state (3CT). As a result, the diminished delayed fluorescence can be recovered for the tetramethyl phenylene containing polymer, revealing a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.5&#8201;% (68.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 60.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.25, 0.52). Combined with an orange&#8208;red TADF emitter, a bright white electroluminescence is also obtained with a peak EQE of 20.9&#8201;% (61.1&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 56.4&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and CIE coordinates of (0.36, 0.51).

      <title>Engineering the Atomic Interface with Single Platinum Atoms for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>
Single Pt atoms assembled on a defective TiO2 support (Pt1/def&#8208;TiO2) as a highly efficient photocatalyst serve as proton reduction sites and promote the neighboring TiO2 units to generate surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of an atomic interface between the isolated Pt atom and Ti3+ defects. This unique structure endows Pt1/def&#8208;TiO2 with excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.







Abstract
It is highly desirable but challenging to optimize the structure of photocatalysts at the atomic scale to facilitate the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs for enhanced performance. Now, a highly efficient photocatalyst is formed by assembling single Pt atoms on a defective TiO2 support (Pt1/def&#8208;TiO2). Apart from being proton reduction sites, single Pt atoms promote the neighboring TiO2 units to generate surface oxygen vacancies and form a Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ti3+ atomic interface. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ti3+ atomic interface effectively facilitates photogenerated electrons to transfer from Ti3+ defective sites to single Pt atoms, thereby enhancing the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs. This unique structure makes Pt1/def&#8208;TiO2 exhibit a record&#8208;level photocatalytic hydrogen production performance with an unexpectedly high turnover frequency of 51423&#8197;h&#8722;1, exceeding the Pt nanoparticle supported TiO2 catalyst by a factor of 591.

Polyampholyte Janus&#8208;like microgels are synthesized using the controlled, electrostatically driven self&#8208;assembly and coacervation of growing, oppositely charged microgel precursors during precipitation polymerization. This enables the design of new drug carriers, switchable emulsion stabilizers, and adaptive catalyst carriers.







Abstract
Controlling the distribution of ionizable groups of opposite charge in microgels is an extremely challenging task, which could open new pathways to design a new generation of stimuli&#8208;responsive colloids. Herein, we report a straightforward approach for the synthesis of polyampholyte Janus&#8208;like microgels, where ionizable groups of opposite charge are located on different sides of the colloidal network. This synthesis approach is based on the controlled self&#8208;assembly of growing polyelectrolyte microgel precursors during the precipitation polymerization process. We confirmed the morphology of polyampholyte Janus&#8208;like microgels and demonstrate that they are capable of responding quickly to changes in both pH and temperature in aqueous solutions.

      <title>Multicomponent Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of an Inorganic Sulfur Dioxide Surrogate: Straightforward Construction of Diversely Functionalized Sulfones</title>
      <dc:description>
An inorganic salt is used for the multicomponent reductive cross&#8208;coupling for the straightforward construction of sulfones. Both intramolecular and intermolecular reductive cross&#8208;couplings were comprehensively explored, and diverse sulfones were accessible from the corresponding alkyl and aryl halides.







Abstract
Conventionally, sulfones are prepared by oxidation of sulfides with strong oxidants. Now, a multicomponent reductive cross&#8208;coupling involving an inorganic salt (sodium metabisulfite) for the straightforward construction of sulfones is disclosed. Both intramolecular and intermolecular reductive cross&#8208;couplings were comprehensively explored, and diverse sulfones were accessible from the corresponding alkyl and aryl halides. Intramolecular cyclic sulfones were systematically obtained from five&#8208; to twelve&#8208;membered rings. Naturally occurring aliphatic systems, such as steroids, saccharides, and amino acids, were highly compatible with the SO2&#8208;insertion reductive cross&#8208;coupling. Four clinically applied drug molecules, which include multiple heteroatoms and functional groups with active hydrogens, were successfully prepared via a late&#8208;stage SO2 insertion. Mechanistic studies show that alkyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals were both involved as intermediates in this transformation.

      <title>Pivotal Role of the Basic Character of Organic and Salt Catalysts in C&#8722;N Bond Forming Reactions of Amines with CO2</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide activation by amines leads to a range of C&#8722;N bond forming reactions. Most types of organocatalysts promote the reactions predominantly by acting as bases that stabilize formation of carbamate salts in the form [BaseH][RR&#8242;NCOO]. Alternative mechanistic roles of organocatalysts in CO2 based reactions with amines are extremely rare.







Abstract
Organocatalysts promote a range of C&#8722;N bond forming reactions of amines with CO2. Herein, we review these reactions and attempt to identify the unifying features of the catalysts that allows them to promote a multitude of seemingly unrelated reactions. Analysis of the literature shows that these reactions predominantly proceed by carbamate salt formation in the form [BaseH][RR&#8242;NCOO]. The anion of the carbamate salt acts as a nucleophile in hydrosilane reductions of CO2, internal cyclization reactions or after dehydration as an electrophile in the synthesis of urea derivatives. The reactions are enhanced by polar aprotic solvents and can be either promoted or hindered by H&#8208;bonding interactions. The predominant role of all types of organic and salt catalysts (including ionic liquids, ILs) is the stabilization of the carbamate salt, mostly by acting as a base. Catalytic enhancement depends on the combination of the amine, the base strength, the solvent, steric factors, ion pairing and H&#8208;bonding. A linear relationship between the base strength and the reaction yield has been demonstrated with IL catalysts in the synthesis of formamides and quinazoline&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones. The role of organocatalysts in the reactions indicates that all bases of sufficient strength should be able to catalyze the reactions. However, a physical limit to the extent of a purely base catalyzed reaction mechanism should exist, which needs to be identified, understood and overcome by synergistic or alternative methods.

      <title>Mechanochemistry for Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanochemical reactions by milling have emerged as a powerful, solvent&#8208;free synthesis tool in a wide range of areas. This Minireview provides a cross&#8208;section of ball milling in molecular and materials synthesis, highlighting recent developments such as enzyme catalysis, photo&#8208;mechanochemistry, catalysis, and medicinal mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free reactions by milling, grinding or other types of mechanical action have emerged as a viable alternative to solution chemistry. Mechanochemistry offers not only a possibility to eliminate the need for bulk solvent use, and reduce the generation of waste, but it also unlocks the door to a different reaction environment in which synthetic strategies, reactions and molecules previously not accessible in solution, can be achieved. This Minireview examines the potential of mechanochemistry in chemical and materials synthesis, by providing a cross&#8208;section of the recent developments in using ball milling for the formation of molecules and materials based on covalent and coordination bonds.

      <title>Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: Crystal Structures, Synthesis, Stabilities, and Optical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking the lead: This Review summarizes recent advances in widely studied lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanocrystals, centering on understanding their crystal structures, synthesis methods, environmental stability, and optical properties. The challenges in this rapidly evolving field and opportunities to further improve the quality and stability of these nanocrystals are also provided.







Abstract
In recent years, there have been rapid advances in the synthesis of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) for use in solar cells, light emitting diodes, lasers, and photodetectors. These compounds have a set of intriguing optical, excitonic, and charge transport properties, including outstanding photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and tunable optical band gap. However, the necessary inclusion of lead, a toxic element, raises a critical concern for future commercial development. To address the toxicity issue, intense recent research effort has been devoted to developing lead&#8208;free halide perovskite (LFHP) NCs. In this Review, we present a comprehensive overview of currently explored LFHP NCs with an emphasis on their crystal structures, synthesis, optical properties, and environmental stabilities (e.g., UV, heat, and moisture resistance). In addition, strategies for enhancing optical properties and stabilities of LFHP NCs as well as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are discussed. With the perspective of their properties and current challenges, we provide an outlook for future directions in this rapidly evolving field to achieve high&#8208;quality LFHP NCs for a broader range of fundamental research and practical applications.

      <title>Strain Release of Fused Pentagons in Fullerene Cages by Chemical Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking the strain: According to the isolated pentagon rule (IPR), fused pentagons in fullerene cages result in an increase in the local steric strain of the fullerene. The release of the strain arising from fused pentagons can be achieved by endohedral or exohedral functionalization. This Review gives an overview on fullerenes with fused pentagons, highlighting their role in the stability, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity of the fullerene cage.







Abstract
According to the isolated pentagon rule (IPR), for stable fullerenes, the 12 pentagons should be isolated from one another by hexagons, otherwise the fused pentagons will result in an increase in the local steric strain of the fullerene cage. However, the successful isolation of more than 100 endohedral and exohedral fullerenes containing fused pentagons over the past 20&#8197;years has shown that strain release of fused pentagons in fullerene cages is feasible. Herein, we present a general overview on fused&#8208;pentagon&#8208;containing (i.e. non&#8208;IPR) fullerenes through an exhaustive review of all the types of fused&#8208;pentagon&#8208;containing fullerenes reported to date. We clarify how the strain of fused pentagons can be released in different manners, and provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the role of fused pentagons in the stability, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity of fullerene cages.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Shift Bonding: A New and Unique Form of Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>
New description of valence bonding: The vertices of the triangle in the figure are labeled with the three variables of electron&#8208;pair bonding, &#934;cov&#8201;, &#934;ion&#8201;, and REcs (charge&#8208;shift resonance energy), which lead to three families of valence bonding, covalent, ionic, and charge&#8208;shift bonding, respectively. A variety of tricky bonding situations such as dative bonds, coordinative bonds, 3e&#8208;bonds, and hypervalent bonds can be best described by charge&#8208;shift bonding.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;shift bonds (CSBs) constitute a new class of bonds different than covalent/polar&#8208;covalent and ionic bonds. Bonding in CSBs does not arise from either the covalent or the ionic structures of the bond, but rather from the resonance interaction between the structures. This Essay describes the reasons why the CSB family was overlooked by valence&#8208;bond pioneers and then demonstrates that the unique status of CSBs is not theory&#8208;dependent. Thus, valence bond (VB), molecular orbital (MO), and energy decomposition analysis (EDA), as well as a variety of electron density theories all show the distinction of CSBs vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis covalent and ionic bonds. Furthermore, the covalent&#8211;ionic resonance energy can be quantified from experiment, and hence has the same essential status as resonance energies of organic molecules, e.g., benzene. The Essay ends by arguing that CSBs are a distinct family of bonding, with a potential to bring about a Renaissance in the mental map of the chemical bond, and to contribute to productive chemical diversity.

      <title>Structure and Properties of Violet Phosphorus and Its Phosphorene Exfoliation</title>
      <dc:description>
Violet phosphorus single crystals and violet phosphorene have been synthesized. The structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and observed by HRTEM. Violet phosphorus is more stable than black phosphorus. Violet phosphorene was obtained by mechanical and solvent exfoliation under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Black phosphorene has attracted much attention as a semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional material. Violet phosphorus is another layered semiconducting phosphorus allotrope with unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, no confirmed violet crystals or reliable lattice structure of violet phosphorus had been obtained. Now, violet phosphorus single crystals were produced and the lattice structure has been obtained by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction to be monoclinic with space group of P2/n (13) (a=9.210, b=9.128, c=21.893&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=97.776&#176;). The lattice structure obtained was confirmed to be reliable and stable. The optical band gap of violet phosphorus is around 1.7&#8197;eV, which is slightly larger than the calculated value. The thermal decomposition temperature was 52&#8201;&#176;C higher than its black phosphorus counterpart, which was assumed to be the most stable form. Violet phosphorene was easily obtained by both mechanical and solution exfoliation under ambient conditions.

      <title>Direct and Tandem Routes for the Copolymerization of Ethylene with Polar Functionalized Internal Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Being direct: Ethylene copolymerization with various 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ethylenes was realized through both a direct and tandem strategy. This work represents a step forward in terms of expanding the substrate scope for transition metal catalyzed ethylene copolymerization with polar&#8208;functionalized comonomers.







Abstract
Transition metal catalyzed ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers is a highly challenging reaction. After decades of research, the scope of suitable comonomer substrates has expanded from special to fundamental polar monomers and, recently, to 1,1&#8208;disubstituted ethylenes. Described in this contribution is a direct and tandem strategy to realize ethylene copolymerization with various 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ethylenes. The direct route is sensitive to sterics of both the comonomers and the catalyst. In the tandem route, ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ethenolysis can convert 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ethylenes into terminal olefins, which can be subsequently copolymerized with ethylene to afford polar functionalized polyolefins. The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step tandem route is highly versatile and efficient in dealing with challenging substrates. This work is a step forward in terms of expanding the substrate scope for transition metal catalyzed ethylene copolymerization with polar&#8208;functionalized comonomers.

      <title>A Photowelding Strategy for Conductivity Restoration in Flexible Circuits</title>
      <dc:description>
Mend and bend: Pentacene&#8208;based photocatalysis was applied to the conductivity restoration of flexible circuits (coined photowelding). Photoinduced charge separation and the resulting photocatalytic products generated near the locally irradiated superficial organic semiconductor layer enabled the agglomeration of the healing agent at the cracked area, thus leading to successful repair of the damaged circuit.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven micropumps, which are based on electro&#8208;osmosis with the electric field generated by photocatalytic reactions, are among most attractive research topics in chemical micromotors. Until now, research in this field has mainly been focused on the directional motion or collective behavior of microparticles, which lack practical applications. In this study, we have developed a photowelding strategy for repeated photoinduced conductivity recovery of cracked flexible circuits. We immersed the circuit in a suspension of conductive healing particles and applied photoillumination to the crack; photocatalysis of a predeposited pentacene (PEN) layer triggered electro&#8208;osmotic effects to gather conductive particles at the crack, thus leading to conductivity recovery of the circuit. This photowelding strategy is a novel application of light&#8208;driven micropumps and photocatalysis for conductivity restoration.

      <title>Electrochemical Vicinal Difluorination of Alkenes: Scalable and Amenable to Electron&#8208;Rich Substrates
</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorination for the nation: A method for the difluorination of unactivated alkenes with electron&#8208;rich functionalities is described. Key to success is the electrochemical generation of a hypervalent iodine mediator using an &#8220;ex&#8208;cell&#8221; approach, which avoids oxidative substrate decomposition.







Abstract
Fluorinated alkyl groups are important motifs in bioactive compounds, positively influencing pharmacokinetics, potency and conformation. The oxidative difluorination of alkenes represents an important strategy for their preparation, yet current methods are limited in their alkene&#8208;types and tolerance of electron&#8208;rich, readily oxidized functionalities, as well as in their safety and scalability. Herein, we report a method for the difluorination of a number of unactivated alkene&#8208;types that is tolerant of electron&#8208;rich functionality, giving products that are otherwise unattainable. Key to success is the electrochemical generation of a hypervalent iodine mediator using an &#8220;ex&#8208;cell&#8221; approach, which avoids oxidative substrate decomposition. The more sustainable conditions give good to excellent yields in up to decagram scales.

      <title>Enantioselective Copper(I)/Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Intramolecular Amination of Allylic and Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical control: The first radical&#8208;involved intramolecular enantioselective oxidative C&#8722;H amination of not only allylic substrates, but also benzylic substrates, by a hydrogen atom transfer process with a CuI/chiral phosphoric acid catalytic system is reported. Critical to the success is the use of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;PINO as a stable and chemoselective hydrogen abstractor.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved enantioselective oxidative C&#8722;H bond functionalization by a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) process has emerged as a promising method for accessing functionally diverse enantioenriched products, while asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H bond amination remains a formidable challenge. To address this problem, described herein is a dual CuI/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalytic system for radical&#8208;involved enantioselective intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of not only allylic positions but also benzylic positions with broad substrate scope. The use of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;NHPI (NHPI=N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide) as a stable and chemoselective HAT mediator precursor is crucial for the fulfillment of this transformation. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that a crucial allylic or benzylic radical intermediate resulting from a HAT process is involved.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes by Cooperative Cu/Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Arylboration of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
      <dc:description>
A cooperative Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;arylboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes was developed with excellent yields and enantioselectivities, and broad substrate scope. By employing this method, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted axially chiral allenes were prepared. Theoretical calculations indicate that the transmetallation of the allenylcopper species is the rate&#8208;limiting step of this transformation.







Abstract
A cooperative Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of multisubstituted allenes is established. By employing chiral sulfoxide phosphine (SOP)/Cu and PdCl2(dppf) complexes as catalysts, the 1,4&#8208;arylboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes provides an efficient approach to trisubstituted chiral allenes with up to 92&#8201;% yield and 97:3 er. Furthermore, by using 2&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;enynes as substrates, the tetrasubstituted chiral allenes were successfully generated using this strategy. Finally, theoretical calculations indicate that the transmetallation of the allenylcopper species is the rate&#8208;limiting step of this transformation.

      <title>Synthesis of Bridged Tetrahydrobenzo[b]azepines and Derivatives through an Aza&#8208;Piancatelli Cyclization/Michael Addition Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
Building bridges: For the first time, a unified approach to convert 2&#8208;furylcarbinols into bridged tetrahydrobenzo[b]azepines and related bridged compounds using amines as nucleophiles under mild conditions is disclose. The transformation demonstrates both a broad functional group tolerance and an excellent efficacy toward the preparation of densely functionalized molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report the preparation of bridged tetrahydrobenzo[b]azepines, which was accomplished through an aza&#8208;Piancatelli cyclization/Michael addition sequence in a one&#8208;pot fashion from readily available precursors. It is noteworthy that a general method to access these scaffolds was hitherto unprecedented. Additionally, the multifaceted aspects of this process have been exemplified through its application to the synthesis of 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes and bridged tetrahydrobenzo[b]oxepines, along with post&#8208;derivatizations.

      <title>Photoinduced Multiple Effects to Enhance Uranium Extraction from Natural Seawater by Black Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
A BP&#8208;PAO fiber enhanced by multiple photoinduced effects was fabricated by compositing black phosphorus (BP) nanosheet into the polyacrylamidoxime (PAO) fiber. The photocatalytic, photothermal, and photoelectric effects of the BP nanosheet endowed the BP&#8208;PAO fiber with high antibiofouling activity and enhanced uranium extraction capacity from natural seawater.







Abstract
Based on the photoinduced photothermal, photoelectric, and photocatalytic effects of black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, a BP&#8208;PAO fiber with enhanced uranium extraction capacity and high antibiofouling activity is fabricated by compositing BP nanosheets into polyacrylamidoxime (PAO). The photothermal effect increases the coordination interaction between UO22+ and the functional amidoxime group, and the photoelectric effect produces the surface positive electric field that exhibits electrostatic attraction to the negative [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, which all increase the capacity for uranium adsorption. The photocatalytic effect endows the adsorbent with high antibiofouling activity by producing biotoxic reactive oxygen species. Owing to these three photoinduced effects, the photoinduced BP&#8208;PAO fiber shows a high uranium adsorption capacity of 11.76&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 1.50 times of the PAO fiber, in bacteria&#8208;containing natural seawater.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Photoinduced Multiple Effects to Enhance Uranium Extraction from Natural Seawater by Black Phosphorus Nanosheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A BP&#8208;PAO fiber&lt;/b&gt; enhanced by multiple photoinduced effects was fabricated by compositing black phosphorus (BP) nanosheet into the polyacrylamidoxime (PAO) fiber. The photocatalytic, photothermal, and photoelectric effects of the BP nanosheet endowed the BP&#8208;PAO fiber with high antibiofouling activity and enhanced uranium extraction capacity from natural seawater.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the photoinduced photothermal, photoelectric, and photocatalytic effects of black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, a BP&#8208;PAO fiber with enhanced uranium extraction capacity and high antibiofouling activity is fabricated by compositing BP nanosheets into polyacrylamidoxime (PAO). The photothermal effect increases the coordination interaction between UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the functional amidoxime group, and the photoelectric effect produces the surface positive electric field that exhibits electrostatic attraction to the negative [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which all increase the capacity for uranium adsorption. The photocatalytic effect endows the adsorbent with high antibiofouling activity by producing biotoxic reactive oxygen species. Owing to these three photoinduced effects, the photoinduced BP&#8208;PAO fiber shows a high uranium adsorption capacity of 11.76&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 1.50 times of the PAO fiber, in bacteria&#8208;containing natural seawater.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functional 1&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles from Ethenesulfonyl Fluoride and Organic Azides</title>
      <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free click protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from organic azides and ethenesulfonyl fluoride (ESF) is described. The synthetic value of the concerted reaction is reflected in the simplicity of the protocol and demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot preparation of the triazoles on gram scale. The utility of this method is shown in the late&#8208;stage modification of several drugs, including the antibiotic chloramphenicol, giving rise a new active antibiotic derivative.







Abstract
The boom in growth of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted triazole products, in particular, since the early 2000&#8217;s, can be largely attributed to the birth of click chemistry and the discovery of the CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Yet the synthesis of relatively simple, albeit important, 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles has been surprisingly more challenging. Reported here is a straightforward and scalable click&#8208;inspired protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from organic azides and the bench stable acetylene surrogate ethenesulfonyl fluoride (ESF). The new transformation tolerates a wide selection of substrates and proceeds smoothly under metal&#8208;free conditions to give the products in excellent yield. Under controlled acidic conditions, the 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole products undergo a Michael addition reaction with a second equivalent of ESF to give the unprecedented 1&#8208;substituted triazolium sulfonyl fluoride salts.

      <dc:description>
2D c&#8208;MOF based organic spin valves: Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly was applied to fabricate highly crystalline and oriented thin films of 2D conductive MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2, on the La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) ferromagnetic electrode. A large magnetoresistance of 25&#8201;% for this LSMO/Cu3(HHTP)2/Co organic spin valve was achieved. This work demonstrates promising applications of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in spintronics.







Abstract
2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) feature promising applications as chemiresistive sensors, electrode materials, electrocatalysts, and electronic devices. However, exploration of the spin&#8208;polarized transport in this emerging materials and development of the relevant spintronics have not yet been implemented. In this work, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly was applied to fabricate highly crystalline and oriented thin films of a 2D c&#8208;MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2, (HHTP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), with tunable thicknesses on the La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) ferromagnetic electrode. The magnetoresistance (MR) of the LSMO/Cu3(HHTP)2/Co organic spin valves (OSVs) reaches up to 25&#8201;% at 10&#8197;K. The MR can be retained with good film thickness adaptability varied from 30 to 100&#8197;nm and also at high temperatures (up to 200&#8197;K). This work demonstrates the first potential applications of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in spintronics.

      <title>A Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Framework to Mediate Photodynamic Therapy and Deliver CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides to Enhance Antigen Presentation and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework, W&#8208;TBP, is used to facilitate tumor antigen presentation by enabling immunogenic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). The enhanced antigen presentation synergizes with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to expand and reinvigorate cytotoxic T cells, leading to 97&#8201;% tumor regression in a bilateral breast cancer model.







Abstract
Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) awakes a host innate immune system and reactivates cytotoxic T cells to elicit durable response in some cancer patients. Now, a cationic nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework, W&#8208;TBP, is used to facilitate tumor antigen presentation by enabling immunogenic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Comprised of dinuclear WVI secondary building units and photosensitizing 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) ligands, cationic W&#8208;TBP mediates PDT to release tumor associated antigens and delivers immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to DCs. The enhanced antigen presentation synergizes with CBI to expand and reinvigorate cytotoxic T cells, leading to superb anticancer efficacy and robust abscopal effects with &gt;97&#8201;% tumor regression in a bilateral breast cancer model.

      <title>Differential Adsorption of l&#8208; and d&#8208;Lysine on Achiral MFI Zeolites as Determined by Synchrotron X&#8208;Ray Powder Diffraction and Thermogravimetric Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Behavioural differences: Differential adsorption behaviour of l&#8208; and d&#8208;Lys over H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 has been observed experimentally by circular dichroism spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses. The fundamental reason is explained by structural studies based on SXRD data and the DFT calculations.







Abstract
Reported here is the first crystallographic observation of stereospecific bindings of l&#8208; and d&#8208;lysine (Lys) in achiral MFI zeolites. The MFI structure offers inherent geometric and internal confinement effects for the enantiomeric difference in l&#8208; and d&#8208;Lys adsorption. Notable differences have been observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Distinct l&#8208; and d&#8208;Lys adsorption behaviours on the H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 framework have been revealed by the Rietveld refinement of high&#8208;resolution synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (SXRD) data and the density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. Despite demonstrating the approach for l&#8208; and d&#8208;Lys over MFI zeolites at an atomistic resolution, the differential adsorption study sheds light on the rational engineering of molecular interaction(s) with achiral microporous materials for chiral separation purposes.

      <title>Single Chromium Atoms Supported on Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles for Synergic Catalytic Methane Conversion under Mild Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Single chromium atoms supported on titanium dioxide nanoparticles are an efficient synergistic heterogeneous catalyst. This system was used for direct methane oxidation to C1 oxygenated products with H2O2 as oxidant under mild conditions.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to value&#8208;added chemicals with high selectivity under mild conditions remains a great challenge in catalysis. Now, single chromium atoms supported on titanium dioxide nanoparticles are reported as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for direct methane oxidation to C1 oxygenated products with H2O2 as oxidant under mild conditions. The highest yield for C1 oxygenated products can be reached as 57.9&#8197;mol&#8201;molCr&#8722;1 with selectivity of around 93&#8201;% at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 20&#8197;h, which is significantly higher than those of most reported catalysts. The superior catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between single Cr atoms and TiO2 support. Combining catalytic kinetics, electron paramagnetic resonance, and control experiment results, the methane conversion mechanism was proposed as a methyl radical pathway to form CH3OH and CH3OOH first, and then the generated CH3OH is further oxidized to HOCH2OOH and HCOOH.

      <title>3D Electron Diffraction Unravels the New Zeolite ECNU&#8208;23 from the &#8220;Pure&#8221; Powder Sample of ECNU&#8208;21</title>
      <dc:description>
Use your ED: A new high&#8208;crystalline zeolite, ECNU&#8208;23, has been prepared with the assistance of the 3D electron&#8208;diffraction (ED) technique. The aluminosilicate Al&#8208;ECNU&#8208;23 shows unique catalytic properties in the isomerization/ disproportionation of m&#8208;xylene as solid&#8208;acid catalyst.







Abstract
A novel crystalline high&#8208;silica zeolite with 12&#215;8&#8208;membered ring (R) channel system is prepared with the aid of the 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) technique. A crystal with the same topology as one of the predicted daughter structures of CIT&#8208;13 germanosilicate, named ECNU&#8208;23 (East China Normal University 23) was coincidentally detected by the 3D ED investigation during the structure characterization of the &#8220;pure&#8221; powder sample of existing one&#8208;dimension (1D) 10&#8208;R ECNU&#8208;21. By controlling the alkaline&#8208;assisted hydrolysis under moderate conditions, we purified the phase of ECNU&#8208;23 by selectively breaking and removing the chemically weak Ge(Si)&#8208;O&#8208;Ge and metastable Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds. Its structure was determined based on the 3D ED data, and confirmed by high&#8208;resolution TEM images and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. The aluminosilicate Al&#8208;ECNU&#8208;23 shows unique catalytic properties in the isomerization/ disproportionation of m&#8208;xylene as solid&#8208;acid catalyst.

      <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Lithiation&#8211;Borylation of 2&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Oxirane: A Route to Versatile Tertiary Trifluoromethyl Boronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
Lithiation&#8211;borylation of 2,3&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoropropane has been developed for the stereospecific synthesis of enantioenriched tertiary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated boronic esters and their stereospecific conversion to a variety of fluorinated molecules bearing a chiral quaternary center is described.







Abstract
Stereogenic trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted carbon centers are highly sought&#8208;after moieties in pharmaceutical and agrochemical discovery. Here, we show that lithiation&#8211;borylation reactions of 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl oxirane give densely functionalized and highly versatile trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;tertiary boronic esters. The intermediate boronate complexes undergo the desired 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of the carbon&#8208;based group with complete retentive stereospecificity, a process that was only observed in non&#8208;polar solvents in the presence of TESOTf. Although the trifluoromethyl group adversely affects subsequent transformations of the &#945;&#8208;boryl group, Zweifel olefinations provide trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing quaternary stereocenters substituted with alkenes, alkynes and ketones.

      <title>Rational Synthesis of Amorphous Iron&#8208;Nickel Phosphonates for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Water Oxidation with Almost 100&#8201;% Yield</title>
      <dc:description>
DMF instead of water: A simple and rational approach was adopted to synthesize amorphous iron&#8208;nickel phosphonates. These deliver highly efficient photocatalytic water oxidation in almost nearly 100&#8201;% yield by limiting the &#8722;OH binding group using the solvent effect.







Abstract
A simple solvent ligation effect was successfully used to disrupt the growth of a model compound, Fe[(OH)(O3P(CH2)2CO2H)]&#8901;H2O (MIL&#8208;37), into an extended 2D structure by replacing water with dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent during the synthesis. Owing to the lack of &#8722;OH group, which provides the corner&#8208;sharing (binding) oxygen atoms for the octahedra, an amorphous and porous structure is formed. When Fe3+ is partially replaced by Ni2+, the amorphous structure remains and the resultant binary metal catalyst displays excellent photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity with almost 100&#8201;% yield achieved under visible light irradiation using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the photosensitizer. This study opens up new possibilities of using the simple solvent effect to synthesize high surface area metal phosphonates for catalytic and other applications.

      <title>Covalent Organic Framework (COF&#8208;1) under High Pressure</title>
      <dc:description>
Under pressure we're breaking: High&#8208;pressure synchrotron&#8208;radiation XRD and Raman experiments with mesitylene&#8208;filled and empty&#8208;pore COF&#8208;1 demonstrate the stability of the structure up to 12&#8211;15&#8197;GPa. Partial amorphization and a collapse of the framework is observed at higher pressure. Experimental bulk modulus and linear incompressibilities of COF&#8208;1 are useful for benchmarking theoretical descriptions of van der Waals interactions in solids.







Abstract
COF&#8208;1 has a structure with rigid 2D layers composed of benzene and B3O3 rings and weak van der Waals bonding between the layers. The as&#8208;synthesized COF&#8208;1 structure contains pores occupied by solvent molecules. A high surface area empty&#8208;pore structure is obtained after vacuum annealing. High&#8208;pressure XRD and Raman experiments with mesitylene&#8208;filled (COF&#8208;1&#8208;M) and empty&#8208;pore COF&#8208;1 demonstrate partial amorphization and collapse of the framework structure above 12&#8211;15&#8197;GPa. The ambient pressure structure of COF&#8208;1&#8208;M can be reversibly recovered after compression up to 10&#8211;15&#8197;GPa. Remarkable stability of highly porous COF&#8208;1 structure at pressures at least up to 10&#8197;GPa is found even for the empty&#8208;pore structure. The bulk modulus of the COF&#8208;1 structure (11.2(5)&#8197;GPa) and linear incompressibilities (k[100]=111(5)&#8197;GPa, k[001]=15.0(5)&#8197;GPa) were evaluated from the analysis of XRD data and cross&#8208;checked against first&#8208;principles calculations.

      <title>A Specific Blend of Drakolide and Hydroxymethylpyrazines: An Unusual Pollinator Sexual Attractant Used by the Endangered Orchid Drakaea micrantha</title>
      <dc:description>
Duping drakolide: The novel natural product Drakolide 3&#8201;c, together with the two hydroxymethylpyrazines 1 and 2, act as pollinator attractants in the endangered sexually deceptive hammer orchid Drakaea micrantha.







Abstract
Bioactive natural products underpin the intriguing pollination strategy used by sexually deceptive orchids. These compounds, which mimic the sex pheromones of the female insect, are emitted in particular blends to lure male insect pollinators of specific species. By combining methods from field biology, analytical chemistry, electrophysiology, crystallography, and organic synthesis, we report that an undescribed &#946;&#8208;hydroxylactone, in combination with two specific hydroxymethylpyrazines, act as pollinator attractants in the rare hammer orchid Drakaea micrantha. This discovery represents an unusual case of chemically unrelated compounds being used together as a sexual attractant. Furthermore, this is the first example of the identification of pollinator attractants in an endangered orchid, enabling the use of chemistry in orchid conservation. Our synthetic blend is now available to be used in pollinator surveys to locate suitable sites for plant conservation translocations.

      <title>Bridge&#8208;Clamp Bis(tetrazine)s with [N]8 &#960;&#8208;Stacking Interactions and Azido&#8208;s&#8208;Aryl Tetrazines: Two Classes of Doubly Clickable Tetrazines</title>
      <dc:description>
A double&#8208;double! Two new complementary classes of s&#8208;aryl tetrazines are presented with two independently and selectively clickable functions. Constraints at the ortho&#8208;positions generate unprecedented structural features such as [N]8 London dispersion forces.







Abstract
Click chemistry at a tetrazine core is useful for bioorthogonal labeling and crosslinking. Introduced here are two new classes of doubly clickable s&#8208;aryl tetrazines synthesized by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Homocoupling of o&#8208;brominated s&#8208;aryl tetrazines leads to bis(tetrazine)s structurally characterized by tetrazine cores arranged face&#8208;to&#8208;face. [N]8 &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions are essential to the conformation. Upon inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) cycloaddition, the bis(tetrazine)s produce a unique staple structure. The o&#8208;azidation of s&#8208;aryl tetrazines introduces a second proximal intermolecular clickable function that leads to double click chemistry opportunities. The stepwise introduction of fluorophores and then iEDDA cycloaddition, including bioconjugation to antibodies, was achieved on this class of tetrazines. This method extends to (thio)etherification, phosphination, trifluoromethylation and the introduction of various bioactive nitrogen&#8208;based heterocycles.

      <title>Ultrafast Condensation of Carbon Nitride on Electrodes with Exceptional Boosted Photocurrent and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrafast heating addresses the thermodynamic contradiction of precursor volatilization during polymerization and leads to strongly adhesive carbon nitride on electrodes with a gradient C&#8208;rich texture. Charge separation and mobility are accelerated and a remarkable photocurrent and a record cathodic electrochemiluminescence efficiency are observed.







Abstract
Semiconducting polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has drawn wide attention ranging from photocatalysis to more recent biosensing owing to unique defect&#8208;tolerated optoelectronic properties and being metal&#8208;free, cheap, and highly stable. However, at the core of electrical&#8211;optical interconversion, the preparation of the CN photoelectrode is still challenging. Now, the growth of CN on electrodes is achieved simply by microwave&#8208;assisted condensation in seconds. The ultrafast heating not only addressed the thermodynamic contradiction of precursor volatilization during polymerization but also led to strongly adhesive CN layer on electrodes with gradient carbon&#8208;rich texture, greatly accelerating the electron&#8211;hole separation and mobility. Consequently, the CN photoelectrode exhibited a remarkable photocurrent and a record cathodic efficiency of electrochemiluminescence up to 7 times that of benchmark Ru(bpy)3Cl2 in aqueous solution.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenyl Carboxylates: A Gateway to 1,2,3&#8208;Trifunctionalized Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
Easy as 1, 2, 3: Under nickel catalysis, alkenyl carboxylic acids undergo selective 1,2&#8208;diarylation. The resulting products can then be readily converted into diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalized motifs via classical carboxylic acid interconversions and modern decarboxylative cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl carboxylic acids, aryl iodides, and aryl/alkenyl boronic esters is reported. The reaction delivers the desired 1,2&#8208;diarylated and 1,2&#8208;arylalkenylated products with excellent regiocontrol. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the method, a representative product is prepared on gram scale and then diversified to eight 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalized building blocks using two&#8208;electron and one&#8208;electron logic. Using this method, three routes toward bioactive molecules are improved in terms of yield and/or step count. This method represents the first example of catalytic 1,2&#8208;diarylation of an alkene directed by a native carboxylate group.

The resulting products can then be readily converted into diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalized motifs via classical carboxylic acid interconversions and modern decarboxylative cross&#8208;couplings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nickel&#8208;catalyzed conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl carboxylic acids, aryl iodides, and aryl/alkenyl boronic esters is reported. The reaction delivers the desired 1,2&#8208;diarylated and 1,2&#8208;arylalkenylated products with excellent regiocontrol. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the method, a representative product is prepared on gram scale and then diversified to eight 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalized building blocks using two&#8208;electron and one&#8208;electron logic. Using this method, three routes toward bioactive molecules are improved in terms of yield and/or step count. This method represents the first example of catalytic 1,2&#8208;diarylation of an alkene directed by a native carboxylate group.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxodealkenylative Cleavage of Alkene C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Bonds: A Practical Method for Introducing Carbonyls into Chiral Pool Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot protocol for the introduction of carbonyl functionalities into terpenes proceeds by Criegee ozonolysis of an alkene, reductive cleavage of the resulting &#945;&#8208;alkoxy hydroperoxides, trapping of the generated alkyl radical with TEMPO, and subsequent oxidative fragmentation with magnesium bis(monoperoxyphthalate) hexahydrate (MMPP).

Abstract
Reported herein is a one&#8208;pot protocol for the oxodealkenylative introduction of carbonyl functionalities into terpenes and terpene&#8208;derived compounds. This transformation proceeds by Criegee ozonolysis of an alkene, reductive cleavage of the resulting &#945;&#8208;alkoxy hydroperoxide, trapping of the generated alkyl radical with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl (TEMPO), and subsequent oxidative fragmentation with MMPP. Using readily available starting materials from chiral pool, a variety of carbonyl&#8208;containing products have been accessed rapidly in good yields.

      <title>Robust Synthesis of Gold&#8208;Based Multishell Structures as Plasmonic Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of 4&#8208;Nitrostyrene</title>
      <dc:description>
A robust self&#8208;template strategy is used for the facile synthesis of an Au&#8208;based multishell structure with controllable shell number, metal component, and sphere size. In NH3&#8901;BH3&#8208;initiated hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene to 4&#8208;aminostyrene, the surface&#8208;modified multishell Au displays enhanced plasmonic catalysis activity and excellent selectivity.







Abstract
A robust self&#8208;template strategy is used for facile and large&#8208;scale synthesis of porous multishell gold with controllable shell number, sphere size, and in&#8197;situ surface modification. The process involved the rapid reduction of novel Au&#8208;melamine colloidal templates with a great amount of NaBH4 in presence of poly(sodium&#8208;p&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS). After soaking the templates in other metal salt solution, the obtained bimetallic templates could also be generally converted into bimetallic multishell structures by same reduction process. In the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene using NH3BH3 as a reducing agent, the porous triple&#8208;shell Au with surface modification (S&#8208;PTSAu) exhibited excellent selectivity (97&#8201;%) for 4&#8208;aminostyrene in contrast with unmodified triple&#8208;shell Au. Furthermore, it also showed higher enhancement of catalytic activity under irradiation of visible light as compared to similar catalysts with fewer shells.

      <title>Nanoparticle Size&#8208;Fractionation through Self&#8208;Standing Porous Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Panning for (nano)gold: A strategic approach to design self&#8208;standing, covalent organic framework (COF) films with high permeability is reported for the size&#8208;selective fractionation of gold nanoparticles. The vertical nanochannels of the COF pores allow selective passage of the nanoparticles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted attention due to their ordered pores leading to important industrial applications like storage and separation. Combined with their modular synthesis and pore engineering, COFs could become ideal candidates for nanoseparations. However, the fabrication of these microcrystalline powders as continuous, crack&#8208;free, robust films remains a challenge. Herein, we report a simple, slow annealing strategy to construct centimeter&#8208;scale COF films (Tp&#8208;Azo and Tp&#8208;TTA) with micrometer thickness. The as&#8208;synthesized films are porous (SABET=2033&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Tp&#8208;Azo) and chemically stable. These COFs have distinct size cut&#8208;offs (ca. 2.7 and ca. 1.6&#8197;nm for Tp&#8208;Azo and Tp&#8208;TTA, respectively), which allow the size&#8208;selective separation of gold nanoparticles. Unlike, other conventional membranes, the durable structure of the COF films allow for excellent recyclability (up to 4 consecutive cycles) and easy recovery of the gold nanoparticles from the solution.

      <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfone&#8208;Bearing Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
The first general example of regio&#8208; and enantioselective palladium catalyzed allylic sulfonylation of vinyl cyclic carbonates provides an efficient and direct way to construct sulfone&#8208;bearing quaternary carbon stereocenters. A three steps formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;agelasidine&#8197;A is achieved which exemplifies the practical use of this protocol in a synthetic setting.







Abstract
Chiral sulfones are of great importance in medicinal chemistry and chemical synthesis. Efficient methods for preparing enantiomerically enriched sulfone&#8208;containing molecules can therefore be of significant value; such methods, however, are uncommon. Herein, we report the first general palladium&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of vinyl cyclic carbonates with sodium sulfinates. A series of enantiomerically enriched tertiary allylic sulfones were synthesized in good yields with excellent enantiomeric ratios. Both aliphatic&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates are suitable reactants with excellent results. This reaction features broad substrates scope, readily available starting materials, excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and synthesis of sulfone&#8208;bearing quaternary carbon stereocenters. Through the sulfonylation of geranyl derived cyclic carbonate 1&#8201;h, we achieve the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;agelasidine&#8197;A.
