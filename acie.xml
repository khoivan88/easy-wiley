      <title>New Radical Borylation Pathways for Organoboron Synthesis Enabled by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Radical borylation using  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;BH  3  complexes as boryl radical precursors has emerged as an important synthetic tool for organoboron assembly. However, the majority of reported methods are limited to reaction modes involving carbo&#8208; and/or hydroboration of specific alkenes and alkynes. Moreover, the generation of NHC&#8208;boryl radicals relies principally on hydrogen atom abstraction with the aid of radical initiators. Herein, we report a fundamentally distinct radical generation method, as well as reaction pathways of NHC&#8208;boryl radicals enabled by photoredox catalysis. NHC&#8208;boryl radicals are generated via a single&#8208;electron oxidation, and subsequently undergo cross&#8208;coupling with the  in situ  generated radical anions, affording  gem  &#8208;difluoroallylboronates following the expulsion of a fluoride ion. Moreover, an appealing photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical arylboration reaction of alkenes using cyanoarenes as arylating components has been accomplished, from which extensively elaborated organoborons can be accessed from simple starting materials. Mechanistic studies verified the oxidative formation of NHC&#8208;boryl radicals through a single&#8208;electron transfer pathway. These photoredox catalytic modes of operation open up new avenues for the synthesis of densely functionalized organoborons.</dc:description>

      <title>From K&#8208;O2 to K&#8208;Air Batteries: Realizing Superoxide Batteries on the Basis of Dry Ambient Air</title>
      <dc:description>Superoxide &#8208;based potassium&#8208;oxygen (K&#8208;O  2  ) batteries have demonstrated enormous potential to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery chemistry with low round&#8208;trip overpotentials . Although using air cathode is the ultimate goal to unlock the full potential of superoxide batteries, prior studies were limited to pure oxygen. Herein, we report the first K&#8208;air battery based on reversible superoxide electrochemistry . Spectroscopic and gas chromatography analyses are applied to evaluate the reactivity of KO  2  in ambient air. Despite that KO  2  reacts with water vapor and CO  2  to form KHCO  3  , it is found to be highly stable in dry air. With this knowledge, rechargeable K&#8208;air batteries were successfully demonstrated by employing dry air cathode. We further prove that the reduced partial pressure of oxygen plays a critical role in boosting the battery lifespan. With a more stable environment for K anode, a K&#8208;air battery delivers over 100 cycles (&gt; 500 hours) with low round&#8208;trip overpotentials and high coulombic efficiencies as opposed to traditional K&#8208;O  2  battery that fails at an early stage. This work sheds light on the benefits and restrictions of employing air cathode in superoxide &#8208;based batteries, and will be of use for the development of practical metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Gamma&#8208;Rays Irradiation Accelerates Crystallization of Mesoporous Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are widely employed in the industry, and typically synthesized under hydrothermal condition for a relatively long crystallization time. However, there is still a big challenge for the fast synthesis of mesoporous zeolites with enhanced mass transfer. Herein, for the first time, Gamma rays (&#947;&#8208;rays) irradiation was introduced into zeolite synthesis. It was found that the crystallization process of zeolite NaA, NaY, Silicalite&#8208;1 and ZSM&#8208;5 were greatly accelearted. The crystallization time of NaA zeolite was significantly decreased to 18 h under &#947;&#8208;rays irradiation at 20&#160;&#160; o  C, while more than 102 h was needed for the conventional process. Unexpectedly, more mesopores were created during this process, and thus the adsorption capacity of CO  2  increased extraordinarily by 6&#8208;fold compared to the NaA prepared without &#947;&#8208;rays irradiation. Solid experimental evidences and density function theory (DFT) calculations domonstrated that hydroxyl free radicals (OH*) generated by &#947;&#8208;rays greatly accelerated the crystallization of zeolite NaA. Besides NaA, mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 with MFI topology was also successfully synthesized under &#947;&#8208;rays irradiation, which possessed excellent catalytic performance for methanol conversion, suggesting the universality of this new synthetic strategy for various zeolites.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiple Light Control Mechanisms in ATP&#8208;fueled Non&#8208;Equilibrium DNA Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Fuel&#8208;driven self&#8208;assemblies are gaining ground for creating autonomous systems and materials, whose temporal behavior is preprogrammed by a reaction network. However, up to now there is a lack of simple external control mechanisms of the transient behavior, at best using remote and benign light control. Even more challenging is to use different wavelengths to modulate different components of the system, such as fuel or building blocks. Success would enable such systems to navigate along different trajectories in a wavelength&#8208;dependent fashion. Herein, we introduce the first examples of light control in ATP&#8208;fueled, dynamic covalent DNA polymerization systems organized in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction. We demonstrate concepts for light&#8208;activation and &#8208;modulation by introducing caged ATP derivatives and caged DNA building blocks, enabling to realize light&#8208;activated fueling, self&#8208;sorting in structure and behavior, and transition across different wavelength&#8208;dependent dynamic steady states.</dc:description>

This result led to the formation of unprecedented multi&#8208;layered nanocomposite microgels, which promise substantial potential in colloidal applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Label&#8208;free Nanoimaging of Neuromelanin in the Brain by Soft X&#8208;ray Spectromicroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>A hallmark of Parkinson&#8217;s disease is the death of neuromelanin&#8208;pigmented neurons, but the role of neuromelanin is unclear. Lack of a neuromelanin&#8208;specific marker was highlighted over 30 years ago, yet  in&#8208;situ  characterization of neuromelanin remains dependent on detectable pigmentation, rather than direct quantification of neuromelanin. We show that direct, label&#8208;free nanoscale visualization of neuromelanin and associated metal ions in human brain tissue can be achieved using synchrotron Scanning Transmission X&#8208;ray Microscopy (STXM), via a characteristic feature in the neuromelanin x&#8208;ray absorption spectrum at 287.4 eV that is also present in iron&#8208;free and iron&#8208;laden synthetic neuromelanin. This is confirmed in consecutive brain sections by correlating STXM neuromelanin imaging with silver nitrate&#8208;stained neuromelanin. Analysis suggests that the 1s &#8208; &#963;* (C&#8208;S) transition in benzothiazine groups accounts for this feature. This advance in visualizing neuromelanin illustrates the wider potential of STXM as a label&#8208;free spectromicroscopy technique applicable to both organic and inorganic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Discrete Hf18 Metal&#8208;oxo Cluster as a Heterogeneous Nanozyme for Site&#8208;Specific Proteolysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A hafnium enzyme is better than none: The discrete hafnium metal&#8208;oxo cluster [Hf18O10(OH)26(SO4)13&#8901;(H2O)33] (Hf18) acts as a nanozyme for the strictly selective hydrolysis of horse heart myoglobin (HHM) at Asp residues.







Abstract
The selective hydrolysis of proteins by non&#8208;enzymatic catalysis is difficult to achieve, yet it is crucial for applications in biotechnology and proteomics. Herein, we report that discrete hafnium metal&#8208;oxo cluster [Hf18O10(OH)26(SO4)13&#8901;(H2O)33] (Hf18), which is centred by the same hexamer motif found in many MOFs, acts as a heterogeneous catalyst for the efficient hydrolysis of horse heart myoglobin (HHM) in low buffer concentrations. Among 154 amino acids present in the sequence of HHM, strictly selective cleavage at only 6 solvent accessible aspartate residues was observed. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the hydrolytic activity is likely derived from the actuation of HfIV Lewis acidic sites and the Br&#248;nsted acidic surface of Hf18. X&#8208;ray scattering and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that Hf18 is completely insoluble in these conditions, confirming the HHM hydrolysis is caused by a heterogeneous reaction of the solid Hf18 cluster, and not from smaller, soluble Hf species that could leach into solution.

      <title>Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction on Neighboring Zn/Co Monomers via Electronic Effect</title>
      <dc:description>It&#8217;s of great significance to reveal the detailed mechanism of neighboring effects between monomers, as they could not only affect the intermediate bonding but also change the reaction pathway. This paper describes the electronic effect between neighboring Zn/Co monomers effectively promoting CO  2  electroreduction to CO. Zn and Co atoms coordinated on N doped carbon (ZnCoNC) shows a CO faradaic efficiency of 93.2% at &#8208;0.5 V vs. RHE during a 30&#8208;hours test. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements (EXAFS) indicated no direct metal&#8208;metal bonding and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) showed the electronic effect between Zn/Co monomers. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the electronic effect between Zn/Co enhanced the *COOH intermediate bonding on Zn sites and thus promoted CO production. This work could act as a promising way to reveal the mechanism of neighboring monomers and to manipulate catalysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Recent advances in scanning probe microscopy on surface enable not only direct observation of molecular structures but also local probe reactions, in which unstable short&#8208;lived products have been synthesized and analyzed.

      <title>Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Reversible Thiolate/Disulfide Conversion as a Mimic for a Key Step of the Catalytic Cycle of Methyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;M Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>
Thiolate/disulfide conversions are mediated by nickel complexes mimicking the key step in the catalytic cycle of methyl&#8208;coenzyme&#8197;M reductase. Cyclic voltammetry and EPR spectroscopic measurements reveal monoradical&#8208;based reversible switching of NiII&#8208;thiolate/NiII&#8208;disulfide couples (see picture).







Abstract
According to the well&#8208;accepted mechanism, methyl&#8208;coenzyme&#8197;M reductase (MCR) involves Ni&#8208;mediated thiolate&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversion that sustains its catalytic cycle of methane formation in the energy saving pathways of methanotrophic microbes. Model complexes that illustrate Ni&#8208;ion mediated reversible thiolate/disulfide transformation are unknown. In this paper we report the synthesis, crystal structure, spectroscopic properties and redox interconversions of a set of NiII complexes comprising a tridentate N2S donor thiol and its analogous N4S2 donor disulfide ligands. These complexes demonstrate reversible NiII&#8208;thiolate/NiII&#8208;disulfide (both bound and unbound disulfide&#8208;S to NiII) transformations via thiyl and disulfide monoradical anions that resemble a primary step of MCR's catalytic cycle.

      <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Based Homolytic Substitution Observed for the Radical SAM Enzyme HemN</title>
      <dc:description>
Play it, SAM: A sulfonium&#8208;based homolytic substitution (SH) reaction was observed in the reaction of the radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme HemN. DFT calculations and model reactions showed that this type of chemistry is thermodynamically favorable and could be further explored in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;based homolytic substitution (SH reaction) plays an important role in synthetic chemistry, yet whether such a reaction could occur on the positively charged sulfonium compounds remains unknown. In the study of the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN, a radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis, we observed the production of di&#8208;(5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl)methylsulfonium, which supports a deoxyadenosyl (dAdo) radical&#8208;mediated SH reaction on the sulfonium center of SAM. The sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions were then investigated in detail by density functional theory calculations and model reactions, which showed that this type of reactions is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically competent. These findings represent the first report of sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions, which could be useful in synthetic chemistry. Our study also demonstrates the remarkable catalytic promiscuity of the radical SAM superfamily enzymes.

These findings represent the first report of sulfonium&#8208;based S&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; reactions, which could be useful in synthetic chemistry. Our study also demonstrates the remarkable catalytic promiscuity of the radical SAM superfamily enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intracellular Reactions Promoted by Bis(histidine) Miniproteins Stapled Using Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Cell entry: A palladium(II)&#8208;stapled bis(histidine) unit at the basic site of miniproteins leads to cell&#8208;permeable derivatives that enable depropargylation reactions within the interior of living mammalian cells. Both the metal bridge and the peptide scaffolding are essential for the internalization, and for observing the intracellular transformations.







Abstract
The generation of catalytically active metalloproteins inside living mammalian cells is a major research challenge at the interface between catalysis and cell biology. Herein we demonstrate that basic domains of bZIP transcription factors, mutated to include two histidine residues at i and i+4 positions, react with palladium(II) sources to generate catalytically active, stapled pallado&#8208;miniproteins. The resulting constrained peptides are efficiently internalized into living mammalian cells, where they perform palladium&#8208;promoted depropargylation reactions without cellular fixation. Control experiments confirm the requirement of the peptide scaffolding and the palladium staple for attaining the intracellular reactivity.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Sulfonamides With (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
      <dc:description>
Ancillary Ligation: The development of the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocols for the cross&#8208;coupling of sulfonamides with inexpensive and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides and phenol derivatives is enabled by use of appropriate bisphosphine ligation.







Abstract
The development of Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides is reported. These transformations, which were previously achievable only with Pd catalysis, are enabled by use of air&#8208;stable (L)NiCl(o&#8208;tol) pre&#8208;catalysts (L=PhPAd&#8208;DalPhos and PAd2&#8208;DalPhos), without photocatalysis. The collective scope of (pseudo)halide electrophiles (X=Cl, Br, I, OTs, and OC(O)NEt2) demonstrated herein is unprecedented for any reported catalyst system for sulfonamide C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling (Pd, Cu, Ni, or other). Preliminary competition experiments and relevant coordination chemistry studies are also presented.

      <title>Spectroscopies and Electron Microscopies Unravel the Origin of the First Colour Photographs
</title>
      <dc:description>
The pigment hypothesis and the interferences hypothesis suggested in the XIXth century in order to explain the colours of photochromatic images are discarded. The silver nanoparticles dispersions contained in the silver chloride matrix forming Becquerel images seem to be colour&#8208;characteristic, indicating a plasmonic origin of the photochromatic images colours.







Abstract
The first colour photographs were created by a process introduced by Edmond Becquerel in 1848. The nature of these photochromatic images colours motivated a debate between scientists during the XIXth century, which is still not settled. We present the results of chemical analysis (EDX, HAXPES and EXAFS) and morphology studies (SEM, STEM) aiming at explaining the optical properties of the photochromatic images (UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and low loss EELS). We rule out the two hypotheses (pigment and interferences) that have prevailed since 1848, respectively based on variations in the oxidation degree of the compound forming the sensitized layer and periodically spaced photolytic silver planes. A study of the silver nanoparticles dispersions contained in the coloured layers showed specific localizations and sizes distributions of the nanoparticles for each colour. These results allow us to formulate a plasmonic hypothesis on the origin of the photochromatic images colours.

      <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Organometallic Intermediates Relevant to Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation</title>
      <dc:description>
The 18&#8208;electron cobalt hydride (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)2H has been synthesized. Despite being coordinatively saturated this compound promotes reversible 2,1&#8208;insertion of styrene and catalytic hydrogenation, raising questions as to the mechanism of action of the modified cobalt catalysts.







Abstract
Intermediates relevant to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroformylation have been isolated and evaluated in fundamental organometallic transformations relevant to aldehyde formation. The 18&#8208;electron (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)2H has been structurally characterized, and it promotes exclusive hydrogenation of styrene in the presence of 50&#8197;bar of H2/CO gas (1:1) at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies established reversible 2,1&#8208;insertion of styrene into the Co&#8722;D bond of (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)2D. Whereas rapid &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination from cobalt alkyls occurred under an N2 atmosphere, alkylation of (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)2Cl in the presence of CO enabled the interception of (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)2C(O)CH2CH2Ph, which upon hydrogenolysis under 4&#8197;atm H2 produced the corresponding aldehyde and cobalt hydride, demonstrating the feasibility of elementary steps in hydroformylation. Both the hydride and chloride derivatives, (X=H&#8722;, Cl&#8722;), underwent exchange with free 13CO. Under reduced pressure, (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)2Cl underwent CO dissociation to form (R,R)&#8208;(iPrDuPhos)Co(CO)Cl.

      <title>Two Distinct Structures of Membrane&#8208;associated Homodimers of GTP&#8208; and GDP&#8208;bound KRAS4B Revealed by Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>KRAS homo&#8208;dimerization has been implicated in the activation of RAF kinases, however, the mechanism and structural basis remain elusive. We developed a system to study KRAS dimerization on nanodiscs using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, and determined distinct structures of membrane&#8208;anchored KRAS dimers in the active GTP&#8208; and inactive GDP&#8208;loaded states. Both dimerize through an &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, but the relative orientation of the protomers and their contacts differ substantially. Dimerization of KRAS&#8208;GTP, stabilized by electrostatic interactions between R135 and E168, favours an orientation on the membrane that promotes accessibility of the effector&#8208;binding site. Remarkably, &#8216;cross&#8217;&#8208;dimerization between GTP&#8208; and GDP&#8208;bound KRAS molecules is unfavorable. These models provide a vital platform to elucidate the structural basis of RAF activation by RAS and to develop newer inhibitors that can disrupt the KRAS dimerization. The methodology developed to specifically probe the intermolecular interactions within KRAS dimer is applicable to many other farnesylated small GTPases.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;KRAS homo&#8208;dimerization has been implicated in the activation of RAF kinases, however, the mechanism and structural basis remain elusive. We developed a system to study KRAS dimerization on nanodiscs using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, and determined distinct structures of membrane&#8208;anchored KRAS dimers in the active GTP&#8208; and inactive GDP&#8208;loaded states. Both dimerize through an &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, but the relative orientation of the protomers and their contacts differ substantially. Dimerization of KRAS&#8208;GTP, stabilized by electrostatic interactions between R135 and E168, favours an orientation on the membrane that promotes accessibility of the effector&#8208;binding site. Remarkably, &#8216;cross&#8217;&#8208;dimerization between GTP&#8208; and GDP&#8208;bound KRAS molecules is unfavorable. These models provide a vital platform to elucidate the structural basis of RAF activation by RAS and to develop newer inhibitors that can disrupt the KRAS dimerization. The methodology developed to specifically probe the intermolecular interactions within KRAS dimer is applicable to many other farnesylated small GTPases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Secondary Amino Alcohols: Traceless Cleavable Linkers for Use in Affinity Capture and Release</title>
      <dc:description>Capture and release of peptides is often a critical operation in the pathway to discovering materials with novel functions. However, the best methods for efficient capture impede facile release. To overcome this challenge, we report secondary amino alcohol&#8208;based linkers for release of peptides after capture. These amino alcohols are based on serine (seramox) or isoserine (isoseramox) and can be incorporated into peptides during solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis via reductive amination. Both linkers are quantitatively cleaved within minutes under NaIO  4  treatment. Cleavage of isoseramox produced a native peptide  N  &#8208;terminus. This linker also showed broad substrate compatibility; incorporation into a synthetic peptide library resulted in the identification of all sequences by nanoLC&#8208;MS/MS. The linkers are cell compatible; a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide that contained this linker was efficiently captured and identified after uptake into cells. These findings suggest secondary amino alcohol&#8208;based linkers might be suitable tools for peptide discovery platforms.</dc:description>

      <title>Distance synergy of MoS2&#8208;confined Rh atoms for highly efficient hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Perturbing the electronic structure of MoS2  basal plane via confining heteroatoms offers the opportunity to trigger in&#8208;plane activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The key challenge consists in inducing the optimum HER activity by controlling the type and distribution of confined atoms. Herein, we report a distance synergy of MoS2&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom rhodium realizing an ultra&#8208;high HER activity at the in&#8208;plane S sites adjacent to the rhodium. By optimizing the distance between the confined Rh atoms, an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 67 mV is achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in acidic solution. Experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate a unique distance synergy between the confined rhodium atoms in tuning the reactivity of neighbouring in&#8208;plane S atoms, which presents a volcanic trend with the inter&#8208;rhodium distance. This study provides a new strategy to tailor the activity of MoS2  surface via modulating the distance between confined single atoms.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Through quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we investigate a family of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing triazolate linkers, M  2  X  2  (BBTA) (M = metal, X = bridging anion, H  2  BBTA = 1  H  ,5  H  &#8208;benzo(1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d&#8242;)bistriazole), for their ability to form terminal metal&#8208;oxo sites and subsequently activate the C&#8722;H bond of methane. By varying the metal and bridging anion in the framework, we show how to significantly tune the reactivity of this series of MOFs.

      <dc:description>Stiff&#8208;stilbene, a sterically restricted fused ring analogue of stilbene, has been regularly used as a model compound in theoretical studies of stilbene photoisomerization. Lately, owing to its excellent photoswitching properties, it is increasingly being applied to reversibly control the properties and function of chemical as well as biological systems. Stiff stilbene photoswitches possess a number of advantageous properties including a high quantum yield for photoisomerization and a high thermal stability.

      <title>Multi&#8208;electron reactions enabled by anion&#8208;participated redox chemistry for high&#8208;energy multivalent rechargeable batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Intense research efforts in electrochemical energy storage are being devoted to multivalent ion technologies in order to meet the growing demands for high energy and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. However, the development of multivalent metal (such as Mg and Ca) based battery systems is hindered by lack of suitable cathode chemistries that show well reversible multi&#8208;electron redox reactions. Cationic redox centers in the classical cathodes could only afford stepwise single electron transfer, which we believe are not ideal for multivalent ion storage. The possible local charge balance issue would set additional kinetic barrier for ion mobility. Therefore, most of the multivalent battery cathodes only exhibit slope&#8208;like voltage profiles with insertion/extraction redox of less than one electron. To address this issue, we propose to activate anionic redox chemistry enabling multi&#8208;electron transfer in insertion cathodes for high&#8208;energy multivalent batteries. Taking VS  4  as a model material, reversible two&#8208;electron redox with synergetic cationic&#8208;anionic contribution has been verified in both rechargeable Mg batteries (RMBs) and rechargeable Ca batteries (RCBs). The corresponding cells exhibit high capacities of &gt; 300 mAh g  &#8722;1  at a current density of 100 mA g  &#8722;1  in both RMBs and RCBs, resulting in a high energy density of &gt;300 Wh kg  &#8722;1  for RMBs and &gt;500 Wh kg  &#8722;1  for RCBs. Mechanistic studies reveal the unique redox activity at anionic sulphides moieties and demonstrate fast Mg  2+  ion diffusion kinetics enabled by the soft structure and flexible electron configuration of VS  4  . The concept of coupling a cathode based on anionic redox reactions with a multivalent metal anode provides a general approach towards high performance multivalent batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiple Catalytic C&#8211;H Bond Functionalization for Natural Product Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>In the past decade, multiple catalytic C&#8211;H bond functionalization has been successfully applied in natural product synthesis as a strategy to reduce the number of steps, increase overall yield and employ more easily available starting materials. This minireview presents selected examples making use of multiple C&#8211;H bond functionalization in conceptually different ways. First, linear syntheses are discussed, wherein multiple C&#8211;H functionalization is employed either from simple (hetero)cyclic cores, at a late stage, or to build polycyclic systems. Second, the use of multiple C&#8211;H functionalization as a strategic tool in convergent synthesis to access and couple complex fragments is discussed. Information on the scalability of the employed methods is provided when available. The presented cases indicate that multiple C&#8211;H functionalization strategies should play a great role to shape the future synthesis of functional complex molecules with improved sustainability.</dc:description>

      <title>Tracking Structural Evolution during Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in Quadrupolar Perylene Bisimide with Time&#8208;Resolved Impulsive Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Elucidating structural roles in photoinduced charge transfer is indispensable since nuclear rearrangements are simultaneously involved in the dynamics in most cases. However, it is hard to evaluate whether the structural changes occur or not by using conventional time&#8208;resolved electronic spectroscopies. Here, we apply time&#8208;resolved impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy to record the evolution of vibrational snapshots during charge separation dynamics of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor type quadrupolar perylene bisimide (PBI  1  ) in real&#8208;time. We observed drastic frequency shifts for a large number of Raman bands with their population kinetics. This signifies that symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation accompanies significant structural changes in  1  , which is clearly supported by (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations. Furthermore, a comparison between time&#8208;resolved Raman spectra of the neutral S  1  state and the radical anion species demonstrates that the spectral signatures especially in high frequency regions provide important clues to bond length alternation patterns in the PBI core.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Role of Symmetry in Vibrational Strong Coupling &#8208; The case of Charge Transfer Complexation &#8211;</title>
      <dc:description>It is well known that symmetry plays a key role in chemical reactivity. Here we explore its&#8217; role in vibrational strong coupling (VSC) for a charge transfer (CT) complexation reaction. By studying the trimethylated benzene &#8211; I  2  CT complex, we find first that VSC induces large changes in the equilibrium constant K of the CT complex, reflecting modifications in the &#916;G&#176; of the reaction. Furthermore, by tuning the microfluidic cavity modes to the different IR vibrations of the trimethylated benzene, &#916;G&#176; either increases or decreases depending only on the symmetry of the normal mode that is coupled. This result reveals the critical role of symmetry in VSC and in turn provides an explanation for why the magnitude of chemical changes induced by VSC are much greater than the Rabi splitting, i.e. the energy perturbation caused by VSC. These findings further confirm that VSC is powerful and versatile tool for molecular sciences.</dc:description>

      <title>A low symmetry heterobimetallic [PdPtL4]4+ cage: assembly, guest binding and stimulus&#8208;induced switching</title>
      <dc:description>As part of efforts to enhance the applications of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular architectures (MSAs) there is considerable current interest in the development of lower symmetry heterometallic systems. Herein we report a strategy that enables the quantitative assembly of low symmetry heterobimetallic [PdPtL  4  ]  4+  cage C. We anticipated that the presence of two different metal ions (Pd(II) and Pt(II)) with differing labilities could enable the cage to be &#8220;opened&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; selectively at one end upon treatment with suitable stimuli. Combining an inert platinum(II) tetrapyridylaldehyde complex with a suitably substituted pyridylamine and Pd(II) ions led to the assembly of C.  1  H and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were consistent with the quantitative formation of the cage and the heterobimetallic structure was confirmed using single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cage C was shown to bind quinone guest molecules. The structure of the host&#8208;guest adduct with a 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (G) guest molecule was determined using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Additionally, the system was shown to be stimuli responsive and could be opened and closed on demand. Addition of N,N'&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to the cage C resulted in the formation of the &#8220;open&#8208;cage&#8221; [Pt(L)  4  ]  2+  compound and [Pd(DMAP)  4  ]  2+  complex. This new type of stimulus&#8208;induced cage opening is similar to a flower blossoming/blooming. This process could then be reversed, with the reformation of C, upon the addition of  p  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH). When DMAP was added to the host&#8208;guest adduct, [C&#8834;G]  4+  , the guest was released from C. The host&#8208;guest adduct was subsequently restored upon addition of TsOH.</dc:description>

Origins of OER: The metal geometry in cobalt phosphates was modulated from octahedral to tetrahedral by the simple removal of crystal water in Co3(PO4)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O. The two materials form an ideal platform for the study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) related to the metal coordination structure.







Abstract
The correlation between metal coordination and electrocatalytic water oxidation performance is elusive in many cobalt&#8208;based materials. Herein, we designed an ideal Co phosphate&#8208;based platform to explore the effect of coordination environment on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The cobalt geometry was modulated from octahedral to tetrahedral by simple removal of water ligands in Co3(PO4)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O. Other features except the coordination structure in the two autologous materials remain similar. The two analogues display the same OER kinetics, but the anhydrous Co3(PO4)2 exhibits a greatly enhanced OER activity. On the basis of Raman and operando XAS results, the higher intrinsic activity of the Co tetrahedral sites is because they facilitate the formation of active high valent cobalt (hydr)oxide intermediates during OER. This work not only brings insights of OER on Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts but also provides a reference system to study the effect of metal geometry on electrocatalysis.

      <title>Unusual Skeletal Reorganization of Oxetanes for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dihydroquinolines</title>
      <dc:description>Skeletal reorganization is a type of fascinating transformations owing to their intriguing mechanisms and utility in complex molecule synthesis. However, these reactions are limitedly known for most functional groups. Herein, we describe such an unusual process of oxetanes. In the presence of In(OTf)3 as catalyst, oxetane&#8208;tethered anilines reacted unexpectedly to form 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. This process not only provides expedient access to dihydroquinolines, but also represents a new reaction of oxetane.

      <title>Highly Active Superbulky Alkaline Earth Metal Amide Catalysts for Hydrogenation of Challenging Alkenes and Aromatic Rings</title>
      <dc:description>
Bulk=Hulk: Superbulky alkaline earth metal amide complexes were found to be extremely active catalysts for alkene hydrogenation, clearly extending the substrate scope. Even various arenes, including benzene, can be reduced under relatively mild conditions.







Abstract
Two series of bulky alkaline earth (Ae) metal amide complexes have been prepared: Ae[N(TRIP)2]2 (1&#8208;Ae) and Ae[N(TRIP)(DIPP)]2 (2&#8208;Ae) (Ae=Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; TRIP=SiiPr3, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). While monomeric 1&#8208;Ca was already known, the new complexes have been structurally characterized. Monomers 1&#8208;Ae are highly linear while the monomers 2&#8208;Ae are slightly bent. The bulkier amide complexes 1&#8208;Ae are by far the most active catalysts in alkene hydrogenation with activities increasing from Mg to Ba. Catalyst 1&#8208;Ba can reduce internal alkenes like cyclohexene or 3&#8208;hexene and highly challenging substrates like 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene or tetraphenylethylene. It is also active in arene hydrogenation reducing anthracene and naphthalene (even when substituted with an alkyl) as well as biphenyl. Benzene could be reduced to cyclohexane but full conversion was not reached. The first step in catalytic hydrogenation is formation of an (amide)AeH species, which can form larger aggregates. Increasing the bulk of the amide ligand decreases aggregate size but it is unclear what the true catalyst(s) is (are). DFT calculations suggest that amide bulk also has a noticeable influence on the thermodynamics for formation of the (amide)AeH species. Complex 1&#8208;Ba is currently the most powerful Ae metal hydrogenation catalyst. Due to tremendously increased activities in comparison to those of previously reported catalysts, the substrate scope in hydrogenation catalysis could be extended to challenging multi&#8208;substituted unactivated alkenes and even to arenes among which benzene.

      <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by an Imido Cobalt(III) and the Resulting Amido Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
An abstract concept: A trigonal planar imido cobalt(III) complex, obtained from reaction of a quasi&#8208;linear cobalt(I) complex with an organo azide, is capable of intermolecular H atom abstraction of C&#8722;H bonds. The resulting cobalt(II) amide itself can either deprotonate the substrate, facilitate an H atom abstraction or mediate a stepwise proton/electron transfer. As the latter regenerates the starting cobalt(I) complex, a first catalytic application is presented.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;metal mediated nitrene transfer is under intense scrutiny due to its potential as an atom economic and ecologically benign way for the directed amination of (un)functionalised C&#8722;H bonds. Here we present the isolation and characterisation of a rare, trigonal imido cobalt(III) complex, which bears a rather long cobalt&#8211;imido bond. It can cleanly cleave strong C&#8722;H bonds with a bond dissociation energy of up to 92&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in an intermolecular fashion, unprecedented for imido cobalt complexes. This resulted in the amido cobalt(II) complex [Co(hmds)2(NHtBu)]&#8722;. Kinetic studies on this reaction revealed an H atom transfer mechanism. Remarkably, the cobalt(II) amide itself is capable of mediating H atom abstraction or stepwise proton/electron transfer depending on the substrate. A cobalt&#8208;mediated catalytic application for substrate dehydrogenation using an organo azide is presented.

Safety first: A deep eutectic solvent (DES)&#8208;based self&#8208;healing polymer electrolyte with high safety for lithium metal batteries was fabricated in situ by integrating an UPyMA&#8208;PETEA copolymer matrix with a nonflammable DES+FEC electrolyte (see picture; FEC=fluoroethylene carbonate).

Abstract
The deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries has been greatly impeded by Li dendrite growth and safety concerns originating from flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, we report a stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal battery with a deep eutectic solvent (DES)&#8208;based self&#8208;healing polymer (DSP) electrolyte. This electrolyte was fabricated in a facile manner by in situ copolymerization of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ureido)ethyl methacrylate (UPyMA) and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) monomers in a DES&#8208;based electrolyte containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an additive. The well&#8208;designed DSP electrolyte simultaneously possesses non&#8208;flammability, high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability, and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating. When applied in Li metal batteries with a LiMn2O4 cathode, the DSP electrolyte effectively suppressed manganese dissolution from the cathode and enabled high&#8208;capacity and a long lifespan at room and elevated temperatures.

      <title>Selective Hydrogenation and Hydrodeoxygenation of Aromatic Ketones to Cyclohexane Derivatives Using a Rh@SILP Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of aromatic ketones is achieved using rhodium nanoparticles immobilized on an acid&#8208;free triphenylphosphonium&#8208;based supported ionic liquid phase (Rh@SILP(Ph  3  &#8208;P&#8208;NTf  2  )). The flexible molecular approach used to assemble the individual catalyst components (SiO  2  , ionic liquid, nanoparticles) allows for the formation of a catalytic system possessing outstanding catalytic properties. In particular, an intimate contact between the nanoparticles and the phosphonium ionic liquid is required to enable the deoxygenation reactivity. Using the Rh@SILP(Ph  3  &#8208;P&#8208;NTf  2  ) catalyst, benzylic ketones are hydrodeoxygenated under mild conditions, while for non&#8208;benzylic ketones the product distribution is controlled with high selectivity between the hydrogenated (alcohol) and hydrodeoxygenated (alkane) products by adjusting the reaction temperature. The Rh@SILP(Ph  3  &#8208;P&#8208;NTf  2  ) catalyst possesses excellent activity, versatility and stability, and opens the way to the production of a wide range of high&#8208;value cyclohexane derivatives via the hydrogenation and/or hydrodeoxygenation of Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation products and lignin&#8208;derived aromatic ketones. In addition, the catalyst&#8217;s temperature controlled selectivity is a key feature broadening the scope of accessible products and potential applications.</dc:description>

Using the Rh@SILP(Ph  3  &#8208;P&#8208;NTf  2  ) catalyst, benzylic ketones are hydrodeoxygenated under mild conditions, while for non&#8208;benzylic ketones the product distribution is controlled with high selectivity between the hydrogenated (alcohol) and hydrodeoxygenated (alkane) products by adjusting the reaction temperature. The Rh@SILP(Ph  3  &#8208;P&#8208;NTf  2  ) catalyst possesses excellent activity, versatility and stability, and opens the way to the production of a wide range of high&#8208;value cyclohexane derivatives via the hydrogenation and/or hydrodeoxygenation of Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation products and lignin&#8208;derived aromatic ketones. In addition, the catalyst&#8217;s temperature controlled selectivity is a key feature broadening the scope of accessible products and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>2D sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework for Cooperative Photocatalysis with TEMPO</title>
      <dc:description>
Red, Go! An effective protocol for the selective oxidation of amines into imines was unveiled by cooperative photocatalysis of Por&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and TEMPO illuminated by 623&#8197;nm red LEDs.







Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are receiving ongoing attention in semiconductor photocatalysis. Herein, we present a photocatalytic selective chemical transformation by combining sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) photocatalysis with TEMPO catalysis illuminated by 623&#8197;nm red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Highly selective conversion of amines into imines was swiftly afforded in minutes. Specifically, the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of porphyrin linker leads to extensive absorption of red light; the sp2 &#8722;C=C&#8722; double bonds linkage ensures the stability of Por&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF under high concentrations of amine. Most importantly, we found that crystalline framework of Por&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF is pivotal for cooperative photocatalysis with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO). This work foreshadows that the outstanding hallmarks of COFs, particularly crystallinity, could be exploited to address energy and environmental challenges by cooperative photocatalysis.

      <title>Raman Optical Activity (ROA) as a New Tool to Elucidate the Helical Structure of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
      <dc:description>
Twist and shout: Poly(phenylacetylene)s are helical polymers where the helical sense of the backbone and the pendant groups can differ. It is shown that a correct assignment of both helical senses can be done using Raman optical activity, which gives more structural insight than electronic circular dichroism alone.







Abstract
Poly(phenylacetylene)s are a family of helical polymers constituted by conjugated double bonds. Raman spectra of these polymers show a structural fingerprint of the polyene backbone which, in combination with its helical orientation, makes them good candidates to be studied by Raman optical activity (ROA). Four different well&#8208;known poly(phenylacetylene)s adopting different scaffolds and ten different helical senses have been prepared. Raman and ROA spectra were recorded and allowed to establish ROA&#8208;spectrum/helical&#8208;sense relationships: a left/right&#8208;handed orientation of the polyene backbone (Mhelix/Phelix) produces a triplet of positive/negative ROA bands. Raman and ROA spectra of each polymer exhibited the same profile, and the sign of the ROA spectrum was opposite to the lowest&#8208;energy electronic circular dichroism (ECD) band, indicating a resonance effect. Resonance ROA appears then as an indicator of the helical sense of poly(phenylacetylene)s, especially for those with an extra Cotton band in the ECD spectrum, where a wrong helical sense is assigned based on ECD, while ROA alerts of this misassignment.

      <title>Ultrafast, Low&#8208;Cost, and Mass Production of High&#8208;Quality Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphene synthesis in a flash: Despite more than 15&#8197;years of exploration, the efficient and low&#8208;cost production of graphene, especially high&#8208;quality graphene, remains a great challenge. Very recently, a breakthrough in the synthesis of graphene materials was reported by Tour et&#8197;al. It realized a super&#8208;fast synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene at low cost, showing a great potential for commercialization.







Abstract
Fast, mass, and low&#8208;cost production of high&#8208;quality graphene, which is alluring, remains a great challenge, even though some approaches have shown potential for mass synthesis of graphene. Very recently a great breakthrough was made by Tour and co&#8208;workers (Nature 2020, 577, 647&#8211;651): in just a second, easily exfoliated and highly crystalline graphene was produced from abundant carbon&#8208;containing species by cost&#8208;effective flash Joule heating with a low energy input of 7.2&#8197;kJ per gram graphene. Such an ultrafast, economic, and scalable process for high&#8208;quality graphene production can be considered as a milestone in the graphene field and is highlighted in this article.

      <title>Creation of Al&#8208;Enriched Mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 Nanoboxes with High Catalytic Activity: Converting Tetrahedral Extra&#8208;Framework Al into Framework Sites by Post Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes with low SARs: Rapid ageing of a sol gel synthesis mixture produces a parent zeolite with tetrahedral extra framework Al and a low silicon&#8208;to&#8208;aluminium ratio (SAR) value of &#8776;12, which is transformed to mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes with low SARs of &#8776;16 during post&#8208;synthetic TPAOH treatment. The mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes shows comparatively enhanced mass transfer ability, catalytic cracking activity and longevity.







Abstract
ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanoboxes with accessible meso&#8208;micro&#8208;pore architecture and strong acid sites are important in relevant heterogeneous catalysis suffering from mass transfer limitations and weak acidities. Rational design of parent zeolites with concentrated and non&#8208;protective coordination of Al species can facilitate post&#8208;synthetic treatment to produce mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes. In this work, a simple and effective method was developed to convert parent MFI zeolites with tetrahedral extra&#8208;framework Al into Al&#8208;enriched mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanoboxes with low silicon&#8208;to&#8208;aluminium ratios of &#8776;16. The parent MFI zeolite was prepared by rapid ageing of the zeolite sol gel synthesis mixture. The accessibility to the meso&#8208;micro&#8208;porous intra&#8208;crystalline network was probed systematically by comparative pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion measurements, which, together with the strong acidity of nanoboxes, provided superb catalytic activity and longevity in hydrocarbon cracking for propylene production.

      <title>The Crucial Role of Methodology Development in Directed Evolution of Selective Enzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Take the structure&#8208;guided route: Application of advanced gene mutagenesis methods and strategies ensure speed and reliability in laboratory evolution of selective enzymes as catalysts in organic chemistry and biotechnology. Recent developments in novel methodology from sequence&#8208;based to structure&#8208;guided methods are presented in this review.







Abstract
Directed evolution of stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chemoselective enzymes constitutes a unique way to generate biocatalysts for synthetically interesting transformations in organic chemistry and biotechnology. In order for this protein engineering technique to be efficient, fast, and reliable, and also of relevance to synthetic organic chemistry, methodology development was and still is necessary. Following a description of early key contributions, this review focuses on recent developments. It includes optimization of molecular biological methods for gene mutagenesis and the design of efficient strategies for their application, resulting in notable reduction of the screening effort (bottleneck of directed evolution). When aiming for laboratory evolution of selectivity and activity, second&#8208;generation versions of Combinatorial Active&#8208;Site Saturation Test (CAST) and Iterative Saturation Mutagenesis (ISM), both involving saturation mutagenesis (SM) at sites lining the binding pocket, have emerged as preferred approaches, aided by in silico methods such as machine learning. The recently proposed Focused Rational Iterative Site&#8208;specific Mutagenesis (FRISM) constitutes a fusion of rational design and directed evolution. On&#8208;chip solid&#8208;phase chemical gene synthesis for rapid library construction enhances library quality notably by eliminating undesired amino acid bias, the future of directed evolution?

All&#8208;DNA energy conversion: ZnIIPPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer/electron acceptor nanostructures provide effective scaffolds for mimicking photosynthesis.







Abstract
All&#8208;DNA scaffolds act as templates for the organization of photosystem&#8197;I model systems. A series of DNA templates composed of ZnII&#8208;protoporphyrin IX (ZnIIPPIX)&#8208;functionalized G&#8208;quadruplex conjugated to the 3&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8242;&#8208;end of the tyrosinamide (TA) aptamer and ZnIIPPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex linked to the 3&#8242;&#8208; and 5&#8242;&#8208;ends of the TA aptamer through a four&#8208;thymidine bridge. Effective photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from ZnIIPPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex to bipyridinium&#8208;functionalized tyrosinamide, TA&#8208;MV2+, bound to the TA aptamer units is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the primary ET quenching of ZnIIPPIX/G&#8208;quadruplex by TA&#8208;MV2+ controls the efficiency of the generation of TA&#8208;MV+.. The photosystem&#8208;controlled formation of TA&#8208;MV+. by the different photosystems dictates the secondary activation of the ET cascade corresponding to the ferredoxin&#8208;NADP+ reductase (FNR)&#8208;catalysed reduction of NADP+ to NADPH by TA&#8208;MV+., and the sequestered alcohol dehydrogenase catalysed reduction of acetophenone to 1&#8208;phenylethanol by NADPH.

      <title>Singlet Fission in Carbene&#8208;Derived Diradicaloids</title>
      <dc:description>
Diradicaloids derived from cyclic carbenes are singlet&#8208;fission molecules with exceptionally large diradicaloid character, which self&#8208;assemble at cryogenic temperatures in solution.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new class of singlet fission (SF) materials based on diradicaloids of carbene scaffolds, namely cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs). Our modular approach allows the tuning of two key SF criteria: the steric factor and the diradical character. In turn, we modified the energy landscapes of excited states in a systematic manner to accommodate the needs for SF. We report the first example of intermolecular SF in solution by dimer self&#8208;assembly at cryogenic temperatures.

      <title>Trapping of Difluorocarbene by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
      <dc:description>
Difluorocarbene is reversibly trapped by intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs. The reaction proceeds stepwise via interaction of the carbene with the phosphorus atom followed by formation of the carbon&#8208;boron bond.







Abstract
Frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of diphenylphosphino and boryl groups located at the ortho&#8208;position can trap difluorocarbene affording stable zwitterionic adducts. The reaction can be reversed to release difluorocarbene at elevated temperatures.

Irradiation of silacarboxylic acids with blue LEDs (455 nm) in the presence of a commercially available photo&#8208;catalyst releases silyl radicals, which can further react with various alkenes to give corresponding silylated products in good to high yields with broad functional group compatibility. This reaction proceeds in the presence of water, enabling efficient deuterosilylation of alkenes with D  2  O as the deuterium source. Germyl radicals were similarly obtained.</dc:description>

Easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and robust N&#8208;silyl ketimines are converted to NH&#8208;ketimines in situ, which then react with a Z&#8208;allyl boronate. Transformations are promoted by a readily accessible L&#8208;threonine&#8208;derived aminophenol&#8208;based boryl catalyst, affording the desired products in up to 91% yield, &gt;98:2 a:g selectivity, &gt;98:2 Z:E selectivity, and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio. A commercially available aminophenol may be used, and allyl boronates, which may contain an alkyl&#8208;, a chloro&#8208;, or a bromo&#8208;substituted Z&#8208;alkene, can either be purchased or prepared by catalytic stereoretentive cross&#8208;metathesis.

Various chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselective transformations of the a&#8208;tertiary homoallylic NH2&#8208;amine products highlight the utility of the approach; this includes diastereo&#8208; and regioselective epoxide formation/trichloroacetic acid cleavage to generate differentiated diol derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Ketones as Molecular Co&#8208;catalysts for Boosting Exciton&#8208;Involved Photocatalytic Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Excitonic processes of semiconductors open up the possibility for pursuing photocatalytic organic syntheses. However, the insufficient spin relaxation and robust nonradiative decays in semiconductors place restrictions on both quantum yield and selectivity of these reactions. Herein, by taking polymeric carbon nitride (PCN)/acetone as a prototypical system, we propose that extrinsic aliphatic ketones can serve as molecular co&#8208;catalysts for synergistically promoting spin&#8208;flip transition and suppressing non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Spectroscopic investigations indicate that hot excitons in PCN can be transferred to ketones, while triplet excitons in ketones can be transferred to PCN reversely. As such, PCN/ketone systems exhibit considerable triplet&#8208;exciton accumulation and extended visible&#8208;light response, leading to excellent performance in exciton&#8208;involved photocatalysis like singlet oxygen generation. This work provides a fundamental understanding of energy harvesting in semiconductor/molecule systems, and paves the way for optimizing exciton&#8208;involved photocatalysis via molecular co&#8208;catalyst design.</dc:description>

      <title>A Nanoboat with Fused Concave N&#8208;Heterotriangulene</title>
      <dc:description>
Please don&#8242;t you rock my boat: A highly curved boat&#8208;shaped molecule was synthesized by the cyclization of fjords of a bisacridone derivative. Analysis of the structure and properties reveals a stepwise inversion process, red shifts in the absorption and emission spectra, an enhanced emission intensity and a convergence of frontier molecular orbital energy levels in comparison to those of the related concave N&#8208;heterotriangulene.







Abstract
The surface extension of all&#8208;carbon based bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, such as corannulene and sumanene, to synthesize even larger buckybowls has been widely studied, leaving other concave compounds with heteroatoms less considered. Herein we present a highly curved molecule synthesized via stepwise cyclization of fjords of a bisacridone derivative. Crystallographic analysis unambiguously confirmed a boat&#8208;shaped structure with deformed bottom benzene ring. Theoretical calculation unravels an inversion process with an S&#8208;shaped transition structure rather than a planar one. The enlarged boat demonstrates interesting properties, such as red shifts in absorption and emission spectra, enhanced emission intensity, and convergent frontier molecular orbital energy levels, in comparison to the related concave N&#8208;heterotriangulene.

      <title>Bridged Stilbenes: AIEgens Designed via a Simple Strategy to Control the Non&#8208;radiative Decay Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>
Bridged stilbene: Based on theoretical prediction of non&#8208;radiative decay, a family of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens is reported. Depending on the alkyl chain length, they exhibit different quantum yields. BPST[7] and DPB[7] with excellent AIE behavior are reported.







Abstract
To broaden the application of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens), the design of novel small&#8208;molecular dyes that exhibit high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl) in the solid state is required. Considering that the mechanism of AIE can be rationalized based on steric avoidance of non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, a series of bridged stilbenes was designed, and their non&#8208;radiative decay pathways were investigated theoretically. Bridged stilbenes with short alkyl chains exhibited a strong fluorescence emission in solution and in the solid state, while bridged stilbenes with long alkyl chains exhibited AIE. Based on this theoretical prediction, we developed the bridged stilbenes BPST[7] and DPB[7], which demonstrate excellent AIE behavior.

      <title>Pigmentation chemistry and radical&#8208;based collagen degradation in alkaptonuria and osteoarthritic cartilage</title>
      <dc:description>Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare disease characterized by high levels of homogentisic acid (HGA); patients suffer from tissue ochronosis: dark brown pigmentation, especially of joint cartilage, leading to severe early osteoarthropathy. No molecular mechanism links elevated HGA to ochronosis; the pigment's chemical identity is still not known, nor how it induces joint cartilage degradation. Here we give key insight on HGA&#8208;derived pigment composition and collagen disruption in AKU cartilage. Synthetic pigment and pigmented human cartilage tissue both showed hydroquinone&#8208;resembling NMR signals. EPR spectroscopy showed that the synthetic pigment contains radicals. Moreover, we observed intrastrand disruption of collagen triple helix in pigmented AKU human cartilage, and in cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. We propose that collagen degradation can occur via transient glycyl radicals, the formation of which is enhanced in AKU due to the redox environment generated by pigmentation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare disease characterized by high levels of homogentisic acid (HGA); patients suffer from tissue ochronosis: dark brown pigmentation, especially of joint cartilage, leading to severe early osteoarthropathy. No molecular mechanism links elevated HGA to ochronosis; the pigment's chemical identity is still not known, nor how it induces joint cartilage degradation. Here we give key insight on HGA&#8208;derived pigment composition and collagen disruption in AKU cartilage. Synthetic pigment and pigmented human cartilage tissue both showed hydroquinone&#8208;resembling NMR signals. EPR spectroscopy showed that the synthetic pigment contains radicals. Moreover, we observed intrastrand disruption of collagen triple helix in pigmented AKU human cartilage, and in cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. We propose that collagen degradation can occur via transient glycyl radicals, the formation of which is enhanced in AKU due to the redox environment generated by pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Particle&#8208;Based Amphiphiles as Active Colloids Prepared by Anisotropic Click Chemistry
</title>
      <dc:description>
Particle&#8208;based amphiphiles: Ultra&#8208;small Janus particles (JPs) have been prepared using magnetite/organosilica particles in a click reaction with spatial control. The JPs show a pronounced and reversible magnetic response when applying a weak magnetic field to a dispersion which results in a difference in the interfacial energy.







Abstract
Amphiphiles alter the energy of surfaces, but the extent of this feature is typically constant. Smart systems with amphiphilicity as a function of an external, physical trigger are desirable. As a trigger, the exposure to a magnetic field, in particular, is attractive because it is not shielded in water. Amphiphiles like surfactants are well known, but the magnetic response of molecules is typically weak. Vice&#8208;versa, magnetic particles with strong response to magnetic triggers are fully established in nanoscience, but they are not amphiphilic. In this work colloids with Janus architecture and ultra&#8208;small dimensions (25&#8197;nm) have been prepared by spatial control over the thiol&#8208;yne click modification of organosilica&#8208;magnetite core&#8211;shell nanoparticles. The amphiphilic properties of these anisotropically modified particles are proven. Finally, a pronounced and reversible change in interfacial stabilization results from the application of a weak (&lt;1&#8197;T) magnetic field.

The fleeting existence of [V2O]+ as a reactive intermediate in the oxidation of [V2]+ by CO2 to form [V2O2]+ has been identified; the counter&#8208;intuitive oxidation behavior of [V2]+ versus [V2O]+ and the quite enormous reactivity differences have been traced back to the supportive role of the bridging oxygen atom in [V2O]+.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides onto the surface of gold nanoparticles has emerged as a promising strategy towards the creation of artificial enzymes. The resulting high local peptide density surrounding the nanoparticle leads to cooperative and synergistic effects, which result in rate accelerations and distinct catalytic properties compared to the unconjugated peptide. This Minireview summarizes contributions to and progress made in the field of catalytically active peptide&#8211;gold nanoparticle conjugates. The origin of distinct properties, as well as potential applications, are also discussed.

      <title>Phosphorescence Energy Transfer: Ambient Afterglow Fluorescence from Water&#8208;Processable and Purely Organic Dyes via Delayed Sensitization</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphorescence energy transfer from long&#8208;lived organic phosphors (donors) is introduced as a novel design strategy for realizing afterglow fluorescence from commercially available organic dyes (acceptors) under ambient conditions. This triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer leads to ambient red afterglow in water&#8208;processable and flexible films via a delayed sensitization process of the acceptor singlet state.







Abstract
Ambient afterglow luminescence from metal&#8208;free organic chromophores would provide a promising alternative to the well&#8208;explored inorganic phosphors. However, the realization of air&#8208;stable and solution&#8208;processable organic afterglow systems with long&#8208;lived triplet or singlet states remains a formidable challenge. In the present study, a delayed sensitization of the singlet state of organic dyes via phosphorescence energy transfer from organic phosphors is proposed as an alternative strategy to realize &#8220;afterglow fluorescence&#8221;. This concept is demonstrated with a long&#8208;lived phosphor as the energy donor and commercially available fluorescent dyes as the energy acceptor. Triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy&#8208;transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) between donor and acceptor chromophores, which are co&#8208;organized in an amorphous polymer matrix, results in tuneable yellow and red afterglow from the fluorescent acceptors. Moreover, these afterglow fluorescent hybrids are highly solution&#8208;processable and show excellent air&#8208;stability with good quantum yields.

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalysts on Overhang&#8208;Eave Carbon Cages for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
An overhang&#8208;eave carbon cage decorated with single&#8208;atom iron catalysts for oxygen reduction (ORR) is prepared. This structure could furnish more stretched edges as three&#8208;phase boundaries to support the mass transport of ORR&#8208;relevant species and to expose the atomically dispersed/catalytically active iron sites to the utmost, thus increasing the utilization of each active site.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have drawn great attention, especially in electrocatalysis. However, most of previous works focus on the enhanced catalytic properties via improving metal loading. Engineering morphologies of catalysts to facilitate mass transport through catalyst layers, thus increasing the utilization of each active site, is regarded as an appealing way for enhanced performance. Herein, we design an overhang&#8208;eave structure decorated with isolated single&#8208;atom iron sites via a silica&#8208;mediated MOF&#8208;templated approach for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. This catalyst demonstrates superior ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst and superior to most precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts reported to date. This activity originates from its edge&#8208;rich structure, having more three&#8208;phase boundaries with enhanced mass transport of reactants to accessible single&#8208;atom iron sites (increasing the utilization of active sites), which verifies the practicability of such a synthetic approach.

      <title>Modular Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Terpenes and their Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
A short enzymatic synthesis is established to generate terpene natural products and key intermediates directly from inexpensive prenols. This approach allows the incorporation of additional alkyl&#8208; or hydroxyl&#8208;groups at positions of interest and is applied in the synthesis of high&#8208;value semiochemicals and medicinal chemistry intermediates.







Abstract
Non&#8208;natural terpenoids offer potential as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, their chemical syntheses are often long, complex, and not easily amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we report a modular chemoenzymatic approach to synthesize terpene analogues from diphosphorylated precursors produced in quantitative yields. Through the addition of prenyl transferases, farnesyl diphosphates, (2E,6E)&#8208;FDP and (2Z,6Z)&#8208;FDP, were isolated in greater than 80&#8201;% yields. The synthesis of 14,15&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;FDP, 12&#8208;methyl&#8208;FDP, 12&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;FDP, homo&#8208;FDP, and 15&#8208;methyl&#8208;FDP was also achieved. These modified diphosphates were used with terpene synthases to produce the unnatural sesquiterpenoid semiochemicals (S)&#8208;14,15&#8208;dimethylgermacrene&#8197;D and (S)&#8208;12&#8208;methylgermacrene D as well as dihydroartemisinic aldehyde. This approach is applicable to the synthesis of many non&#8208;natural terpenoids, offering a scalable route free from repeated chain extensions and capricious chemical phosphorylation reactions.

      <title>Sodium Dithionite&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Sulfonylation: Facile Access to Tertiary Sulfones</title>
      <dc:description>
Piece of cake: A straightforward multicomponent decarboxylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;active esters, sodium dithionite and electrophiles was established to construct sterically bulky sulfones. The inorganic salt sodium dithionite not only served as the sulfur dioxide source, but also acted as an efficient radical initiator for the decarboxylation.







Abstract
A straightforward multicomponent decarboxylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;active esters (N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester), sodium dithionite, and electrophiles was established to construct sterically bulky sulfones. The inorganic salt sodium dithionite not only served as the sulfur dioxide source, but also acted as an efficient radical initiator for the decarboxylation. Notably, diverse naturally abundant carboxylic acids and artificially prepared carboxyl&#8208;containing drugs with multiple heteroatoms and sensitive functional groups successfully underwent this decarboxylative sulfonylation to provide sterically bulky tertiary sulfones. Mechanistic studies further demonstrated that decarboxylation was the rate&#8208;determining step and occurred via a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process with the assistance of sodium dithionite.

      <title>Elucidating Noncovalent Reaction Mechanisms: G&#8208;Quartet as an Intermediate in G&#8208;Quadruplex Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
G4 on the floor: The unprecedented K+ G&#8208;quartet has been detected as a transient intermediate along the course of G&#8208;quadruplex self&#8208;assembly following an approach that is reminiscent of classical covalent mechanistic studies.







Abstract
In analogy to covalent reactions, the understanding of noncovalent association pathways is fundamental to influence and control any supramolecular process.

      <title>Exploring the Limits of Transition&#8208;Metal Fluorination at High Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>
What is the limit? High pressure is predicted to allow for the synthesis of several new transition&#8208;metal fluorides. Record&#8208;high formal oxidation states of +8 can be reached in octafluorides of osmium and iridium below 300&#8197;GPa. The stabilization of OsF8 and IrF8 by pressure is explained by valence expansions, where 6p orbitals are lowered in energy and allow for ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal F&#8197;2p&#8594;M&#8197;6p charge transfer.







Abstract
Fluorination is a proven method for challenging the limits of chemistry, both structurally and electronically. Here we explore computationally how pressures below 300&#8197;GPa affect the fluorination of several transition metals. A plethora of new structural phases are predicted along with the possibility for synthesizing four unobserved compounds: TcF7, CdF3, OsF8, and IrF8. The Ir and Os octaflourides are both predicted to be stable as quasi&#8208;molecular phases with an unusual cubic ligand coordination, and both compounds formally correspond to a high oxidation state of +8. Electronic&#8208;structure analysis reveals that otherwise unoccupied 6p levels are brought down in energy by the combined effects of pressure and a strong ligand field. The valence expansion of Os and Ir enables ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal F&#8197;2p&#8594;M&#8197;6p charge transfer that strengthens M&#8722;F bonds and decreases the overall bond polarity. The lower stability of IrF8, and the instability of PtF8 and several other compounds below 300&#8197;GPa, is explained by the occupation of M&#8722;F antibonding orbitals in octafluorides with a metal&#8208;valence&#8208;electron count exceeding 8.

      <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembled Photo&#8208;Responsive Tubisomes from a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Bridged Amphiphilic Block Copolymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of a cyclic peptide functional amphiphilic diblock copolymer into photo&#8208;responsive tubisomes in water was investigated. These tubisomes are employed as photo&#8208;controlled drug delivery vehicles for anticancer drug Doxorubicin to achieve enhanced intracellular DOX release and improved anticancer activity.







Abstract
Typically, the morphologies of the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures from block copolymers are limited to spherical micelles, wormlike micelles and vesicles. Now, a new generation of materials with unique shape and structures, cylindrical soft matter particles (tubisomes), are obtained from the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of cyclic peptide&#8208;bridged amphiphilic diblock copolymers. The capacity of obtained photo&#8208;responsive tubisomes as potential drug carriers is evaluated. The supramolecular tubisomes pave an alternative way for fabricating polymeric tubular structures, and will expand the toolbox for the rational design of functional hierarchical nanostructures.

      <title>Trishomoaromatic (B3N3Ph6) Dianion: Characterization and Two&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Mix it up: The two&#8208;electron reduction of borazine (B3N3Ph6) is achieved for the first time to yield the stable (B3N3Ph6)2&#8722;, which exhibits a C3v&#8208;symmetric parallel double&#8208;layer structure and (&#960;,&#963;)&#8208;mixed homoaromaticity. (B3N3Ph6)2&#8722; can act as a robust 2e reductant for anthracene, chalcone, and tanshinones with high efficiency and selectivity under mild reaction conditions, and regenerates B3N3Ph6.







Abstract
Benzene, a common aromatic compound, can be converted into an unstable antiaromatic 8&#960;&#8208;electron intermediate through two&#8208;electron reduction. However, as an isoelectronic equivalent of benzene, borazine (B3N3Ph6), having weak aromaticity, undergoes a totally different two&#8208;electron reduction to afford (B3N3R6)2&#8722; homoaromatic compounds. Reported here is the synthesis of homoaromatic (B3N3Ph6)2&#8722; by the reduction of B3N3Ph6 with either potassium or rubidium in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. Theoretical investigations illustrate that two electrons delocalize over the three boron atoms in (B3N3Ph6)2&#8722;, which is formed by the geometric and orbital reorganization and exhibits (&#960;,&#963;)&#8208;mixed homoaromaticity. Moreover, (B3N3Ph6)2&#8722; can act as a robust 2e reductant for unsaturated compounds, such as anthracene, chalcone, and tanshinones. This 2e reduction is of high efficiency and selectivity, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and can regenerate neutral borazine.

      <title>Porous Tantalum Nitride Single Crystal at Two&#8208;Centimeter Scale with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous single crystals combine both porosity and structural coherence and therefore demonstrate enhanced photoelectrochemical functionalities. Here porous Ta3N5 single crystal at two&#8208;centimeter scale are grown and used for the photoelectrochemical oxidation of alcohols with the (002) facet showing &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity to aldehydes/ketones.







Abstract
Porous tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) single crystals, combining structural coherence and porous microstructure, would substantially improve the photoelectrochemical performance. The structural coherence would reduce the recombination of charge carriers and maintain excellent transport properties while the porous microstructure would not only reduce photon scattering but also facilitate surface reactions. Here, we grow bulk&#8208;porous Ta3N5 single crystals on a two&#8208;centimeter scale with (002), (023), and (041) facets, respectively, and show significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical performance. We show the preferential facet growth of porous crystals in a lattice reconstruction strategy in relation to lattice match and lattice channel. We present the facet engineering to enhance light absorption, exciton lifetime and transport properties. The porous Ta3N5 single crystal boosts photoelectrochemical oxidation of alcohols with the (002) facet showing the highest performance of &gt;99&#8201;% alcohol conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% aldehyde/ketone selectivity.

      <title>Spatial Manipulation and Integration of Supramolecular Filaments on Hydrogel Substrates towards Advanced Soft Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Two kinds of soft devices have been fabricated through spatial manipulation and integration of micellar filaments on the surface of hydrogels. They include a freely suspended fibrous net that can trap and release micro&#8208;particles and the one that is capable of morphing shapes with controlled rolling directionality.







Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies are promising building blocks for the fabrication of functional soft devices for high&#8208;tech applications. However, there is a lack of effective methods for large&#8208;scale manipulation and integration of nano&#8208;sized supramolecular structures on soft substrate. Now, functional soft devices composed of micellar filaments and hydrogels can be created through a versatile approach involving guided dewetting, transfer&#8208;printing, and laser&#8208;assisted patterning. Such an approach enables unprecedented control over the location and alignment of the micellar filaments on hydrogel substrates. As examples, freely suspended micellar fishnets immobilized on hydrogels are formed, showing the capability of trapping and releasing micro&#8208;objects and the piconewton force sensitivity. By incorporating responsive moieties into hydrogels, shape&#8208;morphing actuators with micelle&#8208;controlled rolling directionality are constructed.

     alt="Spatial Manipulation and Integration of Supramolecular Filaments on Hydrogel Substrates towards Advanced Soft Devices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two kinds of soft devices&lt;/b&gt; have been fabricated through spatial manipulation and integration of micellar filaments on the surface of hydrogels. They include a freely suspended fibrous net that can trap and release micro&#8208;particles and the one that is capable of morphing shapes with controlled rolling directionality.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular assemblies are promising building blocks for the fabrication of functional soft devices for high&#8208;tech applications. However, there is a lack of effective methods for large&#8208;scale manipulation and integration of nano&#8208;sized supramolecular structures on soft substrate. Now, functional soft devices composed of micellar filaments and hydrogels can be created through a versatile approach involving guided dewetting, transfer&#8208;printing, and laser&#8208;assisted patterning. Such an approach enables unprecedented control over the location and alignment of the micellar filaments on hydrogel substrates. As examples, freely suspended micellar fishnets immobilized on hydrogels are formed, showing the capability of trapping and releasing micro&#8208;objects and the piconewton force sensitivity. By incorporating responsive moieties into hydrogels, shape&#8208;morphing actuators with micelle&#8208;controlled rolling directionality are constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Donor&#8208;Flexible Bis(pyridylidene amide) Ligands for Highly Efficient Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Unstoppable: A ruthenium complex with a donor&#8208;flexible bis(pyridylidene amide) (PYA) ligand catalyzed Lemieux&#8208;type olefin oxidation at ppm&#8208;level catalyst loadings with exceptionally high turnover frequencies (see picture). The ability of the PYA ligand to switch donor properties facilitates redox changes of the ruthenium center.







Abstract
An exceptionally efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been designed by exploiting N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridylidene)oxalamide (bisPYA) as a donor&#8208;flexible ligand. The dynamic donor ability of the bisPYA ligand, imparted by variable zwitterionic and neutral resonance structure contributions, paired with the redox activity of ruthenium provided catalytic activity for Lemieux&#8211;Johnson&#8208;type oxidative cleavage of olefins to efficiently prepare ketones and aldehydes. The ruthenium bisPYA complex significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems and displays extraordinary catalytic activity in this oxidation, reaching turnover frequencies of 650&#8201;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 and turnover numbers of several millions.

      <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of NBN&#8208;Doped Zigzag&#8208;Edged Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <dc:description>
Close to the edge: Two novel NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are derived through surface&#8208;assisted synthesis. Experiments and calculations reveal the importance of the NBN units in modulating the electronic structures of the ZGNRs. Moreover, theoretical calculations predict that the electronic structures of NBN&#8208;ZGNRs can be further tailored through one&#8208;electron oxidation of each NBN unit into the corresponding radical cations.







Abstract
We report the first bottom&#8208;up synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged GNRs (NBN&#8208;ZGNR1 and NBN&#8208;ZGNR2) through surface&#8208;assisted polymerization and cyclodehydrogenation based on two U&#8208;shaped molecular precursors with an NBN unit preinstalled at the zigzag edge. The resultant zigzag&#8208;edge topologies of GNRs are elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electronic structures of NBN&#8208;ZGNR1 and NBN&#8208;ZGNR2 are significantly different from those of their corresponding pristine fully&#8208;carbon&#8208;based ZGNRs. Additionally, DFT calculations predict that the electronic structures of NBN&#8208;ZGNRs can be further tailored to be gapless and metallic through one&#8208;electron oxidation of each NBN unit into the corresponding radical cations. This work reported herein provides a feasible strategy for the synthesis of GNRs with stable zigzag edges yet tunable electronic properties.

      <dc:description>
A highly efficient and selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;relay migratory hydroarylation process was reported. This mild process was proposed to proceed through non&#8208;dissociative chain&#8208;walking of aryl&#8208;nickel(II)&#8208;hydride along the hydrocarbon chain of alkenes.







Abstract
A redox&#8208;relay migratory hydroarylation of isomeric mixtures of olefins with arylboronic acids catalyzed by nickel complexes bearing diamine ligands is described. A range of structurally diverse 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, including those containing a 1,1&#8208;diarylated quaternary carbon, were obtained in excellent yields and with high regioselectivity. Preliminary experimental evidence supports the proposed non&#8208;dissociated chainwalking of aryl&#8208;nickel(II)&#8208;hydride species along the alkyl chain of alkenes before selective reductive elimination at a benzylic position. A catalyst loading as low as 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% proved to be sufficient in large&#8208;scale synthesis while retaining high reactivity, highlighting the practical value of this transformation.

Halogen bonding is by now established in noncovalent organocatalysis, but enantioselective applications are still very rare. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201915931) S.&#8197;M.

      <title>An Activatable Polymeric Reporter for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Imaging of Invasive Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable polymeric reporter (P&#8208;Dex) is designed to turn on near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to a biomarker (uPA) for in&#8197;vivo imaging of invasive breast cancers, as reported by Q.&#8197;Miao, K.&#8197;Pu, et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000035). P&#8208;Dex not only has a high sensitivity and specificity towards the cancer biomarker but also undergoes renal clearance in living mice.

      <title>&#8220;Armor&#8208;Plating&#8221; Enzymes with Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
      <dc:description>
Armorous advances: Embedding enzyme within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exoskeleton improves the stability and life&#8208;time of enzymes. This Minireview shows the progress made with MOFs&#8208;embedded enzymes. It focuses on new embedding strategies for constructing enzyme@MOF biocomposites and the factors that influence the change in enzymatic activity. In addition, applications of enzyme@MOFs in fields such as biocatalysis, sensing, and nanocatalysis therapeutics, are presented.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;free enzymatic catalysis (CFEC) is an emerging biotechnology that enable the biological transformations in complex natural networks to be imitated. This biomimetic approach allows industrial products such as biofuels and biochemical to be manufactured in a green manner. Nevertheless, the main challenge in CFEC is the poor stability, which restricts the effectiveness and lifetime of enzymes in sophisticated applications. Immobilization of the enzymes within solid carriers is considered an efficient strategy for addressing these obstacles. Specifically, putting an &#8220;armor&#8208;like&#8221; porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) exoskeleton tightly around the enzymes not only shields the enzymes against external stimulus, but also allows the selective transport of guests through the accessible porous network. Herein we present the concept of this biotechnology of MOF&#8208;entrapped enzymes and its cutting&#8208;edge applications.

      <dc:description>
Mn2+ doping into perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) leads to the formation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R.P.) defects and thus induces quantum confinement within the host NCs, as shown by T. Debnath, L. Polavarapu, et al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.2011914473). At the R.P. defect planes, the octahedral layers of the interface are translated by exactly half a unit cell and the carriers are confined to the individual domains separated by R.P. defect planes.

      <title>Chiral carbon dots mimicking topoisomerase I to enantioselectively mediate topological rearrangement of supercoiled DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities represent promising alternatives to natural enzymes, while mimicking enzymatic enantioselectivity is still in nascent stage and remains great challenge. Herein, we report a new finding that cysteine&#8208;derived chiral carbon dots (CDs) can mimic topoisomerase I to enantioselectively mediate topological rearrangement of supercoiled DNA. D&#8208;CDs can more effectively catalyze the topological transition of plasmid DNA from supercoiled to nicked open&#8208;circular configuration than L&#8208;CDs. A series of experimental evidences indicate the underlying mechanism: D&#8208;CDs can intercalatively bind with DNA double helix more strongly than L&#8208;CDs; and moreover, the intercalative CDs can catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals to cleave phosphate backbone in one strand of the double helix, leading to topological rearrangement of supercoiled DNA. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reveals that stronger affinity participated by hydrogen bonding formation and hydrophobic interaction between D&#8208;cysteine and DNA than that of L&#8208;cysteine is the origin of enantioselectivity. Unexpectedly, CDs treated plasmid DNA with nicked open&#8208;circular configuration maintains the genetic activity in cell&#8208;free system which involves coupled gene transcription and translation. The gene expression of CDs treated plasmid DNA is enhanced compared with untreated plasmid DNA, which is analogous to the regulation effect of topoisomerase I on gene expression. Our work demonstrates the enzymatic enantioselectivity of chiral carbon dots, and the topoisomerase I mimicking activity will enable important and promising applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Converged Valence Bands and Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity for High&#8208;Performance SnTe Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>SnTe, an analogue of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for thermoelectric energy conversion. However, large energy gap (&#916;Ev) between the light and heavy hole valence bands, intrinsic Sn&#8208;vacancies and high thermal conductivity result in inferior thermoelectric performance in pristine SnTe. Here, we have demonstrated a two&#8208;step optimization strategy to improve the thermoelectric performance of SnTe via modulating the electronic structure and phonon transport. We have first optimized the electrical transport of self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te) via Ag doping, which resulted in an optimized carrier concentration. Further, Mn doping in Sn1.03&#8208;xAgxTe resulted in highly converged valence bands, which improved the Seebeck coefficient markedly. &#916;Ev decreases to 0.10 eV in Sn0.83Ag0.03Mn0.17Te compared to the value of 0.35 eV in pristine SnTe. As a result of optimized carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands, we obtained a high power factor ~24.8 mW/cmK2 at 816 K in Sn0.83Ag0.03Mn0.17Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.83Ag0.03Mn0.17Te reached to an ultralow value ~0.3 W/mK at 865 K, which is one of lowest values reported so far in SnTe&#8208;based crystalline thermoelectrics, due to the formation of Ag7Te4 nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. As a result of the synergy among optimized carrier concentration, valence band convergence and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained a high thermoelectric figure of merit, zT ~1.45 at 865 K in Sn0.83Ag0.03Mn0.17Te.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleophilic Attack of Azide at Electrophilic Azides: Formation of N6 Units in Hexazene and Aminopentazole Derivatives.</title>
      <dc:description>With the help of selective  15  N labeling experiments, it has been confirmed that nucleophilic attack of azide at iminium&#8208;activated organic azides leads to short&#8208;lived hexazene intermediates. Such species do not only tend to a cleavage reaction with formation of N&#8208;azido compounds, but also undergo ring closure to generate unprecedented amidino&#8208;functionalized pentazoles.

      <dc:description>The development of a turn&#8208;on lanthanide luminescent probe for time&#8208;gated detection of nitroreductases (NTRs) in live bacteria is reported. The probe is activated through NTR&#8208;induced formation of the sensitizing carbostyril antenna and resulting energy transfer to the lanthanide center. This novel NTR&#8208;responsive trigger is virtually non&#8208;fluorescent in its inactivated form and features a large signal increase upon activation. We show that the probe is capable of selectively sensing NTR in lysates as well as in live bacteria comprising clinically highly relevant multiresistant pathogens of the ESKAPE family responsible for the majority of hospital infections. The results suggest that our probe could be used to develop diagnostic tools for bacterial infections.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The degree by which metalloproteins partially regulate net charge (  Z  ) upon electron transfer (ET) was recently measured for the first time using &#8220;protein charge ladders&#8221; of azurin, cytochrome c, and myoglobin [  Angew.

Here, we report a strategy to functionalize inorganic nanoparticles with intrinsically disordered protein domains associated with the formation of membraneless compartments in cells. These protein sequences, defined as low complexity domains (LCDs), encode intermolecular interactions that drive highly controlled, dynamic self&#8208;assembly in response to environmental changes. We demonstrate that the properties of the LCDs can be transferred to inorganic nanoparticles, inducing controlled phase separation that exhibits dynamicity and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness to ionic strength and pH.

      <title>Selective Enzymatic Oxidation of Silanes to Silanols</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to the biological world&#8217;s rich chemistry for functionalizing carbon, enzymatic transformations of the heavier homologue silicon are rare. We report that a wild&#8208;type cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450  BM3&#160;  from&#160;  Bacillus megaterium,&#160;  CYP102A1)  &#160;  has promiscuous activity for oxidation of hydrosilanes to make silanols. Directed evolution enhanced this non&#8208;native activity and created a highly efficient catalyst for selective silane oxidation under mild conditions with oxygen as terminal oxidant. The evolved enzyme leaves C &#8211; H bonds present in the silane substrates untouched, and this biotransformation does not lead to disiloxane formation, a common problem in silanol syntheses. Computational studies reveal that catalysis proceeds through hydrogen atom abstraction followed by radical rebound, as observed in the P450&#8217;s native C&#8211;H hydroxylation mechanism. Enzymatic silane oxidation now extends Nature&#8217;s impressive catalytic repertoire.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compared to the biological world&#8217;s rich chemistry for functionalizing carbon, enzymatic transformations of the heavier homologue silicon are rare. We report that a wild&#8208;type cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450  BM3&#160;  from&#160;  Bacillus megaterium,&#160;  CYP102A1)  &#160;  has promiscuous activity for oxidation of hydrosilanes to make silanols. Directed evolution enhanced this non&#8208;native activity and created a highly efficient catalyst for selective silane oxidation under mild conditions with oxygen as terminal oxidant. The evolved enzyme leaves C &#8211; H bonds present in the silane substrates untouched, and this biotransformation does not lead to disiloxane formation, a common problem in silanol syntheses. Computational studies reveal that catalysis proceeds through hydrogen atom abstraction followed by radical rebound, as observed in the P450&#8217;s native C&#8211;H hydroxylation mechanism. Enzymatic silane oxidation now extends Nature&#8217;s impressive catalytic repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Binary (Split) Light&#8208;up Aptameric Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>This review discusses the design and applications of binary (also known as split) light&#8208;up aptameric sensors (BLAS). BLAS consist of two RNA or DNA strands and an fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associate, the two strands form a dye&#8208;binding site, followed by increase in fluorescence of the aptamer&#8208;bound dye. The design is cost&#8208;efficient since it uses short oligonucleotides and does not require conjugation of organic dyes with nucleic acids. In some applications, BLAS design is preferable over monolith sensors due to simpler assay optimization and improved selectivity. RNA&#8208;based BLAS can be expressed in cells and used for intracellular monitoring of biological molecules. BLAS have been used as reporters of nucleic acid association events in RNA nanotechnology and nucleic acid&#8208;based molecular computation. Other applications of BLAS include detection of nucleic acids, proteins and cancer cells, and potentially they can be tailored to report a broad range of biological analytes in a cost&#8208;efficient, highly selective and easy&#8208;to&#8208;optimize format. This review summarizes the state of the art in BLAS development and outlines perspectives and applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Consecutive Charging of a Perylene Bisimide Dye by Multistep Low Energy Solar Light&#8208;induced Electron Transfer Towards H2 Evolution</title>

      <title>Molecular Engineering for Metal&#8208;Free Amorphous Materials with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
All aglow: Amorphous metal&#8208;free materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence display unique photophysical properties and present promising applications. This Minireview summarizes recent progress and gives insightful perspectives in this rapidly developing field, which will be beneficial to the future development of luminescent materials.







Abstract
Materials displaying room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have been attracting wide attention in recent years due to their distinctive characteristics including long emissive lifetime and large Stokes shift, and their various applications. Most synthesized RTP materials are metal complexes that display enhanced intersystem crossing and crystallization is a common way to restrict nonradiative transition. Amorphous metal&#8208;free RTP materials, which do not rely on expensive and toxic metals and can be prepared in a straightforward fashion, have become an important branch of the field. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in amorphous RTP materials according to the approaches used to immobilize phosphors: host&#8211;guest interactions, molecule doping, copolymers, and small&#8208;molecule self&#8208;assembly. Some existing challenges and insightful perspectives are given at the end of the Minireview, which should benefit the future design and development of amorphous metal&#8208;free RTP materials.

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis and Application of Chiral Spirosilabiindanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Designer scaffolds: Reported here is the rational design, asymmetric synthesis, and application of chiral spirosilabiindane scaffolds. Highly enantioselective synthesis of spirosilabiindanes is demonstrated for the first time by using a Rh&#8208;catalyzed double hydrosilation. The versatility of this new chiral scaffold was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of SPSiOL, and application of its phosphoramidite derivatives as ligands in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Reported here is the development of a class of chiral spirosilabiindane scaffolds by Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydrosilation, for the first time. Enantiopure SPSiOL (spirosilabiindane diol), a new type of chiral building block for the preparation of various chiral ligands and catalysts, was readily prepared on greater than 10 gram scale using this protocol. The potential of this new spirosilabiindane scaffold in asymmetric catalysis was preliminarily demonstrated by development of the corresponding monodentate phosphoramidite ligands (SPSiPhos), which were used in both a Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation and a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular carboamination.

      <title>High&#8208;Throughput Proteomics Enabled by a Photocleavable Surfactant</title>
      <dc:description>
Photocleavable Surfactant: The unique ability of 4&#8208;hexylphenylazosulfonate (Azo) to serve as an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; MS&#8208;compatible surfactant for both high&#8208;throughput bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down proteomics is demonstrated.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based proteomics provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding the structure and function of proteins in complex biological systems; however, protein solubility and sample preparation before MS remain a bottleneck preventing high&#8208;throughput proteomics. Herein, we report a high&#8208;throughput bottom&#8208;up proteomic method enabled by a newly developed MS&#8208;compatible photocleavable surfactant, 4&#8208;hexylphenylazosulfonate (Azo) that facilitates robust protein extraction, rapid enzymatic digestion (30&#8197;min compared to overnight), and subsequent MS&#8208;analysis following UV degradation. Moreover, we developed an Azo&#8208;aided bottom&#8208;up method for analysis of integral membrane proteins, which are key drug targets and are generally underrepresented in global proteomic studies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of Azo to serve as an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; MS&#8208;compatible surfactant for both top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up proteomics, with streamlined workflows for high&#8208;throughput proteomics amenable to clinical applications.

Water, water everywhere: In&#8197;situ polymerization is used to prepare thermo&#8208;responsive PNIPAM@MIL&#8208;101(Cr) composites with up to 440&#8197;wt&#8201;% of water uptake capacity from humid air at 96&#8201;% RH and 25&#8201;&#176;C.

Abstract
We report an in&#8197;situ polymerization strategy to incorporate a thermo&#8208;responsive polymer, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), with controlled loadings into the cavity of a mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MIL&#8208;101(Cr). The resulting MOF/polymer composites exhibit an unprecedented temperature&#8208;triggered water capture and release behavior originating from the thermo&#8208;responsive phase transition of the PNIPAM component. This result sheds light on the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous adsorbent materials for water capture and heat transfer applications under relatively mild operating conditions.

      <title>Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Tertiary Bromides by Pentanidium&#8208;Catalyzed Phase&#8208;Transfer Azidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Now resolved: Under base&#8208;free conditions, enantiomerically enriched azides and bromides were obtained through the pentanidium&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic tertiary bromides (see scheme). Furthermore, new experimental observations and DFT modeling of the reaction pathways enabled better understanding of the contrasting enantioconvergent azidation of tertiary bromides, thus establishing it as a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR).







Abstract
We have developed a method to afford enantiomerically enriched tertiary azides and bromides through pentanidium&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic tertiary bromides under base&#8208;free conditions. We found that the absence of water is crucial to attain a high selectivity factor (s). On the other hand, new experimental observations and DFT modeling led us to propose that enantioconvergent azidation of tertiary bromides proceeded through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). The investigations particularly identified the crucial roles of base and water in the enantioconvergent process, thus supporting the proposal that the tertiary bromide isomerizes in the presence of base and water through a SN2X pathway.

      <title>Divergent, Stereospecific Mono&#8208; and Difluoromethylation of Boronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluoro divergence: Upon homologation of a boronic ester with fluoroiodomethyllithium, the intermediate &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;boronic ester can be converted into &#8208;CH2F (protodeboronation) or &#8208;CHF2 (fluorodeboronation). The choice of the fluorocarbenoid was key, requiring a substituent that was both a good leaving group and poor at stabilizing a carbene. By exploiting the stereospecificity of the 1,2&#8208;migration, this approach enables complete control of asymmetry.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in incorporating fluorine into agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals to improve their biological properties. Whilst a number of methods have been reported for installing CH2F and CHF2 groups, they are mainly limited to radical reactions, which are invariably racemic. Herein, we report the divergent, stereospecific reaction of fluoroiodomethyllithium with boronic esters to give &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;boronic esters. These unique intermediates can be readily transformed into the corresponding mono&#8208; or difluoromethylated compounds through proto&#8208; or fluorodeboronation, respectively. The use of the highly unstable fluoroiodomethyllithium was key to allowing rapid 1,2&#8208;migration over competing decomposition of the carbanion. DFT calculations informed and supported the experimental findings.

Alkenyl boronic acids have been successfully employed for the first time in Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation. A wide array of &#946;&#8208;alkenylated amide products can be obtained in moderate to good yields, which offers practical access to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams.

      <title>Three&#8208;Pronged Attack by Homologous Far&#8208;red/NIR AIEgens to Achieve 1+1+1&gt;3 Synergistic Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Power of three: A synergistic enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) strategy was developed that concurrently acts on multiple subcellular organelles. At the same photosensitizer concentration, combined PDT treatment with three aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) exhibits superior therapeutic effect than that of single AIEgens.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has long been shown to be a powerful therapeutic modality for cancer. However, PDT is undiversified and has become stereotyped in recent years. Exploration of distinctive PDT methods is thus highly in demand but remains a severe challenge. Herein, an unprecedented 1+1+1&gt;3 synergistic strategy is proposed and validated for the first time. Three homologous luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were rationally designed based on a simple backbone. Through slight structural tuning, these far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared AIE luminogens are capable of specifically anchoring to mitochondria, cell membrane, and lysosome, and effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, biological studies demonstrated combined usage of three AIE photosensitizers gives multiple ROS sources simultaneously derived from several organelles, which gives superior therapeutic effect than that from a single organelle at the same photosensitizers concentration. This strategy is conceptually and operationally simple, providing an innovative approach and renewed awareness of improving therapeutic effect through three&#8208;pronged PDT.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission from Tin&#8211;Lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) Alloyed Perovskite Quantum Dots by Sodium Doping</title>
      <dc:description>
Na Na Na: Sodium doping enables near&#8208;infrared emission from Pb/Sn&#8208;based perovskite nanocrystals for the first time. The doping potentially stabilizes Sn2+ and I&#8722; ions by strengthening their chemical bonds which thus suppresses the formation of trapping states.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;stable CsSnxPb1&#8722;xI3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise for optoelectronic applications owing to their strong response in the near&#8208;infrared region. Unfortunately, optimal utilization of their potential is limited by the severe photoluminescence (PL) quenching, leading to extremely low quantum yields (QYs) of approximately 0.3&#8201;%. The ultra&#8208;low sodium (Na) doping presented herein is found to be effective in improving PL QYs of these alloyed QDs without alerting their favourable electronic structure. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies suggest the formation of a stronger chemical interaction between I&#8722; and Sn2+ ions upon Na doping, which potentially helps to stabilize Sn2+ and suppresses the formation of I&#8197;vacancy defects. The optimized PL QY of the Na&#8208;doped QDs reaches up to around 28&#8201;%, almost two orders of magnitude enhancement compared with the pristine one.

      <title>In&#8197;Vitro Selection of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Degraded Protein Fragments for Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>
Degraded but useful: The use of degradation fragments of protein biomarkers as targets for aptamer selection can produce a DNA aptamer that is compatible with disease diagnosis using clinical samples, as illustrated by an aptamer selected using naturally degraded fragments of Clostridium difficile toxin&#8197;B.







Abstract
Protein biomarkers often exist as degradation fragments in biological samples, and affinity agents derived using a purified protein may not recognize them, limiting their value for clinical diagnosis. Herein, we present a method to overcome this issue, by selecting aptamers against a degraded form of the toxin&#8197;B protein, which is a marker for diagnosing toxigenic Clostridium difficile infections. This approach has led to isolation of a DNA aptamer that recognizes degraded toxin&#8197;B, fresh toxin&#8197;B, and toxin&#8197;B spiked into human stool samples. DNA aptamers selected using intact recombinant toxin&#8197;B failed to recognize degraded toxin&#8197;B, which is the form present in stored stool samples. Using this new aptamer, we produced a simple paper&#8208;based analytical device for colorimetric detection of toxin&#8197;B in stool samples, or in the NAP1 strain of Clostridium difficile. The combined aptamer&#8208;selection and paper&#8208;sensing strategy can expand the practical utility of DNA aptamers in clinical diagnosis.

      <title>Stable Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins (mNHOs)</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly charged: A new class of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins is described featuring a highly ylidic double bond. The compounds can be utilized as ligands in main&#8208;group and transition metal chemistry. Their donor properties exceed previously reported traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins.







Abstract
We report a new class of stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, featuring a highly polarized (strongly ylidic) double bond. The ground&#8208;state structure cannot be described through an uncharged mesomeric Lewis&#8208;structure, thereby structurally distinguishing them from traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs). mNHOs can easily be obtained through deprotonation of the corresponding methylated N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium and N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;imidazolium salts, respectively. In their reactivity, they represent strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligands as shown by their coordination complexes of rhodium and boron. Their calculated proton affinities, their experimentally derived basicities (competition experiments), as well as donor abilities (Tolman electronic parameter; TEP) exceed the so far reported class of NHOs.

      <title>Impact of Positional Isomerism on Pathway Complexity in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>
A matter of position: Rational placement of functional groups for weak interactions has been exploited as a new method for pathway control in aqueous self&#8208;assembly. The results may contribute to understanding the molecular design principles that govern the outcome of self&#8208;assembly processes in water.







Abstract
Pathway complexity has become an important topic in recent years due to its relevance in the optimization of molecular assembly processes, which typically require precise sample preparation protocols. Alternatively, competing aggregation pathways can be controlled by molecular design, which primarily rely on geometrical changes of the building blocks. However, understanding how to control pathway complexity by molecular design remains elusive and new approaches are needed. Herein, we exploit positional isomerism as a new molecular design strategy for pathway control in aqueous self&#8208;assembly. We compare the self&#8208;assembly of two carboxyl&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic BODIPY dyes that solely differ in the relative position of functional groups. Placement of the carboxyl group at the 2&#8208;position enables efficient pairwise H&#8208;bonding interactions into a single thermodynamic species, whereas meso&#8208;substitution induces pathway complexity due to competing hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Our results show the importance of positional engineering for pathway control in aqueous self&#8208;assembly.

      <title>Design of Complex Solid&#8208;Solution Electrocatalysts by Correlating Configuration, Adsorption Energy Distribution Patterns, and Activity Curves</title>
      <dc:description>
Elementary: The effect of changing elements within high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts with respect to changes in adsorption energies and the correlated characteristic activity curves is analyzed. This concept is verified for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. A targeted design of complex solid&#8208;solution electrocatalysts is significantly enhanced by only screening equiatomic alloys without the need to scan the whole composition range.







Abstract
Complex solid&#8208;solution electrocatalysts (also referred to as high&#8208;entropy alloy) are gaining increasing interest owing to their promising properties which were only recently discovered. With the capability of forming complex single&#8208;phase solid solutions from five or more constituents, they offer unique capabilities of fine&#8208;tuning adsorption energies. However, the elemental complexity within the crystal structure and its effect on electrocatalytic properties is poorly understood. We discuss how addition or replacement of elements affect the adsorption energy distribution pattern and how this impacts the shape and activity of catalytic response curves. We highlight the implications of these conceptual findings on improved screening of new catalyst configurations and illustrate this strategy based on the discovery and experimental evaluation of several highly active complex solid solution nanoparticle catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media.

      <title>Fast Lithium Ion Conduction in Lithium Phosphidoaluminates</title>
      <dc:description>
Lightweight and with fast lithium ion conduction: Solid electrolytes with a fast ion conduction are crucial for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The new material Li9AlP4 combines a high lithium content and a high ionic mobility of 3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with a very low theoretical density of 1.703&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte materials are crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSB) using a nonflammable electrolyte. In order to retain a low lithium&#8208;ion transfer resistance, fast lithium ion conducting solid electrolytes are required. We report on the novel superionic conductor Li9AlP4 which is easily synthesised from the elements via ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing at moderate temperatures and which is characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. This representative of the novel compound class of lithium phosphidoaluminates has, as an undoped material, a remarkable fast ionic conductivity of 3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 29&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as determined by impedance spectroscopy. Temperature&#8208;dependent 7Li NMR spectroscopy supports the fast lithium motion. In addition, Li9AlP4 combines a very high lithium content with a very low theoretical density of 1.703&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The distribution of the Li atoms over the diverse crystallographic positions between the [AlP4]9&#8722; tetrahedra is analyzed by means of DFT calculations.

In addition, Li&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;AlP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; combines a very high lithium content with a very low theoretical density of 1.703&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The distribution of the Li atoms over the diverse crystallographic positions between the [AlP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;9&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra is analyzed by means of DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allosteric Recognition of Homomeric and Heteromeric Pairs of Monosaccharides by a Foldamer Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>
Two monosacharides fit in an aromatic double helical foldamer container. Binding is shown to be selective in terms of the sugar anomer, pyranose/furanose tautomer, and helix handedness, and leads to well defined homomeric or heteromeric complexes. One heteromeric complex selectively forms out of 42 different possibilities.







Abstract
The recognition of either homomeric or heteromeric pairs of pentoses in an aromatic oligoamide double helical foldamer capsule was evidenced by circular dichroism (CD), NMR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cavity of the host was predicted to be large enough to accommodate simultaneously two xylose molecules and to form a 1:2 complex (one container, two saccharides). Solution and solid&#8208;state data revealed the selective recognition of the &#945;&#8208;4C1&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranose tautomer, which is bound at two identical sites in the foldamer cavity. A step further was achieved by sequestering a heteromeric pair of pentoses, that is, one molecule of &#945;&#8208;4C1&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranose and one molecule of &#946;&#8208;1C4&#8208;d&#8208;arabinopyranose despite the symmetrical nature of the host and despite the similarity of the guests. Subtle induced&#8208;fit and allosteric effects are responsible for the outstanding selectivities observed.

      <title>An Air&#8208;Stable Heterobimetallic Si2M2 Tetrahedral Cluster</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterobimetallic tetrahedrane&#8208;type clusters with a Si2M2 (M=Mo, W) core were isolated as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable solids from the corresponding NHC&#8208;stabilized metal silylidene complexes upon abstraction of the NHC. The formation of these clusters by dimerization of intermediate metal silylidyne (M&#8801;Si) complexes was supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable heterobimetallic tetrahedral clusters [Cp(CO)2MSiR]2 (M=Mo or W; R=SitBu3) were isolated from the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized silyl(silylidene) metal complexes Cp(CO)2M=Si(SitBu3)NHC with a mild Lewis acid (BPh3). Alternatively, treatment of the NHC&#8208;stabilized silylidene complex Cp(CO)2W=Si(SitBu3)NHC with stronger Lewis acids such as AlCl3 or B(C6F5)3 resulted in the reversible coordination of the Lewis acid to one of the carbonyl ligands. Computational investigations revealed that the dimerization of the intermediate metal silylidyne (M&#8801;Si) complex to a tetrahedral cluster instead of a planar four&#8208;membered ring is due to steric bulk.

      <title>Active and Unidirectional Acceleration of Biaryl Rotation by a Molecular Motor
</title>
      <dc:description>
An integrated molecular machine setup allows the transmission of potential energy from a motor unit onto a covalently connected, distant, and sterically strongly encumbered biaryl receiver. By action of the motor unit, single&#8208;bond rotation of the receiver is strongly accelerated and forced to proceed unidirectionally.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors possess immense potential as central driving units for future nanotechnology. Integration into larger molecular setups and transduction of their mechanical motions represents the current frontier of research. Herein we report on an integrated molecular machine setup allowing the transmission of potential energy from a motor unit onto a remote receiving entity. The setup consists of a motor unit connected covalently to a distant and sterically encumbered biaryl receiver. By action of the motor unit, single&#8208;bond rotation of the receiver is strongly accelerated and forced to proceed unidirectionally. The transmitted potential energy is directly measured as the extent to which energy degeneration is lifted in the thermal atropisomerization of this biaryl. Energy degeneracy is reduced by more than 1.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and rate accelerations of several orders of magnitude in terms of the rate constants are achieved.

      <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions During the Biosynthesis of Sorbicillinoids</title>
      <dc:description>
One for all: The biosynthetic pathway to dimeric sorbicillinoids and epoxysorbicillinol was reconstituted in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Expression and feeding experiments demonstrated that the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase SorD catalyzes epoxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder addition, and Michael addition reactions in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The sorbicillinoids are a class of biologically active and structurally diverse fungal polyketides arising from sorbicillin. Through co&#8208;expression of sorA, sorB, sorC, and sorD from Trichoderma reesei QM6a, the biosynthetic pathway to epoxysorbicillinol and dimeric sorbicillinoids, which resemble Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;like and Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;like products, was reconstituted in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Expression and feeding experiments demonstrated the crucial requirement of the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase SorD for the formation of dimeric sorbicillinoids, hybrid sorbicillinoids, and epoxysorbicillinol in&#8197;vivo. In contrast to prior reports, SorD catalyses neither the oxidation of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dihydrosorbicillin to sorbicillin nor the oxidation of sorbicillinol to oxosorbicillinol. This is the first report that both the intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder and Michael dimerization reactions, as well as the epoxidation of sorbicillinol are catalysed in&#8197;vivo by SorD.

      <title>Enriching and Quantifying Porous Single Layer 2D Polymers by Exfoliation of Chemically Modified van der Waals Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D polymer with pyrylium groups is transformed into a 2D polymer with pyridine groups by exposure to gaseous ammonia. Liquid phase exfoliation of the latter yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Nanosheet quantification shows that the exfoliation is comparable to graphite, demonstrating the promising potential of this approach, which could also be applied to covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
2D polymer sheets with six positively charged pyrylium groups at each pore edge in a stacked single crystal can be transformed into a 2D polymer with six pyridines per pore by exposure to gaseous ammonia. This reaction furnishes still a crystalline material with tunable protonation degree at regular nano&#8208;sized pores promising as separation membrane. The exfoliation is compared for both 2D polymers with the latter being superior. Its liquid phase exfoliation yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Monolayer contents of &#8776;30&#8201;% are achieved with &#8776;130&#8197;nm sized sheets in mg quantities, corresponding to tens of trillions of monolayers. Quantification of nanosheet sizes, layer number and mass shows that this exfoliation is comparable to graphite. Thus, we expect that recent advances in exfoliation of graphite or inorganic crystals (e.g. scale&#8208;up, printing etc.) can be directly applied to this 2D polymer as well as to covalent organic frameworks.

Its liquid phase exfoliation yields nanosheet dispersions, which can be size&#8208;selected using centrifugation cascades. Monolayer contents of &#8776;30&#8201;% are achieved with &#8776;130&#8197;nm sized sheets in mg quantities, corresponding to tens of trillions of monolayers. Quantification of nanosheet sizes, layer number and mass shows that this exfoliation is comparable to graphite. Thus, we expect that recent advances in exfoliation of graphite or inorganic crystals (e.g. scale&#8208;up, printing etc.) can be directly applied to this 2D polymer as well as to covalent organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regioselective Hydroalkylation and Arylalkylation of Alkynes by Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis: Application and Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Meditation on alkylation: A photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type hydroalkylation of terminal alkynes as well as a one&#8208;pot alkylarylation of alkynes with alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl bromides via a three&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling are presented. The reactions take place efficiently, with excellent regioselectivity and moderate to excellent stereoselectivity under mild conditions.







Abstract
Alkynes are an important class of organic molecules due to their utility as versatile building blocks in synthesis. Although efforts have been devoted to the difunctionalization of alkynes, general and practical strategies for the direct hydroalkylation and alkylarylation of terminal alkynes under mild reaction conditions are less explored. Herein, we report a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type hydroalkylation of terminal alkynes as well as a one&#8208;pot arylalkylation of alkynes with alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl bromides via a three&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling. The results indicate that the transformations proceed via a new mechanism involving a single&#8208;electron transfer with subsequent energy&#8208;transfer activation pathways. Moreover, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence&#8208;spectroscopy measurements, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and wavefunction analysis have been performed to give an insight into the catalytic cycle.

      <title>Promoting the Electrocatalytic Performance of Noble Metal Aerogels by Ligand&#8208;Directed Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>
Worth its weight in gold: Starting from laser&#8208;generated inorganic&#8208;salt&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles, various impurity&#8208;free noble metal aerogels are fabricated, allowing the investigation of their intrinsic properties. Moreover, prominent roles played by ligands, which are interpreted from electron transfer between NMAs and respective ligands, are demonstrated, offering a new dimension to engineer electrocatalytic properties of broad materials.







Abstract
Noble metal aerogels (NMAs) are an emerging class of porous materials. Embracing nano&#8208;sized highly&#8208;active noble metals and porous structures, they display unprecedented performance in diverse electrocatalytic processes. However, various impurities, particularly organic ligands, are often involved in the synthesis and remain in the corresponding products, hindering the investigation of the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of NMAs. Here, starting from laser&#8208;generated inorganic&#8208;salt&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles, various impurity&#8208;free NMAs (Au, Pd, and Au&#8208;Pd aerogels) were fabricated. In this light, we demonstrate not only the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of NMAs, but also the prominent roles played by ligands in tuning electrocatalysis through modulating the electron density of catalysts. These findings may offer a new dimension to engineer and optimize the electrocatalytic performance for various NMAs and beyond.

      <title>Substrate&#8208;Independent Magnetic Bistability in Monolayers of the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Dy2ScN@C80 on Metals and Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Monolayers of Dy2ScN@C80 exhibit magnetic hysteresis on Au, Ag, and MgO|Ag substrates. The substrates influence the ordering of the endohedral cluster, but do not affect the width of the hysteresis. The carbon cage protects the endohedral magnetic cluster and thus ensures that it sustains magnetic bistability.







Abstract
Magnetic hysteresis is demonstrated for monolayers of the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) Dy2ScN@C80 deposited on Au(111), Ag(100), and MgO|Ag(100) surfaces by vacuum sublimation. The topography and electronic structure of Dy2ScN@C80 adsorbed on Au(111) were studied by STM. X&#8208;ray magnetic CD studies show that the Dy2ScN@C80 monolayers exhibit similarly broad magnetic hysteresis independent on the substrate used, but the orientation of the Dy2ScN cluster depends strongly on the surface. DFT calculations show that the extent of the electronic interaction of the fullerene molecules with the surface is increasing dramatically from MgO to Au(111) and Ag(100). However, the charge redistribution at the fullerene&#8208;surface interface is fully absorbed by the carbon cage, leaving the state of the endohedral cluster intact. This Faraday cage effect of the fullerene preserves the magnetic bistability of fullerene&#8208;SMMs on conducting substrates and facilitates their application in molecular spintronics.

      <title>Image&#8208;Based Morphological Profiling Identifies a Lysosomotropic, Iron&#8208;Sequestering Autophagy Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>
I heard you paint cells: Morphological profiling using the &#8220;cell painting&#8221; assay revealed that autoquin impairs lysosomal integrity, iron homeostasis, and autophagy.







Abstract
Chemical proteomics is widely applied in small&#8208;molecule target identification. However, in general it does not identify non&#8208;protein small&#8208;molecule targets, and thus, alternative methods for target identification are in high demand. We report the discovery of the autophagy inhibitor autoquin and the identification of its molecular mode of action using image&#8208;based morphological profiling in the cell painting assay. A compound&#8208;induced fingerprint representing changes in 579 cellular parameters revealed that autoquin accumulates in lysosomes and inhibits their fusion with autophagosomes. In addition, autoquin sequesters Fe2+ in lysosomes, resulting in an increase of lysosomal reactive oxygen species and ultimately cell death. Such a mechanism of action would have been challenging to unravel by current methods. This work demonstrates the potential of the cell painting assay to deconvolute modes of action of small molecules, warranting wider application in chemical biology.

      <title>Triple&#8208;Helix&#8208;Stabilizing Effects in Collagen Model Peptides Containing PPII&#8208;Helix&#8208;Preorganized Diproline Modules</title>
      <dc:description>
Collagen model peptides represent attractive materials for biomedical applications. To rationally design peptide properties, knowledge about the impact of structural modifications is fundamental. Therefore, the impact of covalent diproline rigidification was studied and correlated with theoretical findings to understand the symphony of (de)stabilizing effects in the triple helix.







Abstract
Collagen model peptides (CMPs) serve as tools for understanding stability and function of the collagen triple helix and have a potential for biomedical applications. In the past, interstrand cross&#8208;linking or conformational preconditioning of proline units through stereoelectronic effects have been utilized in the design of stabilized CMPs. To further study the effects determining collagen triple helix stability we investigated a series of CMPs containing synthetic diproline&#8208;mimicking modules (ProMs), which were preorganized in a PPII&#8208;helix&#8208;type conformation by a functionalizable intrastrand C2 bridge. Results of CD&#8208;based denaturation studies were correlated with calculated (DFT) conformational preferences of the ProM units, revealing that the relative helix stability is mainly governed by an interplay of main&#8208;chain preorganization, ring&#8208;flip preference, adaptability, and steric effects. Triple helix integrity was proven by crystal structure analysis and binding to HSP47.

      <title>An Adaptable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Macrocycle Hosting Copper in Three Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>
A neutral hybrid macrocycle L with two trans&#8208;positioned N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and two pyridine donors can adapt to the different geometric and electronic preferences of CuI, CuII, and CuIII. This allows isolation of a series of complexes hosting Cu in all three oxidation states, and their reversible interconversion at moderate potentials and with minor structural rearrangement.







Abstract
A neutral hybrid macrocycle with two trans&#8208;positioned N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and two pyridine donors hosts copper in three oxidation states (+I&#8211;+III) in a series of structurally characterized complexes (1&#8211;3). Redox interconversion of [LCu]+/2+/3+ is electrochemically (quasi)reversible and occurs at moderate potentials (E1/2=&#8722;0.45&#8197;V and +0.82&#8197;V (vs. Fc/Fc+)). A linear CNHC&#8208;Cu&#8208;CNHC arrangement and hemilability of the two pyridine donors allows the ligand to adapt to the different stereoelectronic and coordination requirements of CuI versus CuII/CuIII. Analytical methods such as NMR, UV/Vis, IR, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Cu K&#946; high&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution fluorescence detection X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations, give insight into the geometric and electronic structures of the complexes. The XAS signatures of 1&#8211;3 are textbook examples for CuI, CuII, and CuIII species. Facile 2&#8208;electron interconversion combined with the exposure of two basic pyridine N sites in the reduced CuI form suggest that [LCu]+/2+/3+ may operate in catalysis via coupled 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ transfer.

      <title>Structural Insight into IAPP&#8208;Derived Amyloid Inhibitors and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
      <dc:description>
ISM inhibitors are highly dynamic assemblies and exchange between monomeric and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight states. In both states, the ISM peptide adopts a &#946;&#8208;loop&#8208;like structure that provides a suitable surface for sequestration of A&#946;40 in the colloidal state. ISM inhibitors thus exploit multivalency by self&#8208;association to yield high substrate avidity.







Abstract
Designed peptides derived from the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) cross&#8208;amyloid interaction surface with A&#946; (termed interaction surface mimics or ISMs) have been shown to be highly potent inhibitors of A&#946; amyloid self&#8208;assembly. However, the molecular mechanism of their function is not well understood. Using solution&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy in combination with ensemble&#8208;averaged dynamics simulations and other biophysical methods including TEM, fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, and DLS, we characterize ISM structural preferences and interactions. We find that the ISM peptide R3&#8208;GI is highly dynamic, can adopt a &#946;&#8208;like structure, and oligomerizes into colloid&#8208;like assemblies in a process that is reminiscent of liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Our results suggest that such assemblies yield multivalent surfaces for interactions with A&#946;40. Sequestration of substrates into these colloid&#8208;like structures provides a mechanistic basis for ISM function and the design of novel potent anti&#8208;amyloid molecules.

      <title>Effective and Reversible Carbon Dioxide Insertion into Cerium Pyrazolates</title>
      <dc:description>
CO2 sponges: Cerous and ceric pyrazolates have been demonstrated to insert carbon dioxide and afford the complexes [CeIII4(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)4]. The insertion is reversible and can be exploited for the catalytic formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides. The potentially reducing behavior of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co&#8208;catalyst is also revealed.







Abstract
The homoleptic pyrazolate complexes [CeIII4(Me2pz)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz)4]2 quantitatively insert CO2 to give [CeIII4(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)4], respectively (Me2pz=3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazolato). This process is reversible for both complexes, as observed by in&#8197;situ IR and NMR spectroscopy in solution and by TGA in the solid state. By adjusting the molar ratio, one molecule of CO2 per [CeIV(Me2pz)4] complex could be inserted to give trimetallic [Ce3(Me2pz)9(Me2pz&#8901;CO2)3(thf)]. Both the cerous and ceric insertion products catalyze the formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 under mild conditions. In the absence of epoxide, the ceric catalyst is prone to reduction by the co&#8208;catalyst tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium bromide (TBAB).

      <title>Advanced Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple strain approach was explored to prepare a NiFe&#8208;based ORR/OER electrocatalyst derived from surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks by rational introduction of functional groups into the organic linker. The catalyst exhibits an excellent OER activity, reaching industrially relevant current densities. As a bifunctional catalyst, it demonstrates a narrow overpotential window of &#8776;0.69&#8197;V in 0.1&#8201;m KOH, surpassing reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are considered as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are important for many energy provision technologies, such as electrolyzers, fuel cells and some types of advanced batteries. In this work, a &#8220;strain modulation&#8221; approach has been applied through the use of surface&#8208;mounted NiFe&#8208;MOFs in order to design an advanced bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst. The material exhibits an excellent OER activity in alkaline media, reaching an industrially relevant current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of only &#8776;210&#8197;mV. It demonstrates operational long&#8208;term stability even at a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits the so far narrowest &#8220;overpotential window&#8221; &#916;EORR&#8208;OER of 0.69&#8197;V in 0.1&#8201;m KOH with a mass loading being two orders of magnitude lower than that of benchmark electrocatalysts.

      <title>Amphiphilic Polyphenylene Dendron Conjugates for Surface Remodeling of Adenovirus&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
Amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrons were prepared and bound to gene vector adenovirus 5 (Ad5) through polar and nonpolar surface groups that control its cellular uptake. The new dendron layer at the Ad5 surface provides reactive groups that are accessible for post&#8208;modifications at the virus surface.







Abstract
Amphiphilic surface groups play an important role in many biological processes. The synthesis of amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrimer branches (dendrons), providing alternating hydrophilic and lipophilic surface groups and one reactive ethynyl group at the core is reported. The amphiphilic surface groups serve as biorecognition units that bind to the surface of adenovirus&#8197;5 (Ad5), which is a common vector in gene therapy. The Ad5/dendron complexes showed high gene transduction efficiencies in coxsackie&#8208;adenovirus receptor (CAR)&#8208;negative cells. Moreover, the dendrons offer incorporation of new functions at the dendron core by in situ post&#8208;modifications, even when bound to the Ad5 surface. Surfaces coated with these dendrons were analyzed for their blood&#8208;protein binding capacity, which is essential to predict their performance in the blood stream. A new platform for introducing bioactive groups to the Ad5 surface without chemically modifying the virus particles is provided.

      <title>A Supported Bismuth Halide Perovskite Photocatalyst for Selective Aliphatic and Aromatic C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Better with bismuth: A range of mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;supported small bismuth halide perovskite nanoparticles were prepared. They were found to be very promising photocatalysts for selective aromatic and aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Direct selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to oxygenates by O2 is challenging. Catalysts are limited by the low activity and narrow application scope, and the main focus is on active C&#8722;H bonds at benzylic positions. In this work, stable, lead&#8208;free, Cs3Bi2Br9 halide perovskites are integrated within the pore channels of mesoporous SBA&#8208;15 silica and demonstrate their photocatalytic potentials for C&#8722;H bond activation. The composite photocatalysts can effectively oxidize hydrocarbons (C5 to C16 including aromatic and aliphatic alkanes) with a conversion rate up to 32900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and excellent selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) towards aldehydes and ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Isotopic labeling, in&#8197;situ spectroscopic studies, and DFT calculations reveal that well&#8208;dispersed small perovskite nanoparticles (2&#8211;5&#8197;nm) possess enhanced electron&#8211;hole separation and a close contact with hydrocarbons that facilitates C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photoinduced charges.

      <title>Confined Crystallization of Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles in Block&#8208;Copolymer Micelles</title>
      <dc:description>
Spin doctor: The synthesis and characterization of spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles with improved spin&#8208;crossover properties in a block&#8208;copolymer matrix gives a spin&#8208;crossover nanocomposite which is stable enough to allow further processing, such as electrospinning from solution.







Abstract
Nanoparticles of the spin&#8208;crossover coordination polymer [FeL(bipy)]n were synthesized by confined crystallization within the core of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles. The 4VP units in the micellar core act as coordination sites for the Fe complex. In the bulk material, the spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles in the core are well isolated from each other allowing thermal treatment without disintegration of their structure. During annealing above the glass transition temperature of the PS block, the transition temperature is shifted gradually to higher temperatures from the as&#8208;synthesized product (T1/2&#8595;=163&#8197;K and T1/2&#8593;=170&#8197;K) to the annealed product (T1/2&#8595;=203&#8197;K and T1/2&#8593;=217&#8197;K) along with an increase in hysteresis width from 6&#8197;K to 14&#8197;K. Thus, the spin&#8208;crossover properties can be shifted towards the properties of the related bulk material. The stability of the nanocomposite allows further processing, such as electrospinning from solution.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Cooperation of Single&#8208;Atom Rh and Ru Solid Catalysts for a Selective Tandem Olefin Isomerization&#8208;Hydrosilylation Process</title>
      <dc:description>
Singles in tandem: The one&#8208;pot integration of Ru1/CeO2 and Rh1/CeO2 single&#8208;atom solid catalysts enables a highly selective olefin isomerization&#8208;hydrosilylation tandem process for the conversion of terminal and internal olefins, as well as mixtures thereof, into industrially relevant terminal organosilane compounds.







Abstract
Realizing the full potential of oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) is key to successfully bridge the gap between the fields of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Here we show that the one&#8208;pot combination of Ru1/CeO2 and Rh1/CeO2 SACs enables a highly selective olefin isomerization&#8208;hydrosilylation tandem process, hitherto restricted to molecular catalysts in solution. Individually, monoatomic Ru and Rh sites show a remarkable reaction specificity for olefin double&#8208;bond migration and anti&#8208;Markovnikov &#945;&#8208;olefin hydrosilylation, respectively. First&#8208;principles DFT calculations ascribe such selectivity to differences in the binding strength of the olefin substrate to the monoatomic metal centers. The single&#8208;pot cooperation of the two SACs allows the production of terminal organosilane compounds with high regio&#8208;selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) even from industrially&#8208;relevant complex mixtures of terminal and internal olefins, alongside a straightforward catalyst recycling and reuse. These results demonstrate the significance of oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal catalysts in tandem catalytic reactions, which are central for the intensification of chemical processes.

      <title>Back Cover: A Convergent Total Synthesis of the Death Cap Toxin &#945;&#8208;Amanitin (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The death cap toxin &#945;&#8208;amanitin has received increasing attention as a toxin component of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates in cancer research. A new route to this bicyclic octapeptide that is based on a convergent approach in solution phase is reported by R.&#8197;D. S&#252;ssmuth and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;5500. The straightforward synthesis gives access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids l&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on multigram scale.

A mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry was synthesized by S.&#8197;V. Ovsyannikov and co&#8208;workers, as reported in their Communication on page&#8197;5632. Near 275&#8197;K, the material undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for use in innovative applications.

      <title>Towards Reliable and Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS): From Key Parameters to Good Analytical Practice</title>
      <dc:description>
Parameters and pitfalls: Key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are highlighted. Good analytical practice is proposed to increase the inter&#8208;laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.







Abstract
Experimental results obtained in different laboratories world&#8208;wide by researchers using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can differ significantly.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parameters and pitfalls&lt;/b&gt;: Key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are highlighted. Good analytical practice is proposed to increase the inter&#8208;laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental results obtained in different laboratories world&#8208;wide by researchers using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can differ significantly. We, an international team of scientists with long&#8208;standing expertise in SERS, address this issue from our perspective by presenting considerations on reliable and quantitative SERS. The central idea of this joint effort is to highlight key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in the literature. To that end, we provide here a series of recommendations on: a)&#8197;the characterization of solid and colloidal SERS substrates by correlative electron and optical microscopy and spectroscopy, b)&#8197;on the determination of the SERS enhancement factor (EF), including suitable Raman reporter/probe molecules, and finally on c)&#8197;good analytical practice.

Recent groundbreaking studies on organoferrates have demonstrated that coordinatively unsaturated three&#8208;coordinate&#8208;&#963;&#8208;alkylferrates are active catalysts in Fe&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings with Grignard reagents and that pronounced solvent and counterion effects dictate metalate speciation and catalyst activity.

      <title>Polyhalogen and Polyinterhalogen Anions from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
      <dc:description>
The diverse field of polyhalogen anions and polyinterhalide chemistry is explored in terms of the structural diversity and chemical behavior of these anions as well as their applications. While the first anions of this class were described almost one hundred years ago, recent research has focused on the synthesis, structural diversity, and bonding of polyhalogen anions of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.







Abstract
This Review deals with the evolving field of polyhalogen chemistry, specifically polyhalogen anions (polyhalides). In addition to a historical outline, current progress in synthetic approaches towards the formation of polyfluorides, polychlorides, polybromides, and polyinterhalides is also illustrated. The structural diversity of polyhalides has substantially increased in the past decade, especially for polychlorides and polybromides, which are commonly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Polyfluorides have been examined by sophisticated state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and investigated spectroscopically in noble gas matrix&#8208;isolation experiments under cryogenic conditions at 4&#8197;K. The bonding in such polyhalide systems is also discussed. The last Section deals with applications of polyhalides in halogenation reactions and electrochemistry as well as their use as reactive ionic liquids, emphasizing the promising future of polyhalogen chemistry.

      <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Thianthrenation of Olefins To Access Versatile Alkenyl Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
The regioselective synthesis of sulfonium&#8208;based alkenyl electrophiles was achieved directly through C&#8722;H functionalization of simple olefins. The alkenyl sulfonium salts participate in palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed (pseudo)halogenation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a regioselective alkenyl electrophile synthesis from unactivated olefins that is based on a direct and regioselective C&#8722;H thianthrenation reaction. The selectivity is proposed to arise from an unusual inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The alkenyl sulfonium salts can serve as electrophiles in palladium&#8208; and ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions to make alkenyl C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;Br, and C&#8722;SCF3 bonds with stereoretention.

      <title>Helical Nanographenes Containing an Azulene Unit: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
An odd contribution: Azulene&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes with global aromaticity are synthesized by a Scholl&#8208;type cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly reveals the formation of an azulene unit in the helical &#960;&#8208;system. The embedded azulene core adopts a highly twisted conformation and is less aromatic than pristine azulene.







Abstract
Three unprecedented helical nanographenes (1, 2, and 3) containing an azulene unit are synthesized. The resultant helical structures are unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The embedded azulene unit in 2 possesses a record&#8208;high twisting degree (16.1&#176;) as a result of the contiguous steric repulsion at the helical inner rim. Structural analysis in combination with theoretical calculations reveals that these helical nanographenes manifest a global aromatic structure, while the inner azulene unit exhibits weak antiaromatic character. Furthermore, UV/Vis&#8208;spectral measurements reveal that superhelicenes 2 and 3 possess narrow energy gaps (2: 1.88&#8197;eV; 3: 2.03&#8197;eV), as corroborated by cyclic voltammetry and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The stable oxidized and reduced states of 2 and 3 are characterized by in&#8208;situ EPR/Vis&#8211;NIR spectroelectrochemistry. Our study provides a novel synthetic strategy for helical nanographenes containing azulene units as well as their associated structures and physical properties.

      <title>Oxalyl&#8208;CoA Decarboxylase Enables Nucleophilic One&#8208;Carbon Extension of Aldehydes to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
The thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily contains promiscuous members that can perform nucleophilic C1&#8208;extensions of aldehydes to yield 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. An enzymatic cascade consisting of OXC, oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase, and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase converted oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
The synthesis of complex molecules from simple, renewable carbon units is the goal of a sustainable economy. Here we explored the biocatalytic potential of the thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily that naturally catalyzes the shortening of acyl&#8208;CoA thioester substrates through the release of the C1&#8208;unit formyl&#8208;CoA. We show that the OXC/HACL superfamily contains promiscuous members that can be reversed to perform nucleophilic C1&#8208;extensions of various aldehydes to yield the corresponding 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. We improved the catalytic properties of Methylorubrum extorquens OXC by rational enzyme engineering and combined it with two newly described enzymes&#8212;a specific oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase. This enzymatic cascade enabled continuous conversion of oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into valuable (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.

Here we explored the biocatalytic potential of the thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent (ThDP) oxalyl&#8208;CoA decarboxylase (OXC)/2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA lyase (HACL) superfamily that naturally catalyzes the shortening of acyl&#8208;CoA thioester substrates through the release of the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;unit formyl&#8208;CoA. We show that the OXC/HACL superfamily contains promiscuous members that can be reversed to perform nucleophilic C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;extensions of various aldehydes to yield the corresponding 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesters. We improved the catalytic properties of Methylorubrum extorquens OXC by rational enzyme engineering and combined it with two newly described enzymes&#8212;a specific oxalyl&#8208;CoA synthetase and a 2&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase. This enzymatic cascade enabled continuous conversion of oxalate and aromatic aldehydes into valuable (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids with enantiomeric excess up to 99&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Unexpected Transannular [4+2] Cycloaddition during the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Norcembrene&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
They may look alike&#8230; During studies toward the total synthesis of the norditerpene natural product norcembrene&#8197;5, one diastereomer of a key intermediate (&#945;&#8208;OAc at C13) underwent clean and spontaneous Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition at room temperature (see scheme). However, the corresponding &#946;&#8197;isomer did not undergo a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but was oxidized to the corresponding furanone, which was further transformed into norcembrene&#8197;5.







Abstract
We report a concise and versatile total synthesis of the diterpenoid (+)&#8208;norcembrene&#8197;5 from simple building blocks. Ring&#8208;closing metathesis and an auxiliary&#8208;directed 1,4&#8208;addition are the key steps of our synthetic route. During the synthesis, an unprecedented, highly oxidized pentacyclic structural motif was established from a furanocembranoid through transannular [4+2] cycloaddition.

      <title>Phosphanylalanes and Phosphanylgallanes Stabilized only by a Lewis Base</title>
      <dc:description>
Back to bases: The first parent phosphanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes stabilized only by a Lewis base were synthesized. These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl and LiPH2&#8901;DME and a H2 elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H3 and PH3, respectively.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the first parent phosphanylalane and phosphanylgallane stabilized only by a Lewis base (LB) are reported. The corresponding substituted compounds, such as IDipp&#8901;GaH2PCy2 (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were obtained by the reaction of LiPCy2 with IDipp&#8901;GaH2Cl. However, the LB&#8208;stabilized parent compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH2PH2 (3) and IDipp&#8901;AlH2PH2 (4) were prepared via a salt metathesis of LiPH2&#8901;DME with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) or by H2&#8208;elimination reactions of IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H3 (E&#8242;=Ga, Al) and PH3, respectively. The compounds could be isolated as crystalline solids and completely characterized. Supporting DFT computations gave insight into the reaction pathways as well as into the stability of these compounds with respect to their decomposition behavior.

      <title>Supracolloidal Self&#8208;Assembly of Divalent Janus 3D DNA Origami via Programmable Multivalent Host/Guest Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Combined forces: Adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin functionalized 3D DNA origami Janus colloids are used for cooperative multivalent interaction enhancement of supramolecular host/guest interactions resulting in 1D&#8208;fibril formation. The merger of DNA nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry gives access to study multivalent effects at a colloidal level.







Abstract
We introduce divalent 3D DNA origami cuboids as truly monodisperse colloids and harness their ability for precision functionalization with defined patches and defined numbers of supramolecular binding motifs. We demonstrate that even adamantane/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin host/guest inclusion complexes of moderate association strength can induce efficient supracolloidal fibrillization at high dilution of the 3D DNA Origami as a result of cooperative multivalency. We show details on the assembly of Janus and non&#8208;Janus 3D DNA origami into supracolloidal homo&#8208; and heterofibrils with respect to multivalency effects, electrostatic screening, and stoichiometry. We believe that the merger of 3D DNA origami with colloidal self&#8208;assembly and supramolecular motifs provides new synergies at the interface of these disciplines to better understand multivalency effects, to promote structural complexity, and add non&#8208;DNA assembling and switching mechanisms to DNA nanoscience.

      <title>[SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+: Highly Coordinated Sn+III8 Subunit with Fragile Carbonyl Clips</title>
      <dc:description>
You're clinging! In a clip&#8208;like fashion, Fe(CO)4 groups surround a central SnI8 subunit in [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+, which has an unprecedentedly high coordination of tin with the most voluminous, stable halide.







Abstract
[SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4][Al2Cl7]2 contains the [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+ cation with an unprecedented highly coordinated, bicapped SnI8 prism. Given the eightfold coordination with the most voluminous stable halide, it is all the more surprising that this SnI8 arrangement is surrounded only by fragile Fe(CO)4 groups in a clip&#8208;like fashion. Inspite of a predominantly ionic bonding situation in [SnI8{Fe(CO)4}4]2+, the I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722; distances are considerably shortened (down to 371&#8197;pm) and significantly less than the van der Waals distance (420&#8197;pm). The title compound is characterized by single&#8208;crystal structure analysis, spectroscopic methods (EDXS, FTIR, Raman, UV/Vis, M&#246;ssbauer), thermogravimetry, and density functional theory methods.

      <title>Negatively Charged Yellow&#8208;Emitting 1&#8208;Aminopyrene Dyes for Reductive Amination and Fluorescence Detection of Glycans</title>
      <dc:description>
Bright 1&#8208;aminopyrenes (&#1013;&#8776;20.000 m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) with six negative charges (at pH&#8805;8) and high mobility in the electric field are designed for labeling and fluorescence detection of glycans. The right and left lanes in the figure show the gel electrophoresis bands of new and reference dyes (lowest bands) and their conjugates.







Abstract
1&#8208;Aminopyrenes with three &#969;&#8208;hydroxylated N&#8208;alkylsulfonamido or alkylsulfonyl residues in positions 3, 6, and 8 were prepared, O&#8208;phosphorylated, and applied for reductive amination of oligosaccharides. The dyes (&#1013;&#8776;20&#8201;000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) with six negative charges (pH&#8805;8) and low m/z ratios enable labeling and fluorescence detection of reducing sugars (glycans) related to the most structurally and functionally diverse class of natural products. Under excitation with a 488&#8197;nm laser, the new glycoconjugates emit yellow light of about 560&#8197;nm, outperforming (with respect to brightness and faster electrophoretic mobilities) the corresponding APTS derivatives (benchmark dye with green emission in conjugates).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bright 1&#8208;aminopyrenes&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;20.000 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with six negative charges (at pH&#8805;8) and high mobility in the electric field are designed for labeling and fluorescence detection of glycans. The right and left lanes in the figure show the gel electrophoresis bands of new and reference dyes (lowest bands) and their conjugates.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&#8208;Aminopyrenes with three &#969;&#8208;hydroxylated N&#8208;alkylsulfonamido or alkylsulfonyl residues in positions 3, 6, and 8 were prepared, O&#8208;phosphorylated, and applied for reductive amination of oligosaccharides. The dyes (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;20&#8201;000&#8201;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with six negative charges (pH&#8805;8) and low &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; ratios enable labeling and fluorescence detection of reducing sugars (glycans) related to the most structurally and functionally diverse class of natural products. Under excitation with a 488&#8197;nm laser, the new glycoconjugates emit yellow light of about 560&#8197;nm, outperforming (with respect to brightness and faster electrophoretic mobilities) the corresponding APTS derivatives (benchmark dye with green emission in conjugates).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Functionalized Alkylzinc Reagents with (Hetero)Aryl Halides</title>
      <dc:description>
A cheap Co&#8208;upling: A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of functionalized primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl halides is described. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions using secondary cyclohexylzinc reagents proceed in a highly diastereoselective fashion furnishing the corresponding products in up to 98:2 d.r.

Abstract
A combination of 10&#8201;% CoCl2 and 20&#8201;% 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands enables cross&#8208;coupling of functionalized primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents with various (hetero)aryl halides. Couplings with 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;substituted cycloalkylzinc reagents proceeded diastereoselectively leading to functionalized heterocycles with high diastereoselectivities of up to 98:2. Furthermore, alkynyl bromides react with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents providing the alkylated alkynes.

Abstract
A highly atroposelective (up to 97&#8201;% ee) Au&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;diols is reported starting from a range of substituted benzyl alkynones.

      <title>1,1&#8208;Ethenediol: The Long Elusive Enol of Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Finally made: The hitherto unreported 1,1&#8208;ethenediol, the higher energy tautomer of acetic acid, was synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. It can be readily prepared through thermal decarboxylation of malonic acid, as has generally often been implied in the synthetically highly valuable reactions of 1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acids.







Abstract
We present the first spectroscopic identification of hitherto unknown 1,1&#8208;ethenediol, the enol tautomer of acetic acid. The title compound was generated in the gas phase through flash vacuum pyrolysis of malonic acid at 400&#8201;&#176;C. The pyrolysis products were subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10&#8197;K and characterized spectroscopically by means of IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy together with matching its spectral data with computations at the CCSD(T)/cc&#8208;pCVTZ and B3LYP/6&#8211;311++G(2d,2p) levels of theory. Upon photolysis at &#955;=254&#8197;nm, the enol rearranges to acetic acid and ketene.

      <title>Functional Disruption of the Cancer&#8208;Relevant Interaction between Survivin and Histone H3 with a Guanidiniocarbonyl Pyrrole Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
Effective interruption: The supramolecular guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole ligand L1 targets the Histone H3 binding site of the protein Survivin, which is highly upregulated in cancer. Inhibiting the interaction between the two proteins successfully reduced cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The protein Survivin is highly upregulated in most cancers and considered to be a key player in carcinogenesis. We explored a supramolecular approach to address Survivin as a drug target by inhibiting the protein&#8211;protein interaction of Survivin and its functionally relevant binding partner Histone H3. Ligand L1 is based on the guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole cation and serves as a highly specific anion binder in order to target the interaction between Survivin and Histone H3. NMR titration confirmed binding of L1 to Survivin's Histone H3 binding site. The inhibition of the Survivin&#8211;Histone H3 interaction and consequently a reduction of cancer cell proliferation were demonstrated by microscopic and cellular assays.

      <title>Analysis of an Active Deformylation Mechanism of 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) in Stem Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Please release Me, let Me go: The demethylation process of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC), which is associated with the reactivation of silenced genes, was investigated. In the course of active demethylation in stem cells, mdC is oxidized to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC), which is then deformylated, potentially after addition of a nucleophile at the C6&#8208;position.







Abstract
The removal of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC) from promoter elements is associated with reactivation of the silenced corresponding genes. It takes place through an active demethylation process involving the oxidation of mdC to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (hmdC) and further on to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;deoxycytidine (cadC) with the help of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent Tet oxygenases. The next step can occur through the action of a glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome for replacement by dC. A second pathway is proposed to involve C&#8722;C bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. A 6&#8208;aza&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (a&#8208;fdC) probe molecule was synthesized and fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mouse embryonic stem cells, together with a 2&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated fdC analogue (F&#8208;fdC). While deformylation of F&#8208;fdC was clearly observed in&#8197;vivo, it did not occur with a&#8208;fdC, thus suggesting that the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleaving deformylation is initiated by nucleophilic activation.

The next step can occur through the action of a glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome for replacement by dC. A second pathway is proposed to involve C&#8722;C bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. A 6&#8208;aza&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (a&#8208;fdC) probe molecule was synthesized and fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mouse embryonic stem cells, together with a 2&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated fdC analogue (F&#8208;fdC). While deformylation of F&#8208;fdC was clearly observed in&#8197;vivo, it did not occur with a&#8208;fdC, thus suggesting that the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleaving deformylation is initiated by nucleophilic activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biosynthesis of Pseudomonas&#8208;Derived Butenolides</title>
      <dc:description>
Diversity&#8208;oriented biosynthesis: Styrolides are a novel class of bacterially produced butenolides that represent a structural and biosynthetic link between tetronic acids and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones. A comprehensive picture of the biosynthesis of the styrolides and related acaterin is provided.







Abstract
Butenolides are well&#8208;known signaling molecules in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Here, we describe a novel class of butenolides isolated from a Gram&#8208;negative Pseudomonas strain, the styrolides. Structure elucidation was aided by the total synthesis of styrolide&#8197;A. Transposon mutagenesis enabled us to identify the styrolide biosynthetic gene cluster, and by using a homology search, we discovered the related and previously unknown acaterin biosynthetic gene cluster in another Pseudomonas species. Mutagenesis, heterologous expression, and identification of key shunt and intermediate products were crucial to propose a biosynthetic pathway for both Pseudomonas&#8208;derived butenolides. Comparative transcriptomics suggests a link between styrolide formation and the regulatory networks of the bacterium.

Electrochemical access to aza&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (aza&#8208;PAHs) was achieved via rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed domino C&#8722;H functionalization. A multifunctional O&#8208;methylamidoxime facilitates the high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (aza&#8208;PAHs) have found broad applications in material sciences. Herein, a modular electrochemical synthesis of aza&#8208;PAHs was developed via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H activation and alkyne annulation. A multifunctional O&#8208;methylamidoxime enabled the high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The isolation of two key rhodacyclic intermediates made it possible to delineate the exact order of three C&#8722;H activation steps. In addition, the metalla&#8208;electrocatalyzed multiple C&#8722;H transformation is characterized by unique functional group tolerance, including highly reactive iodo and azido groups.

      <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization&#8212;Prediction of Selectivity in Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Competition Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Assessment of an iridium(I) catalyst for C&#8722;H activation in the deuteration of phenyl compounds substituted with different functional directing groups is disclosed. Competition experiments and DFT calculations have revealed a clear order of the directing groups in hydrogen isotope exchange reactions.







Abstract
An assessment of the C&#8722;H activation catalyst [(COD)Ir(IMes)(PPh3)]PF6 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) in the deuteration of phenyl rings containing different functional directing groups is divulged. Competition experiments have revealed a clear order of the directing groups in the hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with an iridium&#8197;(I) catalyst. Through DFT calculations the iridium&#8211;substrate coordination complex has been identified to be the main trigger for reactivity and selectivity in the competition situation with two or more directing groups. We postulate that the competition concept found in this HIE reaction can be used to explain regioselectivities in other transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization reactions of complex drug&#8208;type molecules as long as a C&#8722;H activation mechanism is involved.

      <title>A Universal Nano&#8208;capillary Based Method of Catalyst Immobilization for Liquid&#8208;Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel universal method of single catalyst nanoparticle immobilization on the working electrode without damaging the fragile membrane allows single NixB nanoparticle catalysts to be monitored in&#8197;situ during ethanol oxidation by means of TEM movies.







Abstract
A universal nano&#8208;capillary based method for sample deposition on the silicon nitride membrane of liquid&#8208;cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) chips is demonstrated. It is applicable to all substances which can be dispersed in a solvent and are suitable for drop casting, including catalysts, biological samples, and polymers. Most importantly, this method overcomes limitations concerning sample immobilization due to the fragility of the ultra&#8208;thin silicon nitride membrane required for electron transmission. Thus, a straightforward way is presented to widen the research area of LCTEM to encompass any sample which can be externally deposited beforehand. Using this method, NixB nanoparticles are deposited on the &#956;m&#8208;scale working electrode of the LCTEM chip and in&#8197;situ observation of single catalyst particles during ethanol oxidation is for the first time successfully monitored by means of TEM movies.

      <title>Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Transfer Reactions for Mild O&#8208;H Functionalization of Unreactive Alcohols
</title>
      <dc:description>
A light&#8208;bulb moment: Photoinduced proton&#8208;transfer reactions of diazoacetates enable the highly efficient O&#8208;H functionalization of halogenated, unreactive alcohols under stoichiometric reaction conditions. This approach offers a new reactivity pattern of diazoacetates.







Abstract
Hexafluoroisopropanol is typically considered as an unreactive solvent and not as a reagent in organic synthesis. Herein, we report on a mild and efficient photochemical reaction of aryl diazoacetates with hexafluoroisopropanol that enables, under stoichiometric reaction conditions, the synthesis of fluorinated ethers in excellent yield. Mechanistic studies indicate there is a preorganization of hexafluoroisopropanol and the diazoalkane acts as an unreactive hydrogen&#8208;bonding complex. Only after photoexcitation does this complex undergo a protonation&#8208;substitution reaction to the reaction product. Investigations on the applicability of this photochemical transformation show that a broad variety of acidic alcohols can be subjected to this transformation and thus demonstrate the feasibility of this concept for O&#8208;H functionalization reactions (54 examples, up to 98&#8201;% yield).

      <title>Complex Carbocyclic Skeletons from Aryl Ketones through a Three&#8208;Photon Cascade Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Running up that hill: A major bond reorganization takes the marked arene carbon atom from &#8220;flatland&#8221; to the summit of three&#8208;dimensional hydrocarbon hills. Three photons initiate a cascade reaction to convert the flat aromatic cores of the starting materials into functionalized pentacyclic hydrocarbons (11 examples, 37&#8211;67&#8201;%) that are prone to further ring opening in&#8197;situ or through a two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Starting from readily available 7&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;indanones, products with a tetracyclo[5.3.1.01,704,11]undec&#8208;2&#8208;ene skeleton were obtained upon irradiation at &#955;=350&#8197;nm (eight examples, 49&#8211;67&#8201;% yield). The assembly of the structurally complex carbon framework proceeds in a three&#8208;photon process comprising an ortho photocycloaddition, a disrotatory [4&#960;] photocyclization, and a di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement. The flat aromatic core of the starting material is converted into a functionalized polycyclic hydrocarbon with exit vectors in three dimensions. Ring opening reactions at the central cyclopropane ring were explored, which enable the preparation of tricyclo[5.3.1.04,11]undec&#8208;2&#8208;enes and of tricyclo[6.2.1.01,5]undecanes.

      <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Verwey&#8208;type Transition in Iron Oxide, Fe5O6</title>
      <dc:description>
Charge and order: Crystals of novel mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with an unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry were synthesized and investigated. Near 275&#8197;K, Fe5O6 demonstrates a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a pronounced dimerization and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe chemical bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a highly promising candidate for use in innovative applications.







Abstract
Functional oxides whose physicochemical properties may be reversibly changed at standard conditions are potential candidates for the use in next&#8208;generation nanoelectronic devices. To date, vanadium dioxide (VO2) is the only known simple transition&#8208;metal oxide that demonstrates a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;insulator transition that may be used in such appliances. In this work, we synthesized and investigated the crystals of a novel mixed&#8208;valent iron oxide with an unconventional Fe5O6 stoichiometry. Near 275&#8197;K, Fe5O6 undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and a following formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe chemical bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for the use in innovative applications. We established that the minimal Fe&#8722;Fe distance in the octahedral chains is a key parameter that determines the type and temperature of charge ordering. This model provides new insights into charge&#8208;ordering phenomena in transition&#8208;metal oxides in general.

      <title>A Convergent Total Synthesis of the Death Cap Toxin &#945;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A new route to the toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is presented. The key steps of the convergent [5+1+2]&#8208;synthesis are the preformation of the thioether building block and access to the enantiomerically pure non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;l&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine on a multigram scale. The peptide fragment based methodology is the first convergent &#945;&#8208;amanitin synthesis fully performed in solution phase.







Abstract
The toxic bicyclic octapeptide &#945;&#8208;amanitin is mostly found in different species of the mushroom genus Amanita, with the death cap (Amanita phalloides) as one of the most prominent members. Due to its high selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II, which is directly linked to its high toxicity, particularly to hepatocytes, &#945;&#8208;amanitin received an increased attention as a toxin&#8208;component of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADC) in cancer research. Furthermore, the isolation of &#945;&#8208;amanitin from mushrooms as the sole source severely restricts compound supply as well as further investigations, as structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Based on a straightforward access to the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid dihydroxyisoleucine, we herein present a robust total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amanitin providing options for production at larger scale as well as future structural diversifications.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,12&#8208;Disubstituted [4]Helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Minimalistic helicenes: The use of a chiral gold catalyst bearing an &#945;&#8208;cationic TADDOL&#8208;derived phosphonite as an ancillary ligand allows the enantioselective assembly of 1,12&#8208;disubstituted [4]helicenes&#8212;one of the smallest helical polyarene architectures.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective synthesis of 1,12&#8208;disubstituted [4]carbohelicenes is reported. The key step for the developed synthetic route is a Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation, which is achieved with good to excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity by employing TADDOL&#8208;derived (TADDOL=&#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol) &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonites as ancillary ligands. Moreover, an appropriate design of the substrate makes the assembly of [4]helicenes of different substitution patterns possible, thus demonstrating the synthetic utility of the method. The absolute stereochemistry of the newly prepared structures was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterization of their photophysical properties is also reported.

      <title>Stable Salts of Heteroleptic Iron Carbonyl/Nitrosyl Cations</title>
      <dc:description>
Ready to use&#8230;! Two novel iron carbonyl/nitrosyl cations in the elusive oxidation state +I are now easily accessible as stable salts of the weakly coordinating anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. They may serve as simple model systems for the investigation of the nature of the Fe&#8722;NO bond to further understand the (bio&#8208;)chemistry of iron nitrosyl complexes.







Abstract
The oxidation of Fe(CO)5 with the [NO]+ salt of the weakly coordinating perfluoroalkoxyaluminate anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) leads to stable salts of the 18&#8197;valence electron (VE) species [Fe(CO)4(NO)]+ and [Fe(CO)(NO)3]+ with the Enemark&#8211;Feltham numbers of {FeNO}8 and {FeNO}10. This finally concludes the triad of heteroleptic iron carbonyl/nitrosyl complexes, since the first discovery of the anionic ([Fe(CO)3(NO)]&#8722;) and neutral ([Fe(CO)2(NO)2]) species over 80&#8197;years ago. Both complexes were fully characterized (IR, Raman, NMR, UV/Vis, scXRD, pXRD) and are stable at room temperature under inert conditions over months and may serve as useful starting materials for further investigations.

&lt;p&gt;The oxidation of Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with the [NO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salt of the weakly coordinating perfluoroalkoxyaluminate anion [F&#8208;{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) leads to stable salts of the 18&#8197;valence electron (VE) species [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Fe(CO)(NO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with the Enemark&#8211;Feltham numbers of {FeNO}&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and {FeNO}&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. This finally concludes the triad of heteroleptic iron carbonyl/nitrosyl complexes, since the first discovery of the anionic ([Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and neutral ([Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) species over 80&#8197;years ago. Both complexes were fully characterized (IR, Raman, NMR, UV/Vis, scXRD, pXRD) and are stable at room temperature under inert conditions over months and may serve as useful starting materials for further investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Mapping of Impurities in Partially Reduced Hollow TiO2 Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Impure thoughts: Precise characterization of impurities is critical for understanding and enhancing the functional properties of nanomaterials. The structure&#8211;property relationships of partially reduced hollow TiO2 nanowires are characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Oxygen vacancies and undesired boron, sodium, and nitrogen trace impurities are detected on the surface.







Abstract
The incorporation of impurities during the chemical synthesis of nanomaterials is usually uncontrolled and rarely reported because of the formidable challenge in measuring trace amounts of often light elements with sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution. And yet, these foreign elements (introduced by doping, for example) influence functional properties. We demonstrate how the hydrothermal growth and a partial reduction reaction on hollow TiO2 nanowires leads to the introduction of parts per millions of boron, sodium, and nitrogen. This doping explains the presence of oxygen vacancies and reduced Ti states at the surface, which enhance the functional properties of TiO2. Our results were obtained on model metal oxide nanomaterials and they shed light on a general process that leads to the uncontrolled incorporation of trace impurities in TiO2, thereby, having a strong effect on applications in energy&#8208;harvesting.

      <title>Cooperative Catalysis for the Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective [4+3]&#8208;Cycloannulation of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides and Carbonyl Ylides</title>
      <dc:description>
It takes two: A combination of Rh2(OAc)4 and a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzes the in&#8201;situ generation of transient carbonyl ylides and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonded ortho&#8208;quinone methides through cooperative catalytic cycles. These transient species then undergo a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cycloannulation to afford a broad range of functionalized oxa&#8208;bridged dibenzooxacines featuring two quaternary and one tertiary stereogenic centers.







Abstract
We describe herein a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [4+3]&#8208;cycloannulation of ortho&#8208;quinone methides and carbonyl ylides to furnish functionalized oxa&#8208;bridged dibenzooxacines with excellent yields and stereoselectivity in a single synthetic step. The combination of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalysis working in concert to generate both transient intermediates in&#8197;situ provides direct access to complex bicyclic products with two quaternary and one tertiary stereogenic centers. The products may be further functionalized into valuable and enantiomerically highly enriched building blocks.

      <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro Olefins through C&#8722;H Functionalization and &#946;&#8208;fluoride Elimination Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Putting the F into Functionalization: &#946;&#8208;Fluoro elimination opens up pathways to introduce aryl&#8208;difluorovinyl groups onto indole heterocycles. By using a simple Pd catalyst, gem&#8208;difluoro olefins can now be prepared in a simple and straightforward fashion.







Abstract
A palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and consecutive &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination reaction between indole heterocycles and fluorinated diazoalkanes is reported. This approach provides for the first time a facile method for the rapid synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoro olefins using fluorinated diazoalkanes under mild reaction conditions. Cyclopropanation products were obtained when N&#8208;arylated rather than N&#8208;alkylated indoles were applied in this reaction. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of the &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination step in this transformation. This method presents a new concept for the simple and direct transfer of a 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl) group to access gem&#8208;difluoro olefins.
