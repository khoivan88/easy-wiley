      <title>Coverage&#8208;Controlled Superstructures of&#160;C3&#160;Symmetric Molecules: Honeycomb versus Hexagonal Tiling</title>
      <dc:description>The competition between honeycomb and hexagonal tiling of molecular units can lead to large honeycomb superstructures on surfaces. Such superstructures exhibit pores that may be used as two&#8208;dimensional templates for functional guest molecules. We present honeycomb superstructures of molecules that comprise a&#160; C3&#160; symmetric platform on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. The superstructures cover nearly mesoscopic areas with unit cells containing up to 3000 molecules, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The unit cell size may be controlled via the coverage. We developed a fairly general model that describes the energetics of honeycomb superstructures built from&#160; C3&#160; symmetric units. Based on three parameters that characterize two competing bonding arrangements, the model is consistent with the present experimental results and also reproduces various published results. The model identifies the relevant driving force, mostly related to geometric aspects, of the pattern formation. In turn, the model may be employed to guide the design of molecules for building mesoscopic superstructures.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Bottom&#8208;Side Fluorination of Graphene by 2D&#8208;Substrate Patterning</title>
      <dc:description>Patterned functionalization, which can on the one hand open the bandgap of graphene and on the other hand program demanding designs on graphene, is essential for graphene&#8208;based nano&#8208;architectures. Here, a new and highly efficient method was applied to obtain patterned functionalization on graphene by the mild fluorination with spatially arranged AgF arrays on the structured substrate, which was directly demonstrated by Scanning Raman Spectroscopy (SRS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy (SEM&#8208;EDS). For the first time, chemical patterning on the bottom&#8208;side of graphene was realized. The chemical nature of the patterned functionalization is established to be the ditopic scenario with F&#8208;atoms occupying the bottom&#8208;side and moieties like oxygen&#8208;containing groups or H&#8208;atoms binding on the top&#8208;side, which further discloses the mechanism of the fluorination process. Our novel strategy can be conceptually extended to pattern other functionalities by using other reactants and this bottom&#8208;side patterned functionalization releases lots of possibilities on the top&#8208;side, enabling great potentials for graphene&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Ligand Crosslinking Boosts Thermal Transport in Colloidal Nanocrystal Solids</title>
      <dc:description>The ongoing interest in colloidal nanocrystal solids for electronic and photonic devices necessitates that their thermal transport properties be well understood because heat dissipation frequently limits performance in these devices. Unfortunately, colloidal nanocrystal solids generally possess very low thermal conductivities. This very low thermal conductivity primarily results from the weak van der Waals interaction between the ligands of adjacent nanocrystals. We overcome this thermal transport bottleneck by crosslinking the ligands, which exchanges a weak van der Waals interaction with a strong covalent bond. We obtain thermal conductivities of up to 1.7 Wm  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  that exceed prior reported values by a factor of 4. This improvement is significant because the entire range of prior reported values themselves only span a factor of 4 (i.e., 0.1 &#8211; 0.4 Wm  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  ). We complement our thermal conductivity measurements with mechanical nanoindentation measurements that demonstrate ligand crosslinking increases Young&#8217;s modulus and sound velocity. This increase in sound velocity is a key bridge between mechanical and thermal properties because sound velocity and thermal conductivity are linearly proportional according to kinetic theory. Control experiments with non&#8208;crosslinkable ligands as well as transport modeling further confirm ligand crosslinking boosts thermal transport.</dc:description>

      <title>Modular Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Terpenes and their Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;natural terpenoids have been demonstrated to offer potential as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

The well&#8208;designed DSP electrolyte simultaneously possesses non&#8208;flammability, high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability, and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating. When applied in Li metal batteries with LiMn  2  O  4  cathode, the DSP electrolyte effectively suppresses manganese dissolution from the cathode, and enables high capacity and long lifespan at room and elevated temperatures.</dc:description>

      <title>Clarification of Decomposition Pathways in a State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Lithium Ion Battery Electrolyte through 13C&#8208;Labeling of Electrolyte Components</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermal and electrochemical degradation reactions of a common lithium ion battery electrolyte (ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate + LiPF6) were investigated by using isotope labeling studies. Reaction pathways are postulated as well as a fragmentation mechanism assumption for oligomeric compounds depicted.







Abstract
The decomposition of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium ion battery (LIB) electrolytes leads to a highly complex mixture during battery cell operation. Furthermore, thermal strain by e.g., fast charging can initiate the degradation and generate various compounds. The correlation of electrolyte decomposition products and LIB performance fading over life&#8208;time is mainly unknown. The thermal and electrochemical degradation in electrolytes comprising 1&#8201;m LiPF6 dissolved in 13C3&#8208;labeled ethylene carbonate (EC) and unlabeled diethyl carbonate is investigated and the corresponding reaction pathways are postulated. Furthermore, a fragmentation mechanism assumption for oligomeric compounds is depicted. Soluble decomposition products classes are examined and evaluated with liquid chromatography&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry. This study proposes a formation scheme for oligo phosphates as well as contradictory findings regarding phosphate&#8208;carbonates, disproving monoglycolate methyl/ethyl carbonate as the central reactive species.

Selectively targeting chaotic tumor systems to induce a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; is promising in constructing non&#8208;interventional and effective strategy for tumor therapy.

Integrating of glucose oxidase (GOD) could unlock its oxidase and peroxidase activities by gluconic acid produced by catalysis of GOD towards glucose in cancer cells, and the produced H 2  O 2  can be converted to O 2  to compensate its consumption in GOD catalysis due to the catalase&#8208;like function of the nanozyme, which result in continual consumption of glucose and self&#8208;supplied substrates for generating superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. Moreover, IrO x  can constantly consume glutathione (GSH) by self&#8208;cyclic valence alteration of Ir (IV) and Ir (III), greatly reducing the anti&#8208;oxidation defense effect of tumor. Consequently, these self&#8208;cyclic parallel cascaded reactions due to the introduction of IrO x  &#8208;GOD into chaotic tumor lead to a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of initial starvation therapy and subsequent multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) pressure, completely break the self&#8208;adaption of cancer cells compared to traditional ROS&#8208; and GSH&#8208; targeted therapies, providing new conceptual thinkings for non&#8208;interventional and precise cancer therapy against the resistance.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Conversion and Reaction Mechanism of Propargylic Amines and CO2 Catalyzed by Eco&#8208;Friendly Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free [Zn116] Nanocages</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of propargylic amines and CO  2  can efficiently reduce the release to carbon dioxide&#160;and provide many high value&#8208;added chemical products. Nevertheless most of catalysts in such reaction were associated with noble&#8208;metal to obtain high yield, and it is necessary and important to seek eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs catalysts, but have not been reported so far. Here a giant and lantern&#8208;like [Zn  116  ] nanocage in zinc&#8208;tetrazole 3D framework [Zn  22  (Trz)  8  (OH)  12  (H  2  O)  9  &#183;8H  2  O]  n  Trz = (C  4  N  12  O)  4&#8208;  (  1  ) was obtained and structurally characterized, which is consisted of six [Zn  14  O  21  ] clusters and eight [Zn  4  O  4  ] clusters. To our knowledge, this is the highest nuclearity nanocages constructed by Zn&#8208;clusters as building blocks to date. Importantly, catalytic investigations reveals that  1  can efficiently and circularly catalyze the cycloaddition of propargylic amines with CO  2  , exclusively affording various 2&#8208;oxazolidinones under mild conditions. It is the first eco&#8208;friendly noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs catalyst for the cyclization of propargylic amines with CO  2  , which opens a wide space in accelerating the chemical conversion of CO  2  . The density functional theory (DFT) calculations uncover that Zn(II) ions can efficiently activate both C&#8801;C bonds of propargylic amines and CO  2  by coordination interaction, forming quite short Zn&#8208;O bonds and bent configuration with bond angle of 167.2&#176;. NMR and FTIR spectroscopy further prove that Zn&#8208;clusters play an important role in activating C&#8801;C bonds of propargylic amines. Furthermore, the electronic properties of related reactants, intermediates and products can help to understand the basic reaction mechanism and crucial role of catalyst  1  .</dc:description>

The &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between discrete co&#8208;facially oriented naphthalenediimide (NDI) units in Cyclo&#8208;NDI were modulated by changes in temperature and solvent polarity. As M. Takeuchi et&#8197;al. report in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914414), the tuning of through&#8208;space electronic communication through the conformational transformation between monomer&#8208; and dimer&#8208;like features of Cyclo&#8208;NDI resulted in a highly sensitive and reversible optical response over a wide range of temperatures.

Iron sulfide nanoparticles (FeS NPs) mediate bacterial extracellular electron uptake from solid electron donors. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201915196), A. Okamoto and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that self&#8208;synthesized FeS NPs on the cell surface enable sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria to extract electrons from electrodes coupled with metabolic activation. The result sheds light on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, iron, and sulfur and the anaerobic corrosion mechanism.

Highly selective fluorescent ligands derived from the opium poppy were developed by D. Calebiro, M. Decker et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201912683) to investigate whether &#956;&#8208;opioid receptors (&#956;&#8208;ORs) can form dimers on the plasma membrane. These compounds exhibit long residence time and high affinity. Applying these chemical tools, single&#8208;molecule microscopy allowed detection of a small fraction of short&#8208;lived homodimers.

      <dc:description>
Space&#8208;confined polymerization to prepare gas molecular&#8208;sieving membranes is described by B. Wang et al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913360). CMP@PSU membranes were prepared by partitioning the mesoscopic channels in a water ultrafiltration membrane (PSU) into ultramicropores through space&#8208;confined polymerization of multifunctionalized rigid building units. Remarkable H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation performances, outstanding long&#8208;term stability, and aging resistance were achieved.

Biomimetic strain&#8208;stiffening supramolecular hydrogels were prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of molecular gelators, as shown by J.&#8197;H. van&#8197;Esch and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201911364).

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Activation at Metal Centers: Evolution of Charge Transfer from Mg+ to CO2 in [MgCO2(H2O)n]+, n = 0&#8211;8</title>
      <dc:description>We investigate activation of carbon dioxide by singly charged hydrated magnesium cations Mg&#8226;+(H2O)n, through infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The spectra of [MgCO2(H2O)n]&#8226;+ in the 1250&#8211;4000 cm&#8211;1 region show a sharp transition from n&#160;=&#160;2 to n&#160;=&#160;3 for the position of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode. This is evidence for the activation of CO2 via charge transfer from Mg&#8226;+ to CO2 for n &#8805; 3, while smaller clusters feature linear CO2 coordinated end&#8208;on to the metal center. Starting with n&#160;=&#160;5, we see a further conformational change, with CO2&#8226;&#8211; coordination to Mg2+ gradually shifting from bidentate to monodentate, consistent with preferential hexa&#8208;coordination of Mg2+.

      <title>Bacterial Autoimmune Drug Metabolism Transforms an Immunomodulator into Structurally and Functionally Divergent Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>The stilbene tapinarof is a drug used to treat psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

      <title>Synthesis of novel small&#8208;molecule fluorescently labeled probes for the in vitro imaging of KCa3.1 channels</title>
      <dc:description>In order to facilitate the  in vitro  visualization of K  Ca  3.1 channel&#8208;expressing cells, novel small&#8208;molecule imaging probes were designed and developed. Senicapoc showing high affinity and excellent selectivity towards the K  Ca  3.1 channels was selected as targeting component. Different BODIPY dyes (  15  &#8208;  20  ) were synthesized and connected by a Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne [3+2]cycloaddition with propargyl ether derivative  8  of senicapoc yielding fluorescently labeled ligands  21  &#8208;  26  targeting K  Ca  3.1 channels. The novel dimethylpyrrole&#8208;based imaging probes  25  and  26  allow staining of K  Ca  3.1 ion channels in NSCLC cells following a simple, fast and efficient protocol. The specificity was shown by removing the punctate staining pattern by pre&#8208;incubation with senicapoc. The density of K  Ca  3.1 channels detected with fluorescent probe  25  and by immunostaining was identical. The punctate structure of the labeled channels could be observed in living cells as well. Molecular modeling studies showed binding of the senicapoc targeting component towards the binding site within the ion channel and orientation of the linker with the dye along the inner surface of the ion channel.</dc:description>

      <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA Functionalization of Upconversion Nanoparticles and Their Programmable Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>DNA&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (DNA&#8208;UCNPs) that combine DNA&#8217;s function and optical feature of UCNPs together have shown great promise in the fields of new material design, photonic devices, bioimaging, and disease treatment. However, challenges remain in precisely tethering and orientating the DNA strands on UCNP surface. Herein, we systematically investigate the sequence dependence of DNAs in their interactions with UCNPs, and reveal that poly&#8208;cytosine (poly&#8208;C) has specifically high affinity to UCNP surface. Based on this discovery, we develop a general approach to synthesize monodispersed DNA&#8208;UCNP conjugates using poly&#8208;C containing &#8220;diblock&#8221; DNA strands. High binding affinity of poly&#8208;C segment enables its competitive and firm tethering on the surfaces of UCNPs with different sizes, shapes, and luminescence. Consequently, the second block of used DNA strands with lower affinity would tightly and perpendicularly orientate on UCNP surface, making the DNA&#8208;UCNPs highly stable and monodispersed in aqueous solution. With complementary designed sequences, the dense layer of extruding DNA segments on UCNP surface allows the particles programmably assemble with other DNA&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles or DNA origamis through hybridizations, resulting in the formation of well&#8208;organized complex structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Water Triggers Hydrogen Bond Network Reshaping in the Glycoaldehyde Dimer</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrates are ubiquitous biomolecules in nature. The vast majority of their biomolecular activity takes place in aqueous environments.

      <title>Difunctionalization of Alkenes Involving Metal Migration</title>
      <dc:description>
Driving force: The difunctionalization of alkenes involving metal migration provides access a new class of products that are not readily synthesized by other methods. This review summarizes recent advances in the field, with an emphasis on the driving force for metal migration.







Abstract
The direct difunctionalization of alkenes, a cheap and abundant feedstock, represents one of the most attractive strategies for increasing molecular complexity in synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast with the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, recent advances showcase alkene 1,n&#8208;difunctionalizations (n&#8800;2) involving metal migration is an emerging and rapidly growing area of research. This promising strategy not only opens a novel avenue for future development of alkene transformations, but also significantly expands upon the bond disconnections available in modern organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the migratory difunctionalization of alkenes, with an emphasis on the driving force for metal migration.

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Hierarchical Hollow CoP@C Composites with Superior Performance for Sodium and Potassium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical hollow CoP and carbon composites were obtained through a facile one&#8208;step synthesis. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of conductive carbon layer and hierarchical hollow structure, the as&#8208;prepared CoP@C composites demonstrate superior sodium and potassium storage capability as anode materials for rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Hierarchical hollow CoP and carbon composites were obtained through a facile synthetic method, where carbonization and phosphorization of the precursor were completed within one single step. The composites are composed of hollow CoP@C spheres, which are further made up of CoP nanoparticles with a thin outer carbon layer. Electrochemical performances of the prepared CoP@C composites as anodes for sodium and potassium storage were evaluated and compared. In&#8197;situ TEM, in&#8197;situ synchrotron XRD, and DFT calculations were conducted to study the structural evolution and the interaction between Na/K and CoP during cycling processes. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of conductive carbon layer and hierarchical hollow structure, the as&#8208;prepared CoP@C composites demonstrate superior sodium and potassium storage capability as anode materials for rechargeable batteries.

Axially chiral styrenes were constructed through a PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination with a bulky amino amide as a transient chiral auxiliary. Various axially chiral styrenes were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivity.

The atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral styrenes remains a formidable challenge due to their relatively lower rotational barriers compared to the biaryl atropoisomers. Herein, we describe the construction of axially chiral styrenes through PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination, using a bulky amino amide as a transient chiral auxiliary. Various axially chiral styrenes were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). Carboxylic acid derivatives of the resulting axially chiral styrenes showed superior enantiocontrol over the biaryl counterparts in CoIII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of thioamide. Mechanistic studies suggest that C&#8722;H cleavage is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

      <title>Amide Synthesis by Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Carbamoylation of (Hetero)Aryl Bromides</title>
      <dc:description>
Teaming up for amide synthesis: A catalytic method for amide synthesis is detailed that proceeds at ambient temperature and enables the direct carbamoylation of (hetero)aryl bromides. This method is based on the combination of nickel and photoredox catalysis and uses readily available dihydropyridines as precursors of carbamoyl radicals.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;electron strategy for catalytic amide synthesis that enables the direct carbamoylation of (hetero)aryl bromides. This radical cross&#8208;coupling approach, which is based on the combination of nickel and photoredox catalysis, proceeds at ambient temperature and uses readily available dihydropyridines as precursors of carbamoyl radicals. The method's mild reaction conditions make it tolerant of sensitive&#8208;functional&#8208;group&#8208;containing substrates and allow the installation of an amide scaffold within biologically relevant heterocycles. In addition, we installed amide functionalities bearing electron&#8208;poor and sterically hindered amine moieties, which would be difficult to prepare with classical dehydrative condensation methods.

      <title>Fabrication of Microporous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks in Uninterrupted Mesoporous Tunnels: Hierarchical Structure for Efficient Trypsin Immobilization and Stabilization</title>
      <dc:description>
Hierarchical structures were constructed using microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in uninterrupted mesoporous tunnels. Highly dispersed metal precursors are coated on the internal surface of mesoporous tunnels, followed by ligand vapor&#8208;induced crystallization to form MOFs. The obtained composites shows high adsorption capacity for trypsin.







Abstract
Hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) are promising in various applications. Most reported HP&#8208;MOFs are prepared based on the generation of mesopores in microporous frameworks, and the formed mesopores are connected by microporous channels, limiting the accessibility of mesopores for bulky molecules. A hierarchical structure is formed by constructing microporous MOFs in uninterrupted mesoporous tunnels. Using the confined space in as&#8208;prepared mesoporous silica, highly dispersed metal precursors for MOFs are coated on the internal surface of mesoporous tunnels. Ligand vapor&#8208;induced crystallization is employed to enable quantitative formation of MOFs in&#8197;situ, in which sublimated ligands diffuse into mesoporous tunnels and react with metal precursors. The obtained hierarchically porous composites exhibit record&#8208;high adsorption capacity for the bulky molecule trypsin. The thermal and storage stability of trypsin is improved upon immobilization on the composites.

      <title>Trackable Supramolecular Fusion: Cage to Cage Transformation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Metalloassemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
A Pt in a cage: Inspired by natural systems, the trackable supramolecular platinum(II) cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is presented. It takes advantage of programmable metal coordination chemistry as well as unique photophysical properties of AIE&#8208;active metalloassemblies.







Abstract
Herein, the trackable supramolecular transformation of a two&#8208;component molecular cage to a three&#8208;component cage through supramolecular fusion with another two&#8208;component molecular square is described. The use of tetraphenylethene (TPE), a chromophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, as a component for the molecular cages enables facile fluorescence monitoring of the transformation process: while both cages exhibit fluorescence emission via the restriction of intramolecular motion of the TPE motif, the interactions between TPE and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine introduced in the supramolecular fusion process result in partial fluorescence quenching and shifts in the emission maximum. This study provides a simple and efficient approach towards complex supramolecular cages with emergent functions and demonstrates that AIE features could provide unique opportunities for the characterization of complex, dynamic supramolecular transformation processes.

Abstract
The first alkali&#8208;metal vanadium iodate fluoride, CsVO2F(IO3), with a novel 3D anionic framework, has been rationally designed and hydrothermally synthesized.

      <title>The Structure of Water Bonded to Phosphate Groups at the Electrified Zwitterionic Phospholipid Membranes/Aqueous Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
By virtue of double disturbance of applied potentials and added ions, it is clearly revealed that the strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water in the vicinity of the phosphate groups can resist the disturbance of potentials. The removal of such a strongly H&#8208;bonded water structure has a dramatic influence on the electrostatic properties of the phospholipid membranes.







Abstract
Gaining insight into the water structure at the electrified phospholipid membranes/aqueous interface is vital and essential for elucidating the mechanism of many biochemical reactions, but still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, based on the superiority of surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy combined with electrochemistry in interfacial analysis, the evolution of local water structure at the zwitterionic phospholipid membranes/aqueous interface with an external electric field is revealed by means of ion perturbation. The strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water directly bonded to the phosphate groups (PO2&#8722;) has a strong mechanical strength to resist potential perturbations, and that portion of water greatly affects the electrostatic properties of the phospholipid membranes. This study innovates the basic understanding of electric double layer (EDL) at the membranes/aqueous interface.

The strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water directly bonded to the phosphate groups (PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) has a strong mechanical strength to resist potential perturbations, and that portion of water greatly affects the electrostatic properties of the phospholipid membranes. This study innovates the basic understanding of electric double layer (EDL) at the membranes/aqueous interface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toughening a Self&#8208;Healable Supramolecular Polymer by Ionic Cluster&#8208;Enhanced Iron&#8208;Carboxylate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;density iron&#8208;carboxylate ionic clusters can remarkably toughen a dry supramolecular network by forming high&#8208;affinity secondary ionic clusters. The toughened network exhibits high mechanical strength, high stretchability, efficient self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers that can heal themselves automatically usually exhibit weakness in mechanical toughness and stretchability. Here we exploit a toughening strategy for a dynamic dry supramolecular network by introducing ionic cluster&#8208;enhanced iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes. The resulting dry supramolecular network simultaneous exhibits tough mechanical strength, high stretchability, self&#8208;healing ability, and processability at room temperature. The excellent performance of these distinct supramolecular polymers is attributed to the hierarchical existence of four types of dynamic combinations in the high&#8208;density dry network, including dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, noncovalent H&#8208;bonds, iron&#8208;carboxylate complexes and ionic clustering interactions. The extremely facile preparation method of this self&#8208;healing polymer offers prospects for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost material among others for coatings and wearable devices.

      <title>Rational Design of an Iron&#8208;Based Catalyst for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Couplings Involving Heteroaromatic Boronic Esters and Tertiary Alkyl Electrophiles</title>

Nacnac! Who's there? A mechanistically driven approach to Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with an iron&#8208;based catalyst enables the facile construction of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds with heteroaromatic boronic esters. Additional advancements allow for the construction of all carbon quaternary centers with no observable isomerization.







Abstract
Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions between a variety of alkyl halides and unactivated aryl boronic esters using a rationally designed iron&#8208;based catalyst supported by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands are described. High catalyst activity resulted in a broad substrate scope that included tertiary alkyl halides and heteroaromatic boronic esters. Mechanistic experiments revealed that the iron&#8208;based catalyst benefited from the propensity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands to support low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing iron amide intermediates, which are very efficient for effecting the transmetalation step required for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.

      <title>Drug Screening in Human Cells by NMR Spectroscopy Allows the Early Assessment of Drug Potency</title>
      <dc:description>
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is used for drug screening in human cells. The approach is demonstrated by screening candidate drugs against intracellular carbonic anhydrase&#8197;2. The method allows the determination of drug permeability and intracellular binding specificity, which are related to drug potency, at an early stage of drug development and without recurring to enzymatic assays.







Abstract
Structure&#8208;based drug development is often hampered by the lack of in&#8197;vivo activity of promising compounds screened in&#8197;vitro, due to low membrane permeability or poor intracellular binding selectivity. Herein, we show that ligand screening can be performed in living human cells by &#8220;intracellular protein&#8208;observed&#8221; NMR spectroscopy, without requiring enzymatic activity measurements or other cellular assays. Quantitative binding information is obtained by fast, inexpensive 1H&#8197;NMR experiments, providing intracellular dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent ligand binding curves, from which kinetic and thermodynamic parameters linked to cell permeability and binding affinity and selectivity are obtained. The approach was applied to carbonic anhydrase and, in principle, can be extended to any NMR&#8208;observable intracellular target. The results obtained are directly related to the potency of candidate drugs, that is, the required dose. The application of this approach at an early stage of the drug design pipeline could greatly increase the low success rate of modern drug development.

      <dc:description>Severe side effects and poor therapeutic efficacy are the main drawbacks of current anticancer drugs. These problems can be mitigated by targeting, but the targeting efficacy of current drugs is poor and urgently needs improvement. Taking this into consideration, this review first summarizes the current targeting strategies for cancer therapy in terms of cancer tissue and organelles. Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented.

      <title>Manipulating Layered P2@P3 Integrated Spinel Structure Evolution for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
      <dc:description>As for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, the structure evolution during cycling plays a vital role in their electrochemical performance. Herein, through a strategy for engineering the crystal structure coupled with chemical element substitution, we design a layered P2@P3 integrated spinel Na  0.5  Ni  0.1  Co  0.15  Mn  0.65  Mg  0.1  O  2  oxide cathode. This novel electrode shows excellent sodium&#8208;ion half/full battery performance due to the synergistic effects of its triphase intergrowth structure and cation substitution strategy. Based on combined analyses by scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution, as well as  ex&#8208;situ  synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and  in&#8208;situ  synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition are clearly articulated and confirmed. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in this special structure and opens up a novel field via manipulating structural evolution for the design of high&#8208;performance battery cathodes.</dc:description>

Herein, through a strategy for engineering the crystal structure coupled with chemical element substitution, we design a layered P2@P3 integrated spinel Na  0.5  Ni  0.1  Co  0.15  Mn  0.65  Mg  0.1  O  2  oxide cathode. This novel electrode shows excellent sodium&#8208;ion half/full battery performance due to the synergistic effects of its triphase intergrowth structure and cation substitution strategy. Based on combined analyses by scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution, as well as  ex&#8208;situ  synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and  in&#8208;situ  synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition are clearly articulated and confirmed. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in this special structure and opens up a novel field via manipulating structural evolution for the design of high&#8208;performance battery cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A direct fluorescent activity assay for glycosyltransferases enables convenient high&#8208;throughput screening: Application to O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase</title>
      <dc:description>Glycosyltransferases carry out important cellular functions in species ranging from bacteria to humans. Despite their essential roles in biology, simple and robust activity assays that can be easily applied to high&#8208;throughput screening for inhibitors of these enzymes have been challenging to develop. Here we report a bead&#8208;based strategy to sensitively measure the group transfer activity of glycosyltransferases using simple fluorescence measurements, without the need for coupled enzymes or secondary reactions. We validate the performance and accuracy of the assay using  O  &#8208;GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) as a model system through detailed Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetic analysis of various substrates and inhibitors. Optimization of this assay and application to high&#8208;throughput screening enabled screening for inhibitors of OGT, leading to a novel inhibitory scaffold. We believe this assay will prove valuable not only for the study of OGT, but also more widely as a general approach for the screening of glycosyltransferases and other group transfer enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Benchtop Method for Appending Protic Functional Groups to N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Protected Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>The remarkable resilience of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) gold bonds has quickly made NHCs the ligand of choice when functionalizing gold surfaces. Despite rapid progress using deposition from free or CO  2  &#8208;protected NHCs, synthetic challenges hinder the functionalization of NHC surfaces with protic functional groups, such as alcohols and amines, particularly on larger nanoparticles. Here, we synthesize NHC&#8208;functionalized gold surfaces from gold(I) NHC complexes and aqueous nanoparticles without the need for additional reagents, enabling otherwise difficult functional groups to be appended to the carbene. The resilience of the NHC&#8208;Au bond allows for multi&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. Beginning with the nitro&#8208;NHC, we form an amine&#8208;NHC terminated surface, which further undergoes amide coupling with carboxylic acids. The simplicity of this approach, its compatibility with aqueous nanoparticle solutions, and its ability to yield protic functionality, greatly expands the potential of NHC&#8208;functionalized noble metal surfaces.</dc:description>

Abstract
Bifunctional nanocrystals with integrated plasmonic and catalytic activities hold great promise for analyzing chemical reactions by in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This Minireview gives a brief introduction to the general strategies for designing such nanocrystals, followed by four typical examples, including their fabrication, characterization, and potential limitation. We then use the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrothiophenol and oxidation of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol as two model systems to demonstrate the capabilities of these bifunctional nanocrystals to monitor chemical reactions for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms and measurement of kinetics. We conclude with perspectives on further development of these bifunctional nanocrystals into a viable platform for investigating other types of catalytic reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Bifunctional nanocrystals with integrated plasmonic and catalytic activities hold great promise for analyzing chemical reactions by in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This Minireview gives a brief introduction to the general strategies for designing such nanocrystals, followed by four typical examples, including their fabrication, characterization, and potential limitation. We then use the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrothiophenol and oxidation of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol as two model systems to demonstrate the capabilities of these bifunctional nanocrystals to monitor chemical reactions for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms and measurement of kinetics. We conclude with perspectives on further development of these bifunctional nanocrystals into a viable platform for investigating other types of catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supramolecular Photothermal Effects: A Promising Mechanism for Efficient Thermal Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Bring the heat! Supramolecular assemblies provide an elegant way to fabricate organic photothermal materials with enhanced stability and photothermal conversion efficiency, which can be termed supramolecular photothermal effects. By elaborating the inherent mechanisms, the supramolecular photothermal effects are expected to greatly benefit the design of novel high&#8208;efficiency photothermal materials and their applications in a variety of fields.







Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies have been very successful in regulating the photothermal conversion efficiency of organic photothermal materials in a simple and flexible way, compared with conventional molecular synthesis. In these assemblies, it is the inherent physiochemical mechanism that determines the photothermal conversion, rather than the assembly strategy. This Minireview summarizes supramolecular photothermal effects, which refer to the unique features of supramolecular chemistry for regulating the photothermal conversion efficiency. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of how self&#8208;assembly affects the photothermal performance. The supramolecular photothermal effects on various types of light&#8208;harvesting species are discussed in detail. The timely interpretation of supramolecular photothermal effects is promising for the future design of the photothermal materials with high efficiency, precision, and multiple functionalities for a wide array of applications.

      <title>Strategies towards Low&#8208;Cost Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Beyond conventional batteries: This Review presents the development history and state of the art of DIBs and presents the reaction kinetics and corresponding critical issues including the various anionic intercalation mechanisms of cathodes, and the reactions at the anodes, including intercalation and alloying, to explore promising strategies towards low&#8208;cost DIBs with high performance.







Abstract
Rocking&#8208;chair based lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have extensively applied to consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) for solving the present worldwide issues of fossil fuel exhaustion and environmental pollution. However, due to the growing unprecedented demand of LIBs for commercialization in EVs and grid&#8208;scale energy storage stations, and a shortage of lithium and cobalt, the increasing cost gives impetus to exploit low&#8208;cost rechargeable battery systems. Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs), in which both cations and anions are involved in the electrochemical redox reaction, are one of the most promising candidates to meet the low&#8208;cost requirements of commercial applications, because of their high working voltage, excellent safety, and environmental friendliness compared to conventional rocking&#8208;chair based LIBs. However, DIB technologies are only at the stage of fundamental research and considerable effort is required to improve the energy density and cycle life further. We review the development history and current situation, and discuss the reaction kinetics involved in DIBs, including various anionic intercalation mechanism of cathodes, and the reactions at the anodes including intercalation and alloying to explore promising strategies towards low&#8208;cost DIBs with high performance.

      <title>Persistent Borafluorene Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystalline, isolable borafluorene radicals that are stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene or cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ligands have been synthesized. They exhibit remarkable solution and solid&#8208;state stability and were characterized by elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV/Vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy, and theoretical studies.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208; and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borafluorene radicals have been isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV/Vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and theoretical studies. Both the CAAC&#8211;borafluorene radical (2) and the NHC&#8211;borafluorene radical (4) have a considerable amount of spin density localized on the boron atoms (0.322 for 2 and 0.369 for 4). In compound 2, the unpaired electron is also partly delocalized over the CAAC ligand carbeneC and N atoms. However, the unpaired electron in compound 4 mainly resides throughout the borafluorene &#960;&#8208;system, with significantly less delocalization over the NHC ligand. These results highlight the Lewis base dependent electrostructural tuning of materials&#8208;relevant radicals. Notably, this is the first report of crystalline borafluorene radicals, and these species exhibit remarkable solid&#8208;state and solution stability.

      <title>Crystalline BP&#8208;Doped Phenanthryne via Photolysis of The Elusive Boraphosphaketene</title>
      <dc:description>
P brings stability: The first BP&#8208;doped phenanthryne has been synthesized via photolysis of the elusive boraphosphaketene. While BN&#8208;doped phenanthryne was previously discussed as a reactive intermediate that could not be isolated, the heavier BP&#8208;doped analogue exhibits remarkable solution and solid&#8208;state stability.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity study of the first isolable boraphosphaketene, cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (CAAC)&#8208;borafluorene&#8208;P=C=O (2), is described. Photolysis of compound 2 results in the formation of CAAC&#8208;stabilized BP&#8208;doped phenanthryne (3) through tandem decarbonylation, monoatomic phosphide insertion, and ring&#8208;expansion. Notably, while BN&#8208;doped phenanthryne was previously discussed as a reactive intermediate which could not be isolated, the heavier BP&#8208;doped analogue exhibits remarkable solution and solid&#8208;state stability. The reactivity of 2 with stable carbenes was also explored. Addition of CAAC to 2 led to migration of the original CAAC ligand from boron to phosphorus and coordination of the added CAAC to carbon, affording compound 4. Reaction of 1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (NHC) with 2 resulted in N&#8722;C bond activation to give the unusual spiro&#8208;heterocyclic compound (5).

      <title>1,3&#8208;Difunctionalizations of [1.1.1]Propellane via 1,2&#8208;Metallate Rearrangements of Boronate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) has been achieved through multicomponent couplings between organometallic reagents, [1.1.1]propellane, and organoboronic esters. By utilizing the versatile 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement chemistry of boronate complexes generated in&#8197;situ, a range of C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions could be performed without the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are valuable bioisosteres of para&#8208;substituted aromatic rings. The most direct route to these structures is via multicomponent ring&#8208;opening reactions of [1.1.1]propellane. However, challenges associated with these transformations mean that difunctionalized BCPs are more commonly prepared by multistep reaction sequences with BCP&#8208;halide intermediates. Herein, we report three&#8208; and four&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;difunctionalizations of [1.1.1]propellane with organometallic reagents, organoboronic esters, and a variety of electrophiles. This process is achieved by trapping intermediate BCP&#8208;metal species with boronic esters to form boronate complexes, which are versatile intermediates whose electrophile&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement chemistry enables a broad range of C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A modular synthesis&lt;/b&gt; of 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) has been achieved through multicomponent couplings between organometallic reagents, [1.1.1]propellane, and organoboronic esters. By utilizing the versatile 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement chemistry of boronate complexes generated in&#8197;situ, a range of C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions could be performed without the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,3&#8208;Disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are valuable bioisosteres of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted aromatic rings. The most direct route to these structures is via multicomponent ring&#8208;opening reactions of [1.1.1]propellane. However, challenges associated with these transformations mean that difunctionalized BCPs are more commonly prepared by multistep reaction sequences with BCP&#8208;halide intermediates. Herein, we report three&#8208; and four&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;difunctionalizations of [1.1.1]propellane with organometallic reagents, organoboronic esters, and a variety of electrophiles. This process is achieved by trapping intermediate BCP&#8208;metal species with boronic esters to form boronate complexes, which are versatile intermediates whose electrophile&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement chemistry enables a broad range of C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermolecular Carbonyl&#8211;olefin Metathesis with Vinyl Ethers Catalyzed by Homogeneous and Solid Acids in Flow</title>
      <dc:description>
Intermolecular carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis between aromatic ketones/aldehydes and vinyl ethers is accomplished with not only simple soluble but also solid acid catalysts to give trans alkenes in high yields and multigram amounts in&#8208;flow.







Abstract
The carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis reaction has experienced significant advances in the last seven years with new catalysts and reaction protocols. However, most of these procedures involve soluble catalysts for intramolecular reactions in batch. Herein, we show that recoverable, inexpensive, easy to handle, non&#8208;toxic, and widely available simple solid acids, such as the aluminosilicate montmorillonite, can catalyze the intermolecular carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis of aromatic ketones and aldehydes with vinyl ethers in&#8208;flow, to give alkenes with complete trans stereoselectivity on multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. Experimental and computational data support a mechanism based on a carbocation&#8208;induced Grob fragmentation. These results open the way for the industrial implementation of carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis over solid catalysts in continuous mode, which is still the origin and main application of the parent alkene&#8211;alkene cross&#8208;metathesis.

This Minireview summarizes the recent developments of TTA&#8208;UC switching by external stimuli such as temperature, oxygen, chemicals, light, electric field, and mechanical force. For the systematic understanding of the underlying general mechanisms, the switching mechanisms are categorized into 4 types: 1) aggregation&#8208;induced UC; 2) assembly&#8208;induced air&#8208;stable UC; 3) diffusion&#8208;controlled UC and 4) energy transfer&#8208;controlled UC. The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive smart TTA&#8208;UC systems would enable the sensing with unprecedented sensitivity and selectivity, and expand the scope of TTA&#8208;UC photochemistry by its cross&#8208;fertilization with supramolecular chemistry, materials chemistry, mechanochemistry, and biochemistry.</dc:description>

DFT analysis of bonding patterns in the Ba&#8208;stannylide and Ba&#8208;silanylide highlights a prevailingly ionic Ba&#8208;to&#8208;tetrelide bond with a small covalent contribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Biocompatible and pH&#8208;Responsive Colloidal Surfactants with Tunable Shape for Controlled Interfacial Curvature</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular surfactant&#8208;stabilized emulsions are susceptible to coalescence and Ostwald ripening. Amphiphilic particles, which have a much stronger anchoring strength at the interface, could effectively alleviate the problems, forming stable Pickering emulsions. Here, we develop a versatile method to fabricate biocompatible amphiphilic dimer particles via controlled co&#8208;precipitation and phase separation. The dimer particles consist of a hydrophobic PLA bulb and a hydrophilic shellac&#8208;PEG bulb, resembling nonionic molecular surfactants. The size and diameter ratio of the dimer particles are easily tunable, giving a flexible control over the water/oil interfacial curvature and thus the type of emulsions. The particle&#8208;stabilized emulsions are stable for a long period of time and could be destabilized through a pH&#8208;triggered response. The biocompatible amphiphilic dimer particles with tunable morphology and functionality are thus ideal colloidal surfactants for various applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular surfactant&#8208;stabilized emulsions are susceptible to coalescence and Ostwald ripening. Amphiphilic particles, which have a much stronger anchoring strength at the interface, could effectively alleviate the problems, forming stable Pickering emulsions. Here, we develop a versatile method to fabricate biocompatible amphiphilic dimer particles via controlled co&#8208;precipitation and phase separation. The dimer particles consist of a hydrophobic PLA bulb and a hydrophilic shellac&#8208;PEG bulb, resembling nonionic molecular surfactants. The size and diameter ratio of the dimer particles are easily tunable, giving a flexible control over the water/oil interfacial curvature and thus the type of emulsions. The particle&#8208;stabilized emulsions are stable for a long period of time and could be destabilized through a pH&#8208;triggered response. The biocompatible amphiphilic dimer particles with tunable morphology and functionality are thus ideal colloidal surfactants for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Hybrid Membrane with High On/Off Photoswitchable Proton Conductivity</title>
      <dc:description>Mimicking of the biological proton pumps to achieve stimuli&#8208;responsive protonic solids has long been of great interest for their diverse applications in fuel cells, chemical sensors and bio&#8208;electronic devices; but establishing simple, feasible synthetic strategies and developing the proton transporting materials for smart devices remains a great challenge. Herein we demonstrate that dynamic light&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;organic framework hybrid membranes can be obtained by in&#8208;situ encapsulation of photoactive molecules (sulfonated spiropyran, SSP), as the molecular valve, into the cavities of the host ZIF&#8208;8. The configuration of SSP can be changed and switched reversibly in response to the light, generating different mobile acidic protons and thus high on/off photoswitchable proton conductivity in the resulting hybrid membranes and devices. The fabricated hybrid membrane device exhibits a high proton conductivity, fast response time and extremely large on/off ratio upon visible light irradiation.

      <title>Metal&#8208;like ductility in organic plastic crystals: Role of molecular shape and dihydrogen bonding interactions in aminoboranes</title>
      <dc:description>Ductility, which is a common phenomenon in many metals, is hard to achieve in molecular crystals. Organic crystals have been recently shown to bend plastically on one or two face specific directions, but they fracture when stressed in any other arbitrary directions. Here, we report an exceptional metal&#8208;like ductility and malleability in crystals of two globular molecules, BH  3  NMe  3  and BF  3  NMe  3  , with characteristic tensile stretching, compression, twisting and thinning (increase of width over 500%). Surprisingly, the mechanically deformed samples, which transition to lower symmetry phases, not only retain good long range order, but also allow structure determination by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Molecules in these high symmetry crystals interact predominantly  via  electrostatic forces (B  &#8211;  &#8211;N  +  ) and form columnar structures, thus forming multiple slip planes with weak dispersive forces among columns. While the former interactions hold molecules together, the latter facilitate exceptional ductility. On the other hand, the limited number of facile slip planes and strong dihydrogen bonding in BH  3  NHMe  2  negates ductility. The understanding gained in the aminoboranes with exceptional ductility and ability to retain crystalline order may enable designing highly modular, easy&#8208;to&#8208;cast crystalline functional organics, for applications in ferroelectrics, barocalorimetry and soft&#8208;robotics.</dc:description>

      <title>Modular synthesis of nonadecasaccharide motif from Psidium guajava polysaccharides with potent antidiabetic activity through orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrates are important biomolecules with numerous crucial roles in a variety of biological processes. Due to the issues of microheterogeneity, isolation of pure and sufficient amounts of glycans from nature is a formidable task. Chemical synthesis is an efficient and scalable method to obtain well&#8208;defined and pure glycans for developing therapeutic agents and deciphering their functions. So far, synthesis of long, branched and complex carbohydrate sequences remains one of the most challenging tasks in chemical synthesis. Here, we report an efficient modular one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonadecasaccharide and shorter sequences from  Psidium guajava  polysaccharide with potent a&#8208;glucosidase inhibitory activity. Our synthetic strategies have the following features: (1) several one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions on the basis of PTFAI glycosylation and Yu glycosylation to streamline the chemical synthesis of oligosaccharides, (2) the successful and efficient assembly sequences (first O&#8208;3&#8217;, second O&#8208;5&#8217;, final O&#8208;2&#8217;) toward the challenging 2, 3, 5&#8208;branched Ara  f  motif, (3) the stereoselective 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glucosylation by reagent control, and (4) the convergent [6 + 6 + 7] one&#8208;pot coupling reaction for the final assembly of the target nonadecasaccharide.

      <title>Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline) Based Functional Mimics of Peptides to Eradicate MRSA Infections and Persisters While Alleviating Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
      <dc:description>Peptides have important biological functions. However, peptides&#8217; susceptibility to proteolysis is a big hurdle to their application. We demonstrated, for the first time, that poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) can work as functional mimics of peptides. Using host defense peptide as a model, we showed poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) based glycine pseudopeptides can mimic host defense peptide and have potent  in vitro  and  in vivo  activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  that cause formidable infections. The poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) showed potent activity against persister cells that are highly resistant to antibiotics. S  taphylococcus aureus  were unable to acquire resistance upon poly(2&#8208;oxazoline), owning to the reactive oxygen species related antimicrobial mechanism. Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) treated  Staphylococcus aureus  were still sensitive to common antibiotics, demonstrating no observable antimicrobial pressure or cross&#8208;resistance in using antimicrobial poly(2&#8208;oxazoline). Our study highlighted poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) as a new type of functional mimics of peptides and opened up new avenues in designing and exploring peptide mimetics for biological functions and applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peptides have important biological functions. However, peptides&#8217; susceptibility to proteolysis is a big hurdle to their application. We demonstrated, for the first time, that poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) can work as functional mimics of peptides. Using host defense peptide as a model, we showed poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) based glycine pseudopeptides can mimic host defense peptide and have potent  in vitro  and  in vivo  activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  that cause formidable infections. The poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) showed potent activity against persister cells that are highly resistant to antibiotics. S  taphylococcus aureus  were unable to acquire resistance upon poly(2&#8208;oxazoline), owning to the reactive oxygen species related antimicrobial mechanism. Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) treated  Staphylococcus aureus  were still sensitive to common antibiotics, demonstrating no observable antimicrobial pressure or cross&#8208;resistance in using antimicrobial poly(2&#8208;oxazoline). Our study highlighted poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) as a new type of functional mimics of peptides and opened up new avenues in designing and exploring peptide mimetics for biological functions and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Genomic encryption of digital data stored in synthetic DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Today, we can read human genomes and store digital data robustly in synthetic DNA. Here we report a strategy to intertwine these two technologies to enable the secure storage of valuable information in synthetic DNA, protected with personalized keys. We show that genetic short tandem repeats (STRs) contain sufficient entropy to generate strong encryption keys, and that only one technology, DNA sequencing, is required to simultaneously read key and data. Using this approach, we experimentally generated 80 bit strong keys from human DNA, and used such a key to encrypt 17kB of digital information stored in synthetic DNA. Finally, the decrypted information was recovered perfectly from a single massively parallel sequencing run.</dc:description>

      <title>Closing the loop for hydrogen storage: Facile regeneration of NaBH4 from its hydrolytic product</title>
      <dc:description>Sodium borohydride (NaBH4  ) is among the most studied hydrogen storage materials since it is able to deliver high purity H2  at room temperature with controllable kinetics via hydrolysis, but its regeneration from the hydrolytic product has been challenging. Herein we report a facile method to regenerate NaBH4  with high yield and low costs. The hydrolytic product NaBO2  in aqueous solution reacts with CO2  forming Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O and Na2CO3  , both of which are ball milled with Mg under ambient conditions to form NaBH4  with a high yield close to 80%. Compared with previous studies, this new approach avoids expensive reducing agent such as MgH2  , bypasses the energy&#8208;intensive dehydration procedure to remove water from Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O, and does not require&#160;high&#8208;pressure H2  gas, therefore leading to much reduced costs. This method is expected to effectively close the loop of NaBH4  regeneration and hydrolysis, enabling a wide deployment of NaBH4  for hydrogen storage.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Direct construction of supramolecular coordination complexes with both luminescent and mesogenic properties is a contemporary challenge. Herein we report two rhomboidal metallacycles based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Because metal&#8208;coordination interactions restrict the rotation of phenyl groups on tetraphenylethene units, these metallacycles were emissive both in solution and in solid state, and their aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties were well retained. Moreover, the rhomboidal metallacyclic structures offer a platform for intermolecular packing benefical for the formation of liquid crystalline phases. Therefore, although neither of building blocks shows mesogenic properties, both thermotropic and lyotropic (in DMF) mesophases were observed in one of metallacycles indicating that mesophases could be induced by metal&#8208;coordination interactions.

      <title>Deciphering iron&#8208;dependent activity in oxygen evolution catalyzed by nickel iron layered double hydroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Nickel iron oxyhydroxide is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Whereas the presence of Fe ions is essential to the high activity, the functions of Fe are currently under debate. Using oxygen isotope labelling and operando Raman spectroscopic experiments, we obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites for a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are structurally defined samples of the corresponding oxyhydroxides. The Fe sites have TOFs 20&#8208;200 times higher than the Ni sites such that at an Fe content of 4.7% and above the Fe sites dominate the catalysis. Higher Fe contents lead to larger structural disorder of the NiOOH host. A Volcano&#8208;type correlation was found between the TOFs of Fe sites and the structural disorder of NiOOH. Our work elucidates the origin of the Fe&#8208;dependent activity of NiFe LDH, and suggests structural ordering as a strategy to improve OER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nickel iron oxyhydroxide is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Whereas the presence of Fe ions is essential to the high activity, the functions of Fe are currently under debate. Using oxygen isotope labelling and operando Raman spectroscopic experiments, we obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites for a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are structurally defined samples of the corresponding oxyhydroxides. The Fe sites have TOFs 20&#8208;200 times higher than the Ni sites such that at an Fe content of 4.7% and above the Fe sites dominate the catalysis. Higher Fe contents lead to larger structural disorder of the NiOOH host. A Volcano&#8208;type correlation was found between the TOFs of Fe sites and the structural disorder of NiOOH. Our work elucidates the origin of the Fe&#8208;dependent activity of NiFe LDH, and suggests structural ordering as a strategy to improve OER catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Benzilic Ester Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>We report the first examples of catalytic enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement reaction. In the presence of catalytic amount of Cu(OTf)  2  and a chiral box ligand under mild conditions, reaction of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters with alcohols afforded structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl(alkyl) substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy malonates (tartronic esters) in good to excellent yields with high enantioselectivities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that hemiketalization, rather than the DKR of hemiketal, was the enantiodetermining step under our reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Abnormal Ionic Conductivities in Halide NaBi3O4Cl2 Induced by Absorbing Water and Derived Oxhydryl Group</title>
      <dc:description>In hunting for safe and cost&#8208;effective materials for post lithium&#8208;ion energy storage systems, design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance solid electrolytes (SEs) are currently bottlenecks for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Many issues need to be addressed, such as chemical stability during processing, storing and using in ambient condition. Therefore, we investigate the effect of water as well as oxyhdryl group (&#9642;OH) on NaBi  3  O  4  Cl  2  through evaluating ionic conductivity. It is noted that presence of water and &#9642;OH results in an increase in ionic conductivity of NaBi  3  O  4  Cl  2  due to the diffusion of H  2  O into NaBi  3  O  4  Cl  2  and partially forming binding &#9642;OH through oxygen vacancy repairing. Furthermore, Ab intio calculation reveals that the electrons significantly accumulate around &#9642;OH and induce a more negative charge center which can promote Na  +  hopping. This finding provides a fundamental for understanding the essential role of H  2  O in halide&#8208;based SEs and hence provides possible roles in designing water&#8208;insensitive SEs through defects control.</dc:description>
