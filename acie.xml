      <title>Insights into charge transfer at the atomically precise nanocluster/semiconductor interface for in&#8208;depth understanding the role of nanocluster in photocatalytic system</title>
      <dc:description>A cluster/semiconductor model is built for exploring the role of noble metal clusters in a photocatalytic system.

      <title>Switchable Polymerization Triggered by Fast and Quantitative Insertion of Carbon Monoxide into Cobalt&#8211;Oxygen Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide is used as a molecular trigger to switch the polymerization mechanism of a cobalt Salen complex from ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides to organometallic mediated controlled radical polymerization (OMRP) of acrylates. Regulated by both CO and visible light, on&#8208;demand sequence control can be achieved for the synthesis of polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polyacrylate diblock copolymers.







Abstract
A strategy that uses carbon monoxide (CO) as a molecular trigger to switch the polymerization mechanism of a cobalt Salen complex [salen=(R,R)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine] from ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides to organometallic mediated controlled radical polymerization (OMRP) of acrylates is described. The key phenomenon is a rapid and quantitative insertion of CO into the Co&#8722;O bond, allowing for in situ transformation of the ROCOP active species (Salen)CoIII&#8208;OR into the OMRP photoinitiator (Salen)CoIII&#8208;CO2R. The proposed mechanism, which involves CO coordination to (Salen)CoIII&#8208;OR and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement via migratory insertion has been rationalized by DFT calculations. Regulated by both CO and visible light, on&#8208;demand sequence control can be achieved for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polyacrylate diblock copolymers (&#272;&lt;1.15).

      <title>Activating Pronucleophiles with High pKa Values: Chiral Organo&#8208;Superbases</title>
      <dc:description>
Superbase: This minireview focuses on chiral organo&#8208;superbases as catalysts in asymmetric reactions of pronucleophiles with high pKa values. The performance of the organo&#8208;superbases, compared to conventional tertiary amine bases, is highlighted. The advantage of these new superbases lies in the opportunity to develop more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.







Abstract
Direct deprotonation represents an extremely simple, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economic strategy to activate pronucleophiles bearing an acidic proton. However, the difficulty often arises in activating pronucleophiles with high pKa values by using conventional chiral tertiary amines. To overcome this challenge, a handful of novel chiral Br&#248;nsted superbases, including amidines, guanidines, cyclopropenimines, and iminophosphoranes, have been discovered in recent years. This minireview focuses on the application of these organo&#8208;superbases in the catalytic asymmetric reactions of weakly acidic pronucleophiles, and highlights their comparison to the conventional tertiary amines, demonstrating the highly efficient deprotonation processes and stereoselectivity controlled conversions of the superbases. The advantage of these new superbases brings a great opportunity for developing more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.

      <dc:description>The incorporation of comonomers during ethylene polymerization can efficiently modulate important material properties of polyolefins. Utilizing bio&#8208;resourced comonomers for the generation of high&#8208;performance polyolefin materials is attractive from a sustainable point of view. In this contribution, some bio&#8208;resourced eugenol and related comonomers were incorporated into polyolefins through palladium catalyzed copolymerization and terpolymerization reactions. Importantly, high molecular weight catechol functionalized polyolefins can be generated. The introduction of different metal ions can induce efficient interactions with the incorporated catechol groups, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties. Moreover, catechol functionality can greatly improve other properties such as surface properties, adhesion properties, and compatibilizing properties. The catechol functionalized polyolefin was demonstrated as a versatile platform polymer to access various materials with dramatically different properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement controlled by optical manipulation</title>
      <dc:description>We present spatiotemporal control of aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of a protonated tetraphenylethene derivative by optical manipulation. A single sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized aggregate is initially confined by laser irradiation when its fluorescence is hardly detectable. The continuous irradiation into the formed aggregate leads to sudden and rapid growth, resulting in bright yellow fluorescence emission. The fluorescence intensity at peak wavelength at 540 nm is tremendously enhanced with the growth, meaning that AIEE is activated by optical manipulation. Amazingly, the switching on/off of the activation of AIEE is controlled arbitrarily by alternating laser power. This means that optical manipulation increases local concentration, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated molecules, namely, optical manipulation changes the aggregate structure. The dynamics and mechanism in AIEE controlled by optical manipulation will be discussed from the viewpoint of molecular conformation and association depending on laser power.</dc:description>

      <title>BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>A series of BN&#8208;embedded oligomers with different pairs of BN units have been successfully synthesized through electrophilic borylation processes. Organolithium intermediate is avoided in this approach and thus multiple pairs of BN units up to four have been facilely incorporated in the large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Their geometric, photophysical, electrochemical, and Lewis acidic properties have been systematically investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, optical spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry measurements. It is found that the B&#8208;N bonds show delocalized double&#8208;bond characteristics and the conjugation can be extended through the trans&#8208;orientated aromatic azaborine units. Further theoretical calculations reveal the relatively lower aromaticities for the inner azaborine rings in the BN&#8208;embedded PAH oligomers. Moreover, the frontier orbitals of the longer oligomers are delocalized over the inner aromatic rings with negligible weights on the two terminal sides. Consequently, the inner moieties of the BN&#8208;embedded PAH oligomers are more active than the outer parts. This assumption is further confirmed by a simple oxidation reaction and the product is verified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Most interestingly, the oxidation has significant effects on the aromaticities and the intramolecular charge transfer interactions in these BN&#8208;embedded PAHs.

We demonstrated that these chiral l/d&#8208;NPs interfered with the self&#8208;assembly of A&#946;42 monomers and triggered the A&#946;42 fibrils in dense structures to become looser monomers under 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. Our data showed that d&#8208;  Fe  x  Cu  y  Se  NPs had a  much  higher affinity for A&#946;42 fibrils than l&#8208;Fe  x  Cu  y  Se NPs and chiral Cu  2&#8208;x  Se NPs. The chiral Fe  x  Cu  y  Se NPs also generated higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) than chiral  Cu  2&#8208;x  Se NPs  under NIR light irradiation  .  It has been found that in living MN9D cells, the d&#8208;NPs attenuated the adhesion of A&#946;42 to membranes and neuron loss after NIR treatment within 10 min without photothermal effect.

      <title>Molten Salt Mediated Synthesis of Atomic Ni Co&#8208;catalyst on TiO2 for Improved Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Atomic co&#8208;catalysts offer high potential to improve the photocatalytic water splitting performance, while the preparation of atomic co&#8208;catalysts with earth&#8208;abundant elements remains challenging. In this work, a new molten salt method (MSM) is designed to prepare atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst on widely studied TiO  2  nanoparticles. The liquid environment and space confinement effect of the molten salt lead to atomic dispersion of Ni ions on TiO  2  , while the strong polarizing force provided by the molten salt promotes the formation of strong Ni&#8208;O bonds. Interestingly, it is found that Ni atoms facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies on the neighbouring surface of TiO  2  during the MSM process, which benefits the charge transfer and hydrogen evolution reaction. Because of the synergy of atomic Ni co&#8208;catalyst and oxygen vacancies, the resultant photocatalyst exhibits a four&#8208;time improvement in H  2  evolution rate compared to that of Ni co&#8208;catalyst on TiO  2  photocatalyst prepared by a traditional impregnation method. This work provides a new strategy of controlling atomic co&#8208;catalyst together with defects for efficient photocatalytic water splitting.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;based homolytic substitution (SH) plays an important role in synthetic chemistry, yet whether such a chemistry could occur on the positively charged sulfonium compounds remains unknown. In the study of the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN, a radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme involved in Heme biosynthesis, we observed the production of di&#8208;(5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl)methylsulfonium, supporting&#160; a deoxyadenosyl (dAdo) radical&#8208;mediated SH reaction on the sulfonium center of SAM. The sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions were then investigated in detail by density functional theory calculations and by model reactions, showing that such a type of reactions is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically competent. These findings represent the first report of sulfonium&#8208;based SH reactions, which could be useful in synthetic chemistry. Our study also demonstrates the remarkable catalytic promiscuity of the radical SAM superfamily enzymes, which could be a treasury in studying organic reactions.</dc:description>

Despite their importance, there has been so far no statistical assessment of the performances of these five empirical rules. Here, we test rigorously and automatically all five Pauling rules for a large data set of around 5000 known oxides. We discuss each Pauling rule separately stressing their limits and range of application in terms of chemistries and structures. We conclude that only 13% of the oxides simultaneously satisfy the last four rules, indicating their much lower predictive power than expected.</dc:description>

      <title>Solar&#8722;Powered Organic Semiconductor&#8722;Bacteria Biohybrids for CO2 Reduction into Acetic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Photosynthetic biohybrid systems have emerged as a promising platform for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion by integrating excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability of semiconductors with the synthetic capability of biological cells. How to enhance the utilization of solar energy, hole/electron separation efficiency and the electron transfer between the semiconductor and biological cells is crucial to develop high&#8208;performance photosynthesis platforms. In this work, we developed an organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrid photosynthetic system, which could efficiently realize CO  2  reduction to produce acetic acid through non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria  Moorella thermoacetica  . As the photosensitizers, both cationic electron&#8208;transporting (  n  &#8208;type) perylene diimide derivative (PDI) and hole&#8208;transporting (  p  &#8208;type) poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) were coated on the bacteria surface to form  p  &#8208;  n  heterojunction (PFP/PDI) layer, affording higher hole/electron separation efficiency. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess excellent light&#8208;harvesting ability and biocompatibility, and more importantly, the cationic side chains of organic semiconductors could intercalate into cell membrane, ensuring the efficient electron transfer to bacteria. As a result,  Moorella thermoacetica  can harvest photoexcited electrons from the PFP/PDI heterojunction, which can drive the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway to synthesize acetic acid from CO  2  under illumination. The efficiency of this organic biohybrid is &#8764; 1.6%, which is comparable to those of reported inorganic biohybrid systems. This work opens a new avenue to explore bioenergy application of organic semiconductors, and also provides a convenient biomanufacturing approach to design organic semiconductor&#8722;bacteria biohybrids for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g&#8208;C3N4): An Interface Enabler for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Compatible interfaces: A garnet&#8208;compatible Li&#8208;C3N4 composite anode, with a Li3N&#8208;rich surface, was synthesized from Li and g&#8208;C3N4. The composite electrodes enable a low interfacial resistance and a high critical current density for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLMBs) have attracted considerable interests due to their promising energy density as well as high safety. However, the realization of a well&#8208;matched Li metal/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface remains challenging. Herein, we report g&#8208;C3N4 as a new interface enabler. We discover that introducing g&#8208;C3N4 into Li metal can not only convert the Li metal/garnet&#8208;type SSE interface from point contact to intimate contact but also greatly enhance the capability to suppress the dendritic Li formation because of the greatly enhanced viscosity, decreased surface tension of molten Li, and the in&#8197;situ formation of Li3N at the interface. Thus, the resulting Li&#8208;C3N4|SSE|Li&#8208;C3N4 symmetric cell gives a significantly low interfacial resistance of 11&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2 and a high critical current density (CCD) of 1500&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In contrast, the same symmetric cell configuration with pristine Li metal electrodes has a much larger interfacial resistance (428&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2) and a much lower CCD (50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

      <title>Unravelling the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Substitution in BiO2&#8722;x for Efficient Molecular&#8208;Oxygen Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual defects: Introducing dual defects (surface oxygen vacancies and bulk oxygen substitution) in cubic BiO2&#8722;x was found to lead to a spatial and electronic synergistic process in photocatalytic molecular O2 activation. Oxygen substitution can induce a local electric field to promote bulk separation of electrons and holes, and oxygen vacancies serve as capture centers for electrons to facilitate the adsorption and activation of O2 (see picture).







Abstract
Defects in nanomaterials often lead to properties that are absent in their pristine counterparts. To date, most studies have focused on the effect of single defects, while ignoring the synergy of multiple defects. In this study, a model of photocatalytic O2 activation was selected to unravel the role of dual defects by decorating bismuth oxide with surface O vacancies and bulk O substitution simultaneously. The introduction of dual defects led to a spatial and electronic synergistic process: i)&#8197;O substitution induced a local electric field in the bulk of BiO2&#8722;x, which promoted bulk separation of electrons and holes immediately after their generation; ii)&#8197;O vacancies efficiently lowered the conduction band, served as the capture center for electrons, and thus facilitated the adsorption and activation of O2. This effect was greatly promoted by the coexistence of bulk O substitution, and DFT calculations showed that only O substitution near an O vacancy could have this effect.

      <title>The Importance of 1,5&#8208;Oxygen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Chalcogen Interactions in Enantioselective Isochalcogenourea Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformational and computational analyses of N&#8208;acyl isochalcogenouronium species and comparison with kinetic data demonstrate the significance of 1,5&#8208;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions in enantioselective catalysis.

Abstract
The importance of 1,5&#8208;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;chalcogen (Ch) interactions in isochalcogenourea catalysis (Ch=O, S, Se) is investigated. Conformational analyses of N&#8208;acyl isochalcogenouronium species and comparison with kinetic data demonstrate the significance of 1,5&#8208;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions in enantioselective catalysis. Importantly, the selenium analogue demonstrates enhanced rate and selectivity profiles across a range of reaction processes including nitronate conjugate addition and formal [4+2] cycloadditions. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the most active selenium analogue was developed using a previously unreported seleno&#8208;Hugerschoff reaction, allowing the challenging kinetic resolutions of tertiary alcohols to be performed at 500&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory (DFT) and natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations support the role of orbital delocalization (occurring by intramolecular chalcogen bonding) in determining the conformation, equilibrium population, and reactivity of N&#8208;acylated intermediates.

      <title>Formulation of Blended&#8208;Lithium&#8208;Salt Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The right mix: Blended&#8208;salt electrolytes have aroused great interest in the burgeoning field of next&#8208;generation lithium batteries. This Review discusses the evolution of blended&#8208;salt electrolytes with the aims of summarizing the key scientific issues related to their formulation and providing meaningful perspectives for their future development toward practical applications.







Abstract
Blended&#8208;salt electrolytes showing synergistic effects have been formulated by simply mixing several lithium salts in an electrolyte. In the burgeoning field of next&#8208;generation lithium batteries, blended&#8208;salt electrolytes have enabled great progress to be made. In this Review, the development of such blended&#8208;salt electrolytes is examined in detail. The reasons for formulating blended&#8208;salt electrolytes for lithium batteries include improvement of thermal stability (safety), inhibition of aluminum&#8208;foil corrosion of the cathode current collector, enhancement of performance over a wide temperature range (or at a high or low temperature), formation of favorable interfacial layers on both electrodes, protection of the lithium metal anode, and attainment of high ionic conductivity. Herein, we highlight key scientific issues related to the formulation of blended&#8208;salt electrolytes for lithium batteries.

      <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Strategies To Interfere with Protein Misfolding, Aggregation, and Cell Degeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
Aberrant protein aggregation in amyloid fibrils is linked to many devastating and thus far incurable cell&#8208;degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, only one of the numerous anti&#8208;amyloid candidates has reached the clinic. This Minireview discusses peptide&#8208;based molecular strategies and peptide chemistry &#8220;tools&#8221; for the design, development, and discovery of peptides as leads for anti&#8208;amyloid drugs.







Abstract
Protein misfolding into amyloid fibrils is linked to more than 40 as yet incurable cell&#8208; and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type&#8197;2 diabetes. So far, however, only one of the numerous anti&#8208;amyloid molecules has reached patients. This Minireview gives an overview of molecular strategies and peptide chemistry &#8220;tools&#8221; to design, develop, and discover peptide&#8208;based molecules as anti&#8208;amyloid drug candidates. We focus on two major inhibitor rational design strategies: 1)&#8197;the oldest and most common strategy, based on molecular recognition elements of amyloid self&#8208;assembly, and 2)&#8197;a more recent approach, based on cross&#8208;amyloid interactions. We discuss why peptide&#8208;based amyloid inhibitors, in particular their advanced generations, can be promising leads or candidates for anti&#8208;amyloid drugs as well as valuable tools for deciphering amyloid&#8208;mediated cell damage and its link to disease pathogenesis.

      <title>Uncovering the Neglected Similarities of Arynes and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Two sides of the same coin? Arynes and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes show striking similarities in their reactivity. This Minireview highlights analogous insertion and annulation reactions of these two strained species.







Abstract
Arynes and donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes are two classes of strained systems having the potential for numerous applications in organic synthesis. The last two decades have witnessed a renaissance of interest in the chemistry of these species primarily because of the mild and robust methods for their generation or activation. Commonly, arynes as easily polarizable systems result in 1,2&#8208;disubstitution, whereas D&#8208;A cyclopropanes as polarized systems lead to 1,3&#8208;bisfunctionalization thereby showing striking similarities. Transformations with 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;dipoles afford cyclic structures. With arynes, emerging four&#8208;membered rings as intermediates might react further, whereas the analogous five&#8208;membered rings obtained from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes are most often the final products. However, there are a few cases where these intermediates behave surprisingly differently. This Minireview highlights the parallels in reactivity between arynes and D&#8211;A cyclopropanes thereby shedding light on the neglected similarities of these two reactive species.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Polyhedra with Highly Entangled Faces Induced by Metal&#8211;Acetylene Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Pile, oligomerize, and tangle: The complexation of a twisted triarylmethane ligand with CuI or AgI ions afforded M6L4, M12L8, and M18L12 coordination polyhedra that can be considered as cross&#8208;linked and tangled oligomers of a hypothetical double&#8208;propeller M3L2 subunit supported by weak acetylene&#8211;&#960; coordination.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of nanostructures is dominated by a limited number of strong coordination elements. Herein, we show that metal&#8211;acetylene &#960;&#8208;coordination of a tripodal ligand (L) with acetylene spacers gave an M3L2 double&#8208;propeller motif (M=CuI or AgI), which dimerized into an M6L4 interlocked cage (M=CuI). Higher (M3L2)n oligomers were also selectively obtained: an M12L8 truncated tetrahedron (M=CuI) and an M18L12 truncated trigonal prism (M=AgI), both of which contain the same double&#8208;propeller motif.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pile, oligomerize, and tangle&lt;/b&gt;: The complexation of a twisted triarylmethane ligand with Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; or Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ions afforded M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, and M&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; coordination polyhedra that can be considered as cross&#8208;linked and tangled oligomers of a hypothetical double&#8208;propeller M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunit supported by weak acetylene&#8211;&#960; coordination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self&#8208;assembly of nanostructures is dominated by a limited number of strong coordination elements. Herein, we show that metal&#8211;acetylene &#960;&#8208;coordination of a tripodal ligand (L) with acetylene spacers gave an M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; double&#8208;propeller motif (M=Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; or Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;), which dimerized into an M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; interlocked cage (M=Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;). Higher (M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; oligomers were also selectively obtained: an M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; truncated tetrahedron (M=Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;) and an M&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; truncated trigonal prism (M=Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;), both of which contain the same double&#8208;propeller motif. The higher oligomers exhibit multiply entangled facial structures that are classified as a trefoil knot and a Solomon link. The inner cavities of the structures encapsulate counteranions, revealing a potential new strategy towards the synthesis of functional hollow structures that is powered by molecular entanglements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapd Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bisphosphine Derivatives through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Hydrophosphination</title>
      <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Bisphosphines have been identified as one class of important and powerful chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis with transition metals. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfides was developed with the assistance of &#8220;soft&#8208;soft interaction&#8221; between copper(I)&#8208;catalyst and the phosphine sulfide moiety, which afforded 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine derivatives with diversified electronic nature and steric hindrance in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, the challenging catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphination/protonation reaction was achieved with excellent enantioselectivity. Strikingly, the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic diarylphosphines was also successfully carried out with high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Interestingly, the nucleophilic copper(I)&#8208;diphenylphosphide species was characterized by  31  P NMR spectrum and mass spectrum. At last, three products were transformed to chiral 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines, which were employed as ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester. The &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative was produced in high enantioselectivity, which demonstrated the utility of the present methodology.</dc:description>

Selective consumption of the first RAFT agent is used to control the cationic RAFT polymerization of a vinyl ether monomer bearing a secondary dormant RAFT agent, which subsequently allows side&#8208;chain polymers to be grafted from the pendant RAFT agent by a radical&#8208;mediated RAFT polymerization of a different monomer, thus completing the synthesis of bottlebrush polymers.

Here we report a simple method for synthesizing acyclic diketene acetal monomers from diols and vinyl ether, and their polymerization with a diol to first synthesize PAOEs. The PAOEs rapidly hydrolyzed at lysosomal pH. With the help of a cationic lipid, ovalbumin, a model vaccine antigen, was efficiently loaded into PAOEs nanoparticles using a double emulsion method. These nanoparticles efficiently delivered ovalbumin into the cytosol of dendritic cells and demonstrated enhanced antigen presentation over PLGA nanoparticles.

      <title>Synthesis of disulfide surrogate peptides incorporating large&#8208;span surrogate bridges through a native chemical ligation&#8208;assisted diaminodiacid strategy</title>
      <dc:description>The use of synthetic bridges as surrogates for disulfide bonds has emerged as a practical strategy to obviate the poor stability of some disulfide&#8208;containing peptides. However, peptides incorporating large&#8208;span synthetic bridges are still beyond the reach of existing methods. Here we report a native chemical ligation (NCL)&#8208;assisted diaminodiacid (DADA) strategy that enables the robust generation of disulfide surrogate peptides incorporating surrogate bridges up to 50 amino acids in length. This strategy provides access, for this first time, to some highly desirable but otherwise impossible&#8208;to&#8208;obtain disulfide surrogates of bioactive peptides, including &#956;&#8208;conotoxin KIIIA, a potent inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels. The bioactivities and structures of the synthetic disulfide surrogates were verified by voltage clamp assays, NMR, and X&#8208;ray crystallography; and stability studies established that the disulfide replacements effectively overcame the problems of disulfide reduction and scrambling that often plague these pharmacologically important peptides. By expanding access to structurally more diverse disulfide surrogate peptides, the NCL&#8208;assisted DADA strategy is expected to facilitate the development of peptide&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photo&#8208;redox mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (photo&#8208;ROMP) is an emerging ROMP technique that uses an organic redox mediator and a vinyl ether initiator, in contrast to metal&#8208;based initiators traditionally used in ROMP.

This method enables access to low molecular weight oligomers, and molecular weights between 1 and 30 kDa can be targeted simply by altering the stoichiometry of the reaction. This method of molecular weight control was then used to synthesize a functionalized norbornene copolymer in a range of molecular weights for specific materials applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Development of Chiral Organosuperbase Catalysts Consisting of Two Different Organobase Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>In the field of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, a new generation of chiral catalysts has been highly anticipated to overcome the intrinsic limitation of pronucleophiles that are applicable to the enantioselective reactions. Herein, we reveal conceptually new chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts consisting of two different organobase functionalities, one of which functions as an organosuperbase and the other as the substrate recognition site. Their prominent activity, which stems from the distinctive cooperative function by the two organobases in a single catalyst molecule, was demonstrated in the unprecedented enantioselective direct Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;&#8208;phenylthioacetate as a less acidic pronucleophile. The present achievement would provide a new guiding principle for the design and development of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts and significantly broaden the utility of Br&#248;nsted base catalysis in asymmetric organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the field of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, a new generation of chiral catalysts has been highly anticipated to overcome the intrinsic limitation of pronucleophiles that are applicable to the enantioselective reactions. Herein, we reveal conceptually new chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts consisting of two different organobase functionalities, one of which functions as an organosuperbase and the other as the substrate recognition site. Their prominent activity, which stems from the distinctive cooperative function by the two organobases in a single catalyst molecule, was demonstrated in the unprecedented enantioselective direct Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;&#8208;phenylthioacetate as a less acidic pronucleophile. The present achievement would provide a new guiding principle for the design and development of chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysts and significantly broaden the utility of Br&#248;nsted base catalysis in asymmetric organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>The field of electrochemical synthesis has developed rapidly over the last decade and provided alternative synthetic methods without using stoichiometric amounts of chemical oxidants or reductants. Although sustainable procedures of electrosynthesis have been developed, relatively few examples of highly enantioselective catalytic electrosynthesis have been reported to date. The development of general strategies for electrochemical enantiocontrol has thus proven to be a considerable challenge. This Minireview highlights the current knowledge and recent advances emerging synthetic utility of electrochemical transformation in asymmetric synthesis. Specifically, we outlines three major types of catalytic enantioselective strategies in electrosynthesis, including electrochemical activation of chiral catalyst&#8208;bound substrate, asymmetric cascade electrochemical process, and chemically modified chiral electrode.</dc:description>

The concept of the crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission effect should be updated and extended to an in&#8208;depth spatial effect, such as electron overlap and energy splitting in confined domains by effective crosslinking, more than initial immobilization.

Herein, we successfully synthesize the first antimony(III) borate in closed system, namely SbB  3  O  6  .

Dearomative cycloaddition reactions with indoles, providing direct access to diverse heterocyclic compounds with increased topology, are of high relevance.

A simple and commercially available Gd(OTf)  3  salt is sufficient for this visible violet light induced transformation.

      <title>A Photochemical Organocatalytic Strategy for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones using Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>Reported herein is a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach to the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones. This method exploits the ability of a nucleophilic organocatalyst to generate radicals upon S  N  2&#8208;based activation of alkyl halides and blue light irradiation.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical approach to the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones. This method exploits the ability of a nucleophilic organocatalyst to generate radicals upon S  N  2&#8208;based activation of alkyl halides and blue light irradiation. The resulting open&#8208;shell intermediates are then intercepted by weakly nucleophilic silyl enol ethers, which would be unable to directly attack the alkyl halides through a traditional two&#8208;electron path. The method&#8217;s mild reaction conditions allowed us to functionalize the &#945; position of ketones with functional groups that are not compatible with classical anionic strategies. In addition, the redox&#8208;neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with a cinchona&#8208;based primary amine catalyst, which was used to develop a rare example of enantioselective organocatalytic radical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An Enzymatic N&#8208;Acylation Step Enables the Biocatalytic Synthesis of Unnatural Sialosides</title>
      <dc:description>
The selective N&#8208;acylation of glucosamine with unprotected carboxylic acids enables the biosynthesis of unnatural glycosides and their subsequent enzymatic modification. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914338), L. Liu, S.&#8197;L. Flitsch, J. Voglmeir et&#8197;al. report that the enzyme chitobiose deacetylase from Cyclobacterium marinum has promiscuous N&#8208;acylation activity without the need for activation of the acid. This selective N&#8208;acylation step provides the last missing link for the fully enzymatic multistep synthesis of C5&#8208;modified sialosides from chitin.

&lt;p&gt;The selective N&#8208;acylation of glucosamine with unprotected carboxylic acids enables the biosynthesis of unnatural glycosides and their subsequent enzymatic modification. In their Communication (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20191433810.1002/anie.201914338&lt;/a&gt;), L. Liu, S.&#8197;L. Flitsch, J. Voglmeir et&#8197;al. report that the enzyme chitobiose deacetylase from &lt;i&gt;Cyclobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; has promiscuous N&#8208;acylation activity without the need for activation of the acid. This selective N&#8208;acylation step provides the last missing link for the fully enzymatic multistep synthesis of C5&#8208;modified sialosides from chitin.

      <title>The Ultimate Method for the Programmed Synthesis of Mutifunctional Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrroles from aldehydes, primary amines, nitriles and diethyl oxalacetate has been developed. It is now possible to prepare diketopyrrolopyrroles bearing an ordered arrangement of three different substituents from abundant and commercially available materials allowing the independent regulation of all desired physicochemical properties. For the first time very electron&#8208;rich (carbazo&#8208;3&#8208;yl, dimethylaminophenyl, pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;  b  ]pyrrolyl) and sterically hindered substituents (naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl, quinolin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, acridin&#8208;9&#8208;yl, imidazo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;yl, 2&#8208;bromophenyl, etc.) can be appended to the diketopyrrolopyrrole core  via  condensation of an appropriate nitrile with a pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. Even greater synthetic possibilities are related to the fact that such demanding substituents as 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl, indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl and 2&#8208;methoxyphenyl can be incorporated from aldehyde precursors, bypassing problems with the nitriles reactivity. Starting from terephthaldehyde, previously inaccessible bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrroles can also be obtained. The ability to incorporate an unprecedented variety of substituents translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties such as shifting the absorption and emission across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching the highest recorded Stokes shift for a diketopyrrolopyrrole (5800 cm  &#8722;1  ) and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Vibralactone is isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Boreostereum vibrans  as one of the strongest lipase inhibitors. Its unusual &#946;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused bicycle is derived from an aryl ring moiety via an oxidative ring&#8208;expansion prior to an intramolecular cyclization.

Biochemical and crystal studies suggest that VibC may catalyze an aldol or an electrocyclic reaction initiated by the catalytic Ser&#8208;His&#8208;Asp triad. For the aldol and pericyclic chemistry in living cells, VibC is a unique hydrolase performing the carbocycle formation of an oxepinone to a fused bicyclic b&#8208;lactone.

      <title>Multifunctional Au(I)&#8208;based AIEgens: Manipulating Molecular Structures and Boosting Specific Cancer Cell Imaging and Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>Gold(I)  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au(I)&#8208;NHC) complexes have emerged as a new generation of potential anticancer agents due to their impressively high cytotoxicity and stability. Integration of their above unique functions with customized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens to achieve specific bioimaging and efficient theranostics to cancer is highly desirable but is rarely studied. In this work, we have developed a series of novel Au(I)&#8208;NHC compounds with AIE characteristics. Through systematic biological evaluation and comparison, complex  1  with triphenyl phosphine ligand was selected out as it could achieve both prominent specific imaging of various cancer cells and efficient inhibition of their growth with negligible toxic effects on normal cells due to the targeting binding and strong inhibition towards thioredoxin reductase. Complex  1  could also act as a powerful radiosensitizers to boost the anticancer efficacy with performance superior to that of popularly used auranofin. Thus, complex  1  holds great potential as a specific and effective theranostic drug in cancer diagnosis and precise therapy. The present work is anticipated to open a new avenue to the development of novel Au&#8208;based bioprobes and drug candidates.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogenolysis of Polysilanes Catalyzed by Low Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of organosilanes (RxSiH4&#8208;x) under formation of Si&#8211;Si bonds is an intensively investigated process leading to oligo&#8208; or polysilanes. The reverse reaction is little studied. Up to date, the hydrogenolysis of Si&#8211;Si bonds requires very harsh conditions and is very unselective leading to multiple side products. Here we describe a new catalytic hydrogenation of oligo&#8208; and polysilanes, which is highly selective and proceeds under mild conditions. New low valent nickel hydride complexes are used as catalysts and secondary silanes, RR&#8217;SiH2, are obtained as products in high purity.</dc:description>

      <title>The glutathione/metallothionein system challenges the design of efficient O2&#8208;activating Cu&#8208;complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Copper&#8208;complexes are of medicinal and biological interest, including as anticancer drugs designed to cleave intracellular biomolecules  via  O  2  activation. To exhibit such activity, the copper complex must be redox&#8208;active and resistant to dissociation. Metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are abundant in the cytosol and nucleus.

Here, we investigated a panel of Cu  I  / Cu  II  &#8208;complexes often used as drugs, from various classes, with diverse coordination chemistries and redox potentials. We evaluated their catalytic activity in ascorbate oxidation based on redox&#8208;cycling between Cu  I  and Cu  II  , as well as their resistance to dissociation or inactivation under cytosolically&#8208;relevant concentrations of GSH and MT.

      <title>A Universal Strategy toward Ultrasmall Hollow Nanostructures with Remarkable Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Hollow nanostructures have shown enormous potentials in many fields, but the convenient synthesis of ultrasmall hollow nanostructures with a wide range of compositions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report a facile and versatile microwave&#8208;assisted and shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion strategy to fabricate a variety of ultrasmall hollow nanoparticles by modulating the growth and thermal conversion of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals on graphene. Unlike traditional thermal treat route, our method involves that the adsorption of microwave by graphene creates a high&#8208;energy environment in a short time to decompose the in&#8208;situ grown MOF nanocrystals into well&#8208;dispersed uniform core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with ultrasmall size rather than large aggregated particles. Upon a newly disclosed shell&#8208;confined Kirkendall diffusion process, a series of hollow nanoparticles of multi&#8208;metal oxides, phosphides, and sulfides with the diameter below 20 nm and shell thickness below 3 nm can be successfully obtained for the first time. We further revealed that ultrasmall hollow nanostructure such as Fe  2  O  3  can promote much faster charge transport and expose more active sites as well as migrate the volume change stress more efficiently than the solid and large hollow counterparts, thus demonstrating remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage performance including ultrahigh reversible capacity (1167 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  ), excellent rate performance (701 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ) and outstanding cycling stability (97.8% after 1200 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ), which is among the best results reported so far. This study provides an exciting way to design hollow nanostructured functional materials for electrochemical energy storage and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Native S&#8208;Palmitoylated Membrane Proteins through Removable&#8208;Backbone&#8208;Modification&#8208;Assisted Ser/Thr Ligation</title>
      <dc:description>
Native proteins by non&#8208;native methods: An RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL strategy (removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted serine/threonine ligation) was developed for the chemical synthesis of native S&#8208;palmitoylated membrane proteins, which have not previously been accessible through chemical synthesis. The successful synthesis of S&#8208;palmitoylated sarcolipin and M2 demonstrates the importance of non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.







Abstract
The preparation of native S&#8208;palmitoylated (S&#8208;palm) membrane proteins is one of the unsolved challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, we report the first chemical synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins by removable&#8208;backbone&#8208;modification&#8208;assisted Ser/Thr ligation (RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL). This method involves two critical steps: 1)&#8197;synthesis of S&#8208;palm peptides by a new &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid based RBM (RBMGABA) strategy, and 2)&#8197;ligation of the S&#8208;palm RBM&#8208;modified peptides to give the desired S&#8208;palm product by the STL method. The utility of the RBMGABA&#8208;assisted STL method was demonstrated by the synthesis of rabbit S&#8208;palm sarcolipin (SLN) and S&#8208;palm matrix&#8208;2 (M2) ion channel. The synthesis of S&#8208;palm membrane proteins highlights the importance of developing non&#8208;NCL methods for chemical protein synthesis.

Ovsyannikov et&#8197;al., as reported in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201914988). Near 275&#8197;K, the material undergoes a Verwey&#8208;type charge&#8208;ordering transition that is concurrent with a dimerization in the iron chains and the formation of new Fe&#8722;Fe bonds. This unique feature highlights Fe5O6 as a promising candidate for use in innovative applications.

      <title>Direct Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams from Acrylamides and Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of unprotected &#948;&#8208;lactams has been realized starting from readily accessible acrylamides and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides an efficient means of synthesizing a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines.







Abstract
We report a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available acrylamide derivatives and unactivated alkenes. The reaction provides a rapid route to a diverse set of &#948;&#8208;lactams in good yield and stereoselectivity, which serve as useful building blocks for substituted piperidines. The regioselectivity of the reaction with unactivated terminal alkene is significantly improved by using Cpt ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The synthetic utility of the reaction is demonstrated by the preparation of a potential drug candidate containing a trisubstituted piperidine moiety. Mechanistic studies show that the reversibility of the C&#8722;H activation depends on the choice of Cp ligand on the RhIII catalyst. The irreversible C&#8722;H activation is observed and becomes turnover&#8208;limiting with [CptRhCl2]2 as catalyst.

      <title>An Unexpected Transannular [4+2] Cycloaddition during the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Norcembrene&#8197;5</title>
      <dc:description>
They may look alike&#8230; During studies toward the total synthesis of the norditerpene natural product norcembrene&#8197;5, one diastereomer of a key intermediate (&#945;&#8208;OAc at C13) underwent clean and spontaneous Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition at room temperature (see scheme). However, the corresponding &#946;&#8197;isomer did not undergo a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, but was oxidized to the corresponding furanone, which was further transformed into norcembrene&#8197;5.







Abstract
We report a concise and versatile total synthesis of the diterpenoid (+)&#8208;norcembrene&#8197;5 from simple building blocks. Ring&#8208;closing metathesis and an auxiliary&#8208;directed 1,4&#8208;addition are the key steps of our synthetic route. During the synthesis, an unprecedented, highly oxidized pentacyclic structural motif was established from a furanocembranoid through transannular [4+2] cycloaddition.

      <title>A Supramolecular Stabilizer of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction with a Synergistic Mode of Action</title>
      <dc:description>
A stabilizer of the interaction between the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), a driver in the majority of breast cancers, and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;, a negative regulator of ER&#945;, is developed as anti&#8208;cancer strategy. The stabilizer of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms and stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A.







Abstract
We report on a stabilizer of the interaction between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; and the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;). ER&#945; is a driver in the majority of breast cancers and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins are negative regulators of this nuclear receptor, making the stabilization of this protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) an interesting strategy. The stabilizer (1) consists of three symmetric peptidic arms containing an arginine mimetic, previously described as the GCP motif. 1 stabilizes the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction synergistically with the natural product Fusicoccin&#8208;A and was thus hypothesized to bind to a different site. This is supported by computational analysis of 1 binding to the binary complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived phosphopeptide. Furthermore, 1 shows selectivity towards 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; interaction over other 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client&#8208;derived phosphomotifs. These data provide a solid support of a new binding mode for a supramolecular 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950;/ER&#945; PPI stabilizer.
