      <title>Electrochemical Methods for Lithium Recovery: A Comprehensive and Critical Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Due to the ubiquitous presence of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the future availability of Li is under debate. Li utilization will depend on an increase in production. However, the main Li&#8208;extraction method requires years. The most attracting alternative, electrochemical Li recovery, is analyzed, with the employed methodology, materials, and reactors being scrutinized from a critical perspective.








Abstract
Due to the ubiquitous presence of lithium&#8208;ion batteries in portable applications, and their implementation in the transportation and large&#8208;scale energy sectors, the future cost and availability of lithium is currently under debate. Lithium demand is expected to grow in the near future, up to 900 ktons per year in 2025. Lithium utilization would depend on a strong increase in production. However, the currently most extended lithium extraction method, the lime&#8208;soda evaporation process, requires a period of time in the range of 1&#8211;2 years and depends on weather conditions. The actual global production of lithium by this technology will soon be far exceeded by market demand. Alternative production methods have recently attracted great attention. Among them, electrochemical lithium recovery, based on electrochemical ion&#8208;pumping technology, offers higher capacity production, it does not require the use of chemicals for the regeneration of the materials, reduces the consumption of water and the production of chemical wastes, and allows the production rate to be controlled, attending to the market demand. Here, this technology is analyzed with a special focus on the methodology, materials employed, and reactor designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art is reevaluated from a critical perspective and the viability of the different proposed methodologies analyzed.

      <title>A Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Battery with High Energy Efficiency and Long Life Enabled by a Highly Water&#8208;Retentive Gel Electrolyte with Reaction Modifier</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrolytes play a significant role in the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. A developed KI&#8211;PVAA&#8211;GO hydrogel electrolyte enables zinc&#8211;air batteries that exhibit low charge potential of 1.69 V, long working life of 200 h, high energy efficiency of 73%, and excellent practicability for flexible power sources.








Abstract
Tremendous effort have recently been made in optimizing the air catalysts of flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Unfortunately, the bottleneck factors in electrolytes that largely limit the working life and energy efficiency of ZABs have long been relatively neglected. Herein, an alkaline gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is fabricated through multiple crosslinking reactions among poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid), and graphene oxide followed by intense uptake of an alkali and the KI reaction modifier. The prepared GPE exhibits essentially improved properties compared to traditional PVA gel electrolyte in terms of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capability. In addition, the introduced reaction modifier I&#8722; in the GPE changes the path of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, leading to a more thermodynamically favorable path. The optimized GPE enables flexible ZABs exhibiting an exceptionally low charge potential of 1.69 V, a long cycling time of 200 h, a high energy efficiency of 73%, and rugged reliability under different extreme working conditions. Moreover, the successful integration of ZABs in a variety of real wearable electronic devices demonstrates their excellent practicability as flexible power sources.

      <title>Flexible Porous Organic Polymer Membranes for Protonic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
A thiourea&#8208;based porous organic polymer membrane is readily prepared through an atom&#8208;economic thiourea&#8208;formation condensation reaction, and it can serve as an effective proton&#8208;conductive material for protonic field&#8208;effect transistors. The material shows high proton conductivity. The flow of protonic currents can be controlled and monitored by the electrostatic potential applied to the gate electrodes.








Abstract
Artificial transistors represent an ideal means for meeting the requirements in interfacing with biological systems. It is pivotal to develop new proton&#8208;conductive materials for the transduction between biochemical events and electronic signals. Herein, the first demonstration of a porous organic polymer membrane (POPM) as a proton&#8208;conductive material for protonic field&#8208;effect transistors is presented. The POPM is readily prepared through a thiourea&#8208;formation condensation reaction. Under hydrated conditions and at room temperature, the POPM delivers a proton mobility of 5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1; the charge carrier densities are successfully modulated from 4.3 &#215; 1017 to 14.1 &#215; 1017 cm&#8722;3 by the gate voltage. This study provides a type of promising modular proton&#8208;conductive materials for bioelectronics application.

      <title>Site&#8208;Specific Synthesis of Silica Nanostructures on DNA Origami Templates</title>
      <dc:description>
Arbitrary silica nanopatterns are fabricated on DNA origami templates by rationally designing the protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) arrays as nucleation sites. Molecular dynamic simulation confirms that the positively charged silica precursors have a stronger electrostatic affinity to protruding dsDNA than DNA origami surfaces. The site&#8208;specific silicification of DNA nanoarchitectures expands the scope of customized synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials.








Abstract
DNA origami has been widely investigated as a template for the organization of various functional elements, leading to potential applications in many fields such as biosensing, nanoelectronics, and nanophotonics. However, the synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials with predesigned patterns using DNA origami templates has seldom been explored. Here, a novel method is reported to site&#8208;specifically synthesize silica nanostructures with designed patterns on DNA origami templates. The molecular dynamic simulation confirms that the positively charged silica precursors have a stronger electrostatic affinity to protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) than DNA origami surfaces. The work describes a novel strategy to fabricate silica nanostructures with nanoscale precision.

      <title>Heat Capacity and Thermal Damping Properties of Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecules: A New Look at an Old Topic</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermal management of metallic Joule&#8208;heated microwires is experimentally demonstrated using a molecular spin&#8208;crossover film as a thermal damper system. A transient attenuation of the wire temperature, up to 10%, is evidenced due to the excess heat capacity associated with the spin&#8208;state switching, providing a first milestone toward the assessment of the potential of spin&#8208;transition materials for thermal management applications.








Abstract
The thermally induced spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) phenomenon in transition metal complexes is an entropy&#8208;driven process, which has been extensively studied through calorimetric methods. Yet, the excess heat capacity associated with the molecular spin&#8208;state switching has never been explored for practical applications. Herein, the thermal damping effect of an SCO film is experimentally assessed by monitoring the transient heating response of SCO&#8208;coated metallic microwires, Joule&#8208;heated by current pulses. A damping of the wire temperature, up to 10%, is evidenced on a time scale of tens of microseconds due to the spin&#8208;state switching of the molecular film. Fast heat&#8208;charging dynamics and negligible fatigability are demonstrated, which, together with the solid&#8208;solid nature of the spin transition, appear as promising features for achieving thermal energy management applications in functional devices.

      <title>Bioinspired Materials with Self&#8208;Adaptable Mechanical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A synthetic material system is demonstrated to be capable of autonomously changing its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading. The self&#8208;adaptation is achieved with scaffolds that generate signals to induce the addition of minerals proportional to the applied load. This approach opens new avenues for development of materials for load&#8208;bearing applications from self&#8208;adaptive capabilities.








Abstract
Natural structural materials, such as bone, can autonomously modulate their mechanical properties in response to external loading to prevent failure. These material systems smartly control the addition/removal of material in locations of high/low mechanical stress by utilizing local resources guided by biological signals. On the contrary, synthetic structural materials have unchanging mechanical properties limiting their mechanical performance and service life. Inspired by the mineralization process of bone, a material system that adapts its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading is reported. It is found that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization from surrounding media. It is shown that the material system can adapt to external mechanical loading by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the stress and the resulting piezoelectric charges. Moreover, the mineralization mechanism allows a simple one&#8208;step route for fabricating functionally graded materials by controlling the stress distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class of self&#8208;regenerating materials that reinforce regions of high stress or induce deposition of minerals on the damaged areas from the increase in mechanical stress to prevent/mitigate failure. It is envisioned that the findings can contribute to addressing the current challenges of synthetic materials for load&#8208;bearing applications from self&#8208;adaptive capabilities.

      <title>Nanoscale&#8208;Dewetting&#8208;Based Direct Interconnection of Microelectronics for a Deterministic Assembly of Transfer Printing</title>
      <dc:description>
The stability and wettability of coated polymer adhesive with indium (In) particles or gold&#8208;deposited substrates can be controlled by modulating the thickness of the adhesive. The In particles dispersed in the polymer adhesive, or the protruding structures of the substrate, easily trigger dewetting of the polymer adhesive, and form a vertical interconnection of the electronics and the substrate via deterministic assembly.








Abstract
As electronics dramatically advance, their components should be fabricated for miniaturized scale, and integrated on limited&#8208;size substrates with extremely high density. Current technologies for the integration and interconnection of electronics show some critical limitations in the application of microscale electronics. To address these problems, herein, a new direct and vertical interconnection driven by selective dewetting of a polymer adhesive is introduced. The interconnection system consists of the polymer adhesive and nanosized metal particles, or structured electrodes. Nanoscale&#8208;dewetting windows formed by controlling the stability and wetting property of the adhesive polymer are controlled by the interfacial property of the coated polymer adhesive. The adhesive is coated on substrate by a simple spin&#8208;coating process, and its ultraviolet curable property allows only the device&#8208;mounted parts to be selectively conductive and sticky, while the other parts form insulation and protection layers. The interconnection of the electronics and substrate by adhesive makes it possible to apply the technique to various microsize electronics with electrode size and pitch of 20 &#181;m or less, and endure dramatic temperature change and a long&#8208;term high humidity environment. Moreover, over display comprising over 10 000 microscale light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs), and commercialized microchips are demonstrated with monolithic integration on flexible and transparent substrate.

      <title>Progress in Brain&#8208;Compatible Interfaces with Soft Nanomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible&#8208;material&#8208;based flexible electronics have great potential for use in neuromedical system due to the possibility of neural&#8208;interface communication between the brain and machines. Recent developments regarding in vivo neuromodulation are introduced, including flexible reading/writing/drug&#8208;delivery devices, self&#8208;powered deep&#8208;brain stimulators, and closed&#8208;loop control systems.








Abstract
Neural interfaces facilitating communication between the brain and machines must be compatible with the soft, curvilinear, and elastic tissues of the brain and yet yield enough power to read and write information across a wide range of brain areas through high&#8208;throughput recordings or optogenetics. Biocompatible&#8208;material engineering has facilitated the development of brain&#8208;compatible neural interfaces to support built&#8208;in modulation of neural circuits and neurological disorders. Recent developments in brain&#8208;compatible neural interfaces that use soft nanomaterials more suitable for complex neural circuit analysis and modulation are reviewed. Preclinical tests of the compatibility and specificity of these interfaces in animal models are also discussed.

      <title>Emerging Self&#8208;Emissive Technologies for Flexible Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
The progress of self&#8208;emissive techniques for flexible displays is reviewed, beginning with emitting active materials and device fabrication technologies, followed by flexible substrates, transparent electrodes, and encapsulation, and then the rapid development of the performance of devices.








Abstract
Featuring a combination of ultrathin and lightweight properties, excellent mechanical flexibility, low power&#8208;consumption, and widely tunable saturated emission, flexible displays have opened up a new possibility for optoelectronics. The demands for flexible displays are growing on a continual basis due not only to their successful commercialization but, more importantly, their endless possibilities for wearable integrated systems. Up to now, self&#8208;emissive technologies for displays, flexible active&#8208;matrix organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (flex&#8208;AMOLED), flexible quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (flex&#8208;QLEDs), and flexible perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (flex&#8208;PeLEDs) have been widely reported, but despite the significant progress made in these technologies, enormous obstacles and challenges remain for the vision of truly wearable applications, in particular with flex&#8208;QLEDs and flex&#8208;PeLEDs. Here, a review of the recent progress of all three self&#8208;emissive technologies for flexible displays is conducted, including the emissive active materials, device structures and approaches to manufacturing, the flexible substrates, and conductive electrodes, as well as the encapsulation techniques. The fast&#8208;paced improvement made to the efficiency of flexible devices in recent years is also summarized. The review concludes by making suggestions on the future development in this area, and is expected to help researchers in gaining a comprehensive understanding about the newly emerging technologies for flexible displays.

      <title>When Bio Meets Technology: Biohybrid Neural Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Electronics capable of interfacing with the nervous system are rapidly evolving. Biohybrid implants represent a new type of neural interface, combining implantable electrodes technology and cell transplantation. An overview of biohybrid interfaces, with a classification based on the host anatomical location is provided. A summary of the key challenges and the potential future research directions are also presented.








Abstract
The development of electronics capable of interfacing with the nervous system is a rapidly advancing field with applications in basic science and clinical translation. Devices containing arrays of electrodes can be used in the study of cells grown in culture or can be implanted into damaged or dysfunctional tissue to restore normal function. While devices are typically designed and used exclusively for one of these two purposes, there have been increasing efforts in developing implantable electrode arrays capable of housing cultured cells, referred to as biohybrid implants. Once implanted, the cells within these implants integrate into the tissue, serving as a mediator of the electrode&#8211;tissue interface. This biological component offers unique advantages to these implant designs, providing better tissue integration and potentially long&#8208;term stability. Herein, an overview of current research into biohybrid devices, as well as the historical background that led to their development are provided, based on the host anatomical location for which they are designed (CNS, PNS, or special senses). Finally, a summary of the key challenges of this technology and potential future research directions are presented.

      <title>A New Frontier of Printed Electronics: Flexible Hybrid Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) with applications in wearable health, structural health, and industrial, environmental, and agricultural sensing are reviewed. The recent progress, fabrication, application, and challenges, and an outlook, relating to FHE are presented with a focus on the fundamental building blocks of FHE systems: printed sensors and circuits, thinned silicon integrated circuits, printed antennas, printed energy harvesting and storage modules, and printed displays.








Abstract
The performance and integration density of silicon integrated circuits (ICs) have progressed at an unprecedented pace in the past 60 years. While silicon ICs thrive at low&#8208;power high&#8208;performance computing, creating flexible and large&#8208;area electronics using silicon remains a challenge. On the other hand, flexible and printed electronics use intrinsically flexible materials and printing techniques to manufacture compliant and large&#8208;area electronics. Nonetheless, flexible electronics are not as efficient as silicon ICs for computation and signal communication. Flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) leverages the strengths of these two dissimilar technologies. It uses flexible and printed electronics where flexibility and scalability are required, i.e., for sensing and actuating, and silicon ICs for computation and communication purposes. Combining flexible electronics and silicon ICs yields a very powerful and versatile technology with a vast range of applications. Here, the fundamental building blocks of an FHE system, printed sensors and circuits, thinned silicon ICs, printed antennas, printed energy harvesting and storage modules, and printed displays, are discussed. Emerging application areas of FHE in wearable health, structural health, industrial, environmental, and agricultural sensing are reviewed. Overall, the recent progress, fabrication, application, and challenges, and an outlook, related to FHE are presented.

      <title>Organic Photodetectors for Next&#8208;Generation Wearable Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Photodetectors based on organic materials are promising devices for wearable applications due to their mechanical flexibility, ease of processing, tunable optoelectronic properties, good light&#8208;sensing performance, and biocompatibility. Recent advances of organic photodetectors in terms of both optoelectronic and mechanical properties are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation wearable electronics will need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable such that they can be conformally attached onto the human body. Photodetectors that are available in today's market are based on rigid inorganic crystalline materials and they have limited mechanical flexibility. In contrast, photodetectors based on organic polymers and molecules have emerged as promising alternatives due to their inherent mechanical softness, ease of processing, tunable optoelectronic properties, good light sensing performance, and biocompatibility. Here, the recent advances of organic photodetectors in terms of both optoelectronic and mechanical properties are outlined and discussed, and their application in wearable electronics including health monitoring sensors, artificial vision, and self&#8208;powering integrated devices are highlighted.

      <title>The Future of Neuroimplantable Devices: A Materials Science and Regulatory Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in the development of existing neuroimplantable devices such as electrocorticography (ECoG) systems, multielectrode arrays (MEAs), Stentrode, and deep brain probes is reviewed. Furthermore, the materials science and regulatory perspective on such devices, with regard to their relationship with biological, mechanical, and material risk factors, are highlighted.








Abstract
The past two decades have seen unprecedented progress in the development of novel materials, form factors, and functionalities in neuroimplantable technologies, including electrocorticography (ECoG) systems, multielectrode arrays (MEAs), Stentrode, and deep brain probes. The key considerations for the development of such devices intended for acute implantation and chronic use, from the perspective of biocompatible hybrid materials incorporation, conformable device design, implantation procedures, and mechanical and biological risk factors, are highlighted. These topics are connected with the role that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays in its regulation of neuroimplantable technologies based on the above parameters. Existing neuroimplantable devices and efforts to improve their materials and implantation protocols are first discussed in detail. The effects of device implantation with regards to biocompatibility and brain heterogeneity are then explored. Topics examined include brain&#8208;specific risk factors, such as bacterial infection, tissue scarring, inflammation, and vasculature damage, as well as efforts to manage these dangers through emerging hybrid, bioelectronic device architectures. The current challenges of gaining clinical approval by the FDA&#8212;in particular, with regards to biological, mechanical, and materials risk factors&#8212;are summarized. The available regulatory pathways to accelerate next&#8208;generation neuroimplantable devices to market are then discussed.

The key considerations for the development of such devices intended for acute implantation and chronic use, from the perspective of biocompatible hybrid materials incorporation, conformable device design, implantation procedures, and mechanical and biological risk factors, are highlighted. These topics are connected with the role that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays in its regulation of neuroimplantable technologies based on the above parameters. Existing neuroimplantable devices and efforts to improve their materials and implantation protocols are first discussed in detail. The effects of device implantation with regards to biocompatibility and brain heterogeneity are then explored. Topics examined include brain&#8208;specific risk factors, such as bacterial infection, tissue scarring, inflammation, and vasculature damage, as well as efforts to manage these dangers through emerging hybrid, bioelectronic device architectures. The current challenges of gaining clinical approval by the FDA&#8212;in particular, with regards to biological, mechanical, and materials risk factors&#8212;are summarized. The available regulatory pathways to accelerate next&#8208;generation neuroimplantable devices to market are then discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics for Computing, Soft Robotics, and Neuroprosthetics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible neuromorphic electronics are studied for their application in next&#8208;generation wearable computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. These applications require synaptic devices and integrated systems that are flexible, consume little power, are biocompatible, and are amenable to high&#8208;density integration. Recent progress in flexible neuromorphic electronics, from basic background to applications is surveyed, and future research is suggested.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic electronics that emulate biological neuronal systems constitute a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation wearable computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. For realization, with the achievement of simple synaptic behaviors in a single device, the construction of artificial synapses with various functions of sensing and responding and integrated systems to mimic complicated computing, sensing, and responding in biological systems is a prerequisite. Artificial synapses that have learning ability can perceive and react to events in the real world; these abilities expand the neuromorphic applications toward health monitoring and cybernetic devices in the future Internet of Things. To demonstrate the flexible neuromorphic systems successfully, it is essential to develop artificial synapses and nerves replicating the functionalities of the biological counterparts and satisfying the requirements for constructing the elements and the integrated systems such as flexibility, low power consumption, high&#8208;density integration, and biocompatibility. Here, the progress of flexible neuromorphic electronics is addressed, from basic backgrounds including synaptic characteristics, device structures, and mechanisms of artificial synapses and nerves, to applications for computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. Finally, future research directions toward wearable artificial neuromorphic systems are suggested for this emerging area.

      <title>Wireless Monitoring Using a Stretchable and Transparent Sensor Sheet Containing Metal Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Optically and mechanically imperceptible sensor sheets that allow the wireless monitoring of biological signals to obtain low&#8208;noise measurements are discussed. This includes effective improvement methods for a Ag&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based track in terms of transparency, stretchability, reliability, and miniaturization with treatments, such as nanolevel Au plating. In addition, an organic amplifier is explored toward a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.








Abstract
Mechanically and visually imperceptible sensor sheets integrated with lightweight wireless loggers are employed in ultimate flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) to reduce vital stress/nervousness and monitor natural biosignal responses. The key technologies and applications for conceptual sensor system fabrication are reported, as exemplified by the use of a stretchable sensor sheet completely conforming to an individual's body surface to realize a low&#8208;noise wireless monitoring system (&lt;1 &#181;V) that can be attached to the human forehead for recording electroencephalograms. The above system can discriminate between Alzheimer's disease and the healthy state, thus offering a rapid in&#8208;home brain diagnosis possibility. Moreover, the introduction of metal nanowires to improve the transparency of the biocompatible sensor sheet allows one to wirelessly acquire electrocorticograms of nonhuman primates and simultaneously offers optogenetic stimulation such as toward&#8208;the&#8208;brain&#8211;machine interface under free movement. Also discussed are effective methods of improving electrical reliability, biocompatibility, miniaturization, etc., for metal nanowire based tracks and exploring the use of an organic amplifier as an important component to realize a flexible active probe with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Overall, ultimate FHE technologies are demonstrated to achieve efficient closed&#8208;loop systems for healthcare management, medical diagnostics, and preclinical studies in neuroscience and neuroengineering.

      <title>3D Self&#8208;Assembled Microelectronic Devices: Concepts, Materials, Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Conventional microelectronics have difficulties accommodating a number of 3D electronic components. Self&#8208;assembled 3D architectures are gradually brought into the field of microelectronics realizing 3D self&#8208;assembled passive, active, sensory, mechanical and energy&#8208;supply devices. The emerging compatibility among different technologies and novel materials defines the onset for fully parallel wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of 3D self&#8208;assembled microelectronic systems.








Abstract
Modern microelectronic systems and their components are essentially 3D devices that have become smaller and lighter in order to improve performance and reduce costs. To maintain this trend, novel materials and technologies are required that provide more structural freedom in 3D over conventional microelectronics, as well as easier parallel fabrication routes while maintaining compatability with existing manufacturing methods. Self&#8208;assembly of initially planar membranes into complex 3D architectures offers a wealth of opportunities to accommodate thin&#8208;film microelectronic functionalities in devices and systems possessing improved performance and higher integration density. Existing work in this field, with a focus on components constructed from 3D self&#8208;assembly, is reviewed, and an outlook on their application potential in tomorrow's microelectronics world is provided.

Strategies that allow spatial integration of 3D stretchable device configurations are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and open opportunities are provided.








Abstract
Over the past decade, the area of stretchable inorganic electronics has evolved very rapidly, in part because the results have opened up a series of unprecedented applications with broad interest and potential for impact, especially in bio&#8208;integrated systems. Low modulus mechanics and the ability to accommodate extreme mechanical deformations, especially high levels of stretching, represent key defining characteristics. Most existing studies exploit structural material designs to achieve these properties, through the integration of hard inorganic electronic components configured into strategic 2D/3D geometries onto patterned soft substrates. The diverse structural geometries developed for stretchable inorganic electronics are summarized, covering the designs of functional devices and soft substrates, with a focus on fundamental principles, design approaches, and system demonstrations. Strategies that allow spatial integration of 3D stretchable device layouts are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives on the remaining challenges and open opportunities are provided.

Abstract
Wearable electronics have revolutionized the way physiological parameters are sensed, detected, and monitored. In recent years, advances in flexible and stretchable hybrid electronics have created emergent properties that enhance the compliance of devices to our skin. With their unobtrusive attributes, skin conformable sensors enable applications toward real&#8208;time disease diagnosis and continuous healthcare monitoring. Herein, critical perspectives of flexible hybrid electronics toward the future of digital health monitoring are provided, emphasizing its role in physiological sensing. In particular, the strategies within the sensor composition to render flexibility and stretchability while maintaining excellent sensing performance are considered. Next, novel approaches to the functionalization of the sensor for physical or biochemical stimuli are extensively covered. Subsequently, wearable sensors measuring physical parameters such as strain, pressure, temperature, as well as biological changes in metabolites and electrolytes are reported. Finally, their implications toward early disease detection and monitoring are discussed, concluding with a future perspective into the challenges and opportunities in emerging wearable sensor designs for the next few years.

      <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy of III&#8208;Nitride Semiconductors Based on 2D Materials for Flexible Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) is presently the most promising strategy to obtain flexible III&#8208;nitride (opto)electronic devices based on sp2&#8208;bonded two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials. Recent progress in the fabrication of 2D materials, vdWE, and transfer printing of III&#8208;nitride films based on graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides is reviewed, and key points and future perspectives are discussed.








Abstract
III&#8208;nitride semiconductors have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their excellent physical properties and wide applications in solid&#8208;state lighting, flat&#8208;panel displays, and solar energy and power electronics. Generally, GaN&#8208;based devices are heteroepitaxially grown on c&#8208;plane sapphire, Si (111), or 6H&#8208;SiC substrates. However, it is very difficult to release the GaN&#8208;based films from such single&#8208;crystalline substrates and transfer them onto other foreign substrates. Consequently, it is difficult to meet the ever&#8208;increasing demand for wearable and foldable applications. On the other hand, sp2&#8208;bonded two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, which exhibit hexagonal in&#8208;plane lattice arrangements and weakly bonded layers, can be transferred onto flexible substrates with ease. Hence, flexible III&#8208;nitride devices can be implemented through such 2D release layers. In this progress report, the recent advances in the different strategies for the growth of III&#8208;nitrides based on 2D materials are reviewed, with a focus on van der Waals epitaxy and transfer printing. Various attempts are presented and discussed herein, including the different kinds of 2D materials (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides) used as release layers. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development of flexible III&#8208;nitride devices are discussed.

      <title>Conformable Hybrid Systems for Implantable Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformable hybrid systems for implantable bioelectronic interfaces enable safe diagnosis and therapy inside the body. Combining soft materials and high&#8208;performance electronics within thin&#8208;films or engineered form factors enables complex devices that can read/write into organs and tissues with unmet precision. Recent advances in materials science, micro/nanofabrication, packaging, and biomedical engineering are analyzed. Current challenges are highlighted with possible future solutions.








Abstract
Conformable bioelectronic systems are promising tools that may aid the understanding of diseases, alleviate pathological symptoms such as chronic pain, heart arrhythmia, and dysfunctions, and assist in reversing conditions such as deafness, blindness, and paralysis. Combining reduced invasiveness with advanced electronic functions, hybrid bioelectronic systems have evolved tremendously in the last decade, pushed by progress in materials science, micro&#8208; and nanofabrication, system assembly and packaging, and biomedical engineering. Hybrid integration refers here to a technological approach to embed within mechanically compliant carrier substrates electronic components and circuits prepared with traditional electronic materials. This combination leverages mechanical and electronic performance of polymer substrates and device materials, respectively, and offers many opportunities for man&#8208;made systems to communicate with the body with unmet precision. However, trade&#8208;offs between materials selection, manufacturing processes, resolution, electrical function, mechanical integrity, biointegration, and reliability should be considered. Herein, prominent trends in manufacturing conformable hybrid systems are analyzed and key design, function, and validation principles are outlined together with the remaining challenges to produce reliable conformable, hybrid bioelectronic systems.

A soft&#8211;hard interface design is crucial for the construction of next&#8208;generation thin, soft, lightweight, multifunctional, and skin&#8208;conformal hybrid electronic devices. A series of materials and structural designs, including macroscopic human&#8211;device interfaces, microscale structural interfaces, nanoscale interfaces, and molecular&#8208;scale interfaces, is reviewed to advance technologies for the seamless integration of soft electronics with the human body.








Abstract
Emerging next&#8208;generation soft electronics will require versatile properties functioning under mechanical compliance, which will involve the use of different types of materials. As a result, control over material interfaces (particularly soft/hard interfaces) has become crucial and is now attracting intensive worldwide research efforts. A series of material and structural interface designs has been devised to improve interfacial adhesion, preventing failure of electromechanical properties under mechanical deformation. Herein, different soft/hard interface design strategies at multiple length scales in the context of flexible hybrid electronics are reviewed. The crucial role of soft ligands and/or polymers in controlling the morphologies of active nanomaterials and stabilizing them is discussed, with a focus on understanding the soft/hard interface at the atomic/molecular scale. Larger nanoscopic and microscopic levels are also discussed, to scrutinize viable intrinsic and extrinsic interfacial designs with the purpose of promoting adhesion, stretchability, and durability. Furthermore, the macroscopic device/human interface as it relates to real&#8208;world applications is analyzed. Finally, a perspective on the current challenges and future opportunities in the development of truly seamlessly integrated soft wearable electronic systems is presented.

Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;enabled flexible and stretchable electronics have seen tremendous progress in recent years, evolving from single sensors to integrated sensing systems. Compared with nanomaterial&#8208;enabled sensors with a single function, integration of multiple sensors is conducive to comprehensive monitoring of personal health and environment, intelligent human&#8211;machine interfaces, and realistic imitation of human skin in robotics and prosthetics. Integration of sensors with other functional components promotes real&#8208;world applications of the sensing systems. Here, an overview of the design and integration strategies and manufacturing techniques for such sensing systems is given. Then, representative nanomaterial&#8208;enabled flexible and stretchable sensing systems are presented. Following that, representative applications in personal health, fitness tracking, electronic skins, artificial nervous systems, and human&#8211;machine interactions are provided. To conclude, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field are considered.

      <title>Rubbery Electronics Fully Made of Stretchable Elastomeric Electronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Compared to conventional rigid and bulky electronics, stretchable electronics have substantial advantages for various situations where large mechanical deformations are required. Recent progress shows stretchable electronics from all rubber&#8208;like components are excellent candidates to substitute electronics developed using architectural engineering for eliminating strain. The current development in rubbery electronics is reviewed and future directions for the field are suggested.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics outperform existing rigid and bulky electronics and benefit a wide range of species, including humans, machines, and robots, whose activities are associated with large mechanical deformation and strain. Due to the nonstretchable nature of most electronic materials, in particular semiconductors, stretchable electronics are mostly realized through the strategies of architectural engineering to accommodate mechanical stretching rather than imposing strain into the materials directly. On the other hand, recent development of stretchable electronics by creating them entirely from stretchable elastomeric electronic materials, i.e., rubbery electronics, suggests a feasible a venue. Rubbery electronics have gained increasing interest due to the unique advantages that they and their associated manufacturing technologies have offered. This work reviews the recent progress in developing rubbery electronics, including the crucial stretchable elastomeric materials of rubbery conductors, rubbery semiconductors, and rubbery dielectrics. Thereafter, various rubbery electronics such as rubbery transistors, integrated electronics, rubbery optoelectronic devices, and rubbery sensors are discussed.

Abstract
Advances in printing materials and techniques for flexible and hybrid electronics in the domain of connected healthcare have enabled rapid development of innovative body&#8208;interfaced health monitoring systems at a tremendous pace. Thin, flexible, and stretchable biosensors that are printed on a biocompatible soft substrate provide the ability to noninvasively and unobtrusively integrate with the human body for continuous monitoring and early detection of diseases and other conditions affecting health and well being. Hybrid integration of such biosensors with extremely well&#8208;established silicon&#8208;based microcircuit chips offers a viable route for in&#8208;sensor data processing and wireless transmission in many medical and clinical settings. Here, a set of advanced and hybrid printing techniques is summarized, covering diverse aspects ranging from active electronic materials to process capability, for their use in human skin and eye&#8208;interfaced health monitoring systems with different levels of complexity. Essential components of the devices, including constituent biomaterials, structural layouts, assembly methods, and power and data processing configurations, are outlined and discussed in a categorized manner tailored to specific clinical needs. Perspectives on the benefits and challenges of these systems in basic and applied biomedical research are presented and discussed.

Transferring the biological concept of sensory memory into electronic implementation is promising to achieve perceptual intelligence. Recent endeavors on design, fabrication, and application of artificial sensory memory are summarized. Such a device would undoubtedly shed light on future advances with respect to various translational implementations such as robotics and prosthetics.








Abstract
Sensory memory, formed at the beginning while perceiving and interacting with the environment, is considered a primary source of intelligence. Transferring such biological concepts into electronic implementation aims at achieving perceptual intelligence, which would profoundly advance a broad spectrum of applications, such as prosthetics, robotics, and cyborg systems. Here, the recent developments in the design and fabrication of artificial sensory memory devices are summarized and their applications in recognition, manipulation, and learning are highlighted. The emergence of such devices benefits from recent progress in both bioinspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering technologies and derives from abundant inspiration and benchmarks from an improved understanding of biological sensory processing. Increasing attention to this area would offer unprecedented opportunities toward new hardware architecture of artificial intelligence, which could extend the capabilities of digital systems with emotional/psychological attributes. Pending challenges are also addressed to aspects such as integration level, energy efficiency, and functionality, which would undoubtedly shed light on the future development of translational implementations.

The latest research developments and progress regarding material&#8208;based approaches for the fabrication of stretchable electronics are comprehensively reviewed. Detailed descriptions of various stretchable conducting/semiconducting composites are given, along with their electrical/mechanical properties, material processing strategies, and examples of device applications. In addition, the outlook for future research in this field is discussed.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics are mechanically compatible with a variety of objects, especially with the soft curvilinear contours of the human body, enabling human&#8208;friendly electronics applications that could not be achieved with conventional rigid electronics. Therefore, extensive research effort has been devoted to the development of stretchable electronics, from research on materials and unit device, to fully integrated systems. In particular, material&#8208;processing technologies that encompass the synthesis, assembly, and patterning of intrinsically stretchable electronic materials have been actively investigated and have provided many notable breakthroughs for the advancement of stretchable electronics. Here, the latest studies of such material&#8208;based approaches are reviewed, mainly focusing on intrinsically stretchable electronic nanocomposites that generally consist of conducting/semiconducting filler materials inside or on elastomer backbone matrices. Various approaches for fabricating these intrinsically stretchable electronic materials are presented, including the blending of electronic fillers into elastomer matrices, the formation of bi&#8208;layered heterogeneous electronic&#8208;layer and elastomer support&#8208;layer structures, and modifications to polymeric molecular structures in order to impart stretchability. Detailed descriptions of the various conducting/semiconducting composites prepared by each method are provided, along with their electrical/mechanical properties and examples of device applications.

      <dc:description>
The combination of flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistors and biomimetics holds great potential for application for the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. Strategies to obtain flexible OFETs are reviewed. Research on biomimetic sensory systems and nervous systems are discussed in detail.

Abstract
The emergence of flexible organic electronics that span the fields of physics and biomimetics creates the possibility for increasingly simple and intelligent products for use in everyday life. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), with their inherent flexibility, light weight, and biocompatibility, have shown great promise in the field of biomimicry. By applying such biomimetic OFETs for the internet of things (IoT) makes it possible to imagine novel products and use cases for the future. Recent advances in flexible OFETs and their applications in biomimetic systems are reviewed. Strategies to achieve flexible OFETs are individually discussed and recent progress in biomimetic sensory systems and nervous systems is reviewed in detail. OFETs are revealed to be one of the best systems for mimicking sensory and nervous systems. Additionally, a brief discussion of information storage based on OFETs is presented. Finally, a personal view of the utilization of biomimetic OFETs in the IoT and future challenges in this research area are provided.

      <title>Flexible and Stretchable Antennas for Biointegrated Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable antennas are critical components of wireless, biointegrated electronics. An overview of material choices and design strategies is provided. Optimization methods and performance characteristics are considered for a range of applications, with an emphasis on wearable devices. The antennas can support data transmission, external control interfaces, power harvesting, and can also function as sensors of mechanical deformations.








Abstract
Combined advances in material science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering form the foundations of thin, soft electronic/optoelectronic platforms that have unique capabilities in wireless monitoring and control of various biological processes in cells, tissues, and organs. Miniaturized, stretchable antennas represent an essential link between such devices and external systems for control, power delivery, data processing, and/or communication. Applications typically involve a demanding set of considerations in performance, size, and stretchability. Some of the most effective strategies rely on unusual materials such as liquid metals, nanowires, and woven textiles or on optimally configured 2D/3D structures such as serpentines and helical coils of conventional materials. In the best cases, the performance metrics of small, stretchable, radio frequency (RF) antennas realized using these strategies compare favorably to those of traditional devices. Examples range from dipole, monopole, and patch antennas for far&#8208;field RF operation, to magnetic loop antennas for near&#8208;field communication (NFC), where the key parameters include operating frequency, Q factor, radiation pattern, and reflection coefficient S11 across a range of mechanical deformations and cyclic loads. Despite significant progress over the last several years, many challenges and associated research opportunities remain in the development of high&#8208;efficiency antennas for biointegrated electronic/optoelectronic systems.

      <title>Trace&#8208;Level, Multi&#8208;Gas Detection for Food Quality Assessment Based on Decorated Silicon Transistor Arrays</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiplexed gas sensors for monitoring food freshness can potentially limit food waste and promote safe consumption. Integrated arrays of silicon&#8208;based, chemical&#8208;sensitive field&#8208;effect transistors are presented to monitor gases typically associated with food spoilage, including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and humidity. These sensors are integrated into a compact and portable platform envisioned for integration into smart fridges to assess food quality dynamically.








Abstract
Multiplexed gas detection at room temperature is critical for practical applications, such as for tracking the complex chemical environments associated with food decomposition and spoilage. An integrated array of multiple silicon&#8208;based, chemical&#8208;sensitive field effect transistors (CSFETs) is presented to realize selective, sensitive, and simultaneous measurement of gases typically associated with food spoilage. CSFETs decorated with sensing materials based on ruthenium, silver, and silicon oxide are used to obtain stable room&#8208;temperature responses to ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and humidity, respectively. For example, one multi&#8208;CSFET sensor signal changes from its baseline by 13.34 in response to 1 ppm of NH3, 724.45 under 1 ppm H2S, and 23.46 under 80% relative humidity, with sensitive detection down to 10 ppb of NH3 and H2S. To demonstrate this sensor for practical applications, the CSFET sensor array is combined with a custom&#8208;printed circuit board into a compact, fully integrated, and portable system to conduct real&#8208;time monitoring of gases generated by decomposing food. By using existing silicon&#8208;based manufacturing methodologies, this room&#8208;temperature gas sensing array can be fabricated reproducibly and at low cost, making it an attractive platform for ambient gas measurement needed in food safety applications.

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Modulated Excess PbI2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells generally consist of an excess of lead iodide (PbI2) as passivator. In this work, ligand&#8208;modulation technology is demonstrated to fabricate vertically distributed PbI2 nanosheets between the perovskite grain boundaries, which enhances the passivation effect of PbI2 and improves the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Excess lead iodide (PbI2), as a defect passivation material in perovskite films, contributes to the longer carrier lifetime and reduced halide vacancies for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, the random distribution of excess PbI2 also leads to accelerated degradation of the perovskite layer. Inspired by nanocrystal synthesis, here, a universal ligand&#8208;modulation technology is developed to modulate the shape and distribution of excess PbI2 in perovskite films. By adding certain ligands, perovskite films with vertically distributed PbI2 nanosheets between the grain boundaries are successfully achieved, which reduces the nonradiative recombination and trap density of the perovskite layer. Thus, the power conversion efficiency of the modulated device increases from 20% to 22% compared to the control device. In addition, benefiting from the vertical distribution of excess PbI2 and the hydrophobic nature of the surface ligands, the modulated devices exhibit much longer stability, retaining 72% of their initial efficiency after 360 h constant illumination under maximum power point tracking measurement.

      <title>Somatosensory, Light&#8208;Driven, Thin&#8208;Film Robots Capable of Integrated Perception and Motility</title>
      <dc:description>
Somatosensory light&#8208;driven robots (SLiRs) are devised using a smart thin&#8208;film composite that tightly integrates actuation and multisensing. An SLiR subsumes pyro/piezoelectric responses and piezoresistive strain sensation under a photoactuator transducer, enabling simultaneous yet non&#8208;interfering perception of its body temperature and actuation deformation states. The compact thin film, when combined with kirigami, facilitates rapid customization of morphable robotic functionalities and somatosensory receptions.








Abstract
Living organisms are capable of sensing and responding to their environment through reflex&#8208;driven pathways. The grand challenge for mimicking such natural intelligence in miniature robots lies in achieving highly integrated body functionality, actuation, and sensing mechanisms. Here, somatosensory light&#8208;driven robots (SLiRs) based on a smart thin&#8208;film composite tightly integrating actuation and multisensing are presented. The SLiR subsumes pyro/piezoelectric responses and piezoresistive strain sensation under a photoactuator transducer, enabling simultaneous yet non&#8208;interfering perception of its body temperature and actuation deformation states. The compact thin film, when combined with kirigami, facilitates rapid customization of low&#8208;profile structures for morphable, mobile, and multiple robotic functionality. For example, an SLiR walker can move forward on different surfaces, while providing feedback on its detailed locomotive gaits and subtle terrain textures, and an SLiR anthropomorphic hand shows bodily senses arising from concerted mechanoreception, thermoreception, proprioception, and photoreception. Untethered operation with an SLiR centipede is also demonstrated, which can execute distinct, localized body functions from directional motility, multisensing, to wireless human and environment interactions. This SLiR, which is capable of integrated perception and motility, offers new opportunities for developing diverse intelligent behaviors in soft robots.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Fluorinated Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptor with 3D Stacking and Exciton/Charge Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
A fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor FINIC with fluorination of both end groups and side chains is designed and synthesized, and compared with its nonfluorinated analogue INIC. FINIC exhibits 3D molecular stacking, exciton transport and charge transport. FINIC&#8208;based organic solar cells yield an efficiency of 14.0%, far exceeding that of the INIC&#8208;based devices (5.1%).








Abstract
A new fluorinated electron acceptor (FINIC) based on 6,6,12,12&#8208;tetrakis(3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hexylphenyl)&#8208;indacenobis(dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) as the electron&#8208;donating central core and 5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;(1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene)&#8208;1&#8208;indanone as the electron&#8208;deficient end groups is rationally designed and synthesized. FINIC shows similar absorption profile in dilute solution to the nonfluorinated analogue INIC. However, compared with INIC, FINIC film shows red&#8208;shifted absorption, down&#8208;shifted frontier molecular orbital energy levels, enhanced crystallinity, and more ordered molecular packing. Single&#8208;crystal structure data show that FINIC molecules pack into closer 3D &#8220;network&#8221; motif through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, while INIC molecules pack into incompact &#8220;honeycomb&#8221; motif through only &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Theoretical calculations reveal that FINIC has stronger electronic coupling and more molecular interactions than INIC. FINIC has higher electron mobilities in both horizontal and vertical directions than INIC. Moreover, FINIC and INIC support efficient 3D exciton transport. PBD&#8208;SF/FINIC blend has a larger driving force for exciton splitting, more efficient charge transfer and photoinduced charge generation. Finally, the organic solar cells based on PBD&#8208;SF/FINIC blend yield power conversion efficiency of 14.0%, far exceeding that of the PBD&#8208;SF/INIC&#8208;based devices (5.1%).

      <title>Scanning Probing of the Tribovoltaic Effect at the Sliding Interface of Two Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
A tribo&#8208;current is generated by sliding an N&#8208;type diamond coated tip on a P&#8208;type Si wafer. It is suggested that the tribocurrent is induced by the tribovoltaic effect, in which electron&#8211;hole pairs at the sliding interface are excited by the energy release during friction, and are subsequently separated by the built&#8208;in electric field at the PN heterojunction, resulting in tribo&#8208;current.








Abstract
Contact electrification (CE or triboelectrification) is a common phenomenon, which can occur for almost all types of materials. In previous studies, the CE between insulators and metals has been widely discussed, while CE involving semiconductors is only recently. Here, a tribo&#8208;current is generated by sliding an N&#8208;type diamond coated tip on a P&#8208;type or N&#8208;type Si wafers. The density of surface states of the Si wafer is changed by introducing different densities of doping. It is found that the tribo&#8208;current between two sliding semiconductors increases with increasing density of surface states of the semiconductor and the sliding load. The results suggest that the tribo&#8208;current is induced by the tribovoltaic effect, in which the electron&#8211;hole pairs at the sliding interface are excited by the energy release during friction, which may be due to the transition of electrons between the surface states during contact, or bond formation across the sliding interface. The electron&#8211;hole pairs at the sliding interface are subsequently separated by the built&#8208;in electric field at the PN or NN heterojunctions, which results in a tribo&#8208;current, in analogy to that which occurs in the photovoltaic effect.

      <title>Recent Progress on Cellulose&#8208;Based Ionic Compounds for Biomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds as either polymeric cellulose derivatives or ionic nanocellulose have gained tremendous attention within the last years due to their remarkable properties, especially their biological properties. Recent advances about various ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds with diverse functional moieties either along the cellulose chains or on the surface of nanocellulose for biomedical applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Glycans play important roles in all major kingdoms of organisms, such as archea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Cellulose, the most abundant polysaccharide on the Earth, plays a predominant role for mechanical stability in plants, and finds a plethora of applications by humans. Beyond traditional use, biomedical application of cellulose becomes feasible with advances of soluble cellulose derivatives with diverse functional moieties along the backbone and modified nanocellulose with versatile functional groups on the surface due to the native features of cellulose as both cellulose chains and supramolecular ordered domains as extractable nanocellulose. With the focus on ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds involving both these groups primarily for biomedical applications, a brief introduction about glycoscience and especially native biologically active glycosaminoglycans with specific biomedical application areas on humans is given, which inspires further development of bioactive compounds from glycans. Then, both polymeric cellulose derivatives and nanocellulose&#8208;based compounds synthesized as versatile biomaterials for a large variety of biomedical applications, such as for wound dressings, controlled release, encapsulation of cells and enzymes, and tissue engineering, are separately described, regarding the diverse routes of synthesis and the established and suggested applications for these highly interesting materials.

      <title>Highly Efficient All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Appropriate Active Layer Morphology by Side Chain Engineering of Donor Molecules and Thermal Annealing</title>
      <dc:description>
The active layer morphology of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (SM&#8208;OSCs) is tuned by side chain engineering of the donor molecules and thermal annealing (TA) of the devices. An SM&#8208;OSC based on A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;structured SM1&#8208;F with fluorine and alkyl substituents as the donor and Y6 as the acceptor, and with TA, demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency of 14.07%.








Abstract
It is very important to fine&#8208;tune the nanoscale morphology of donor:acceptor blend active layers for improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (SM&#8208;OSCs). In this work, two new small molecule donor materials are synthesized with different substituents on their thiophene conjugated side chains, including SM1&#8208;S with alkylthio and SM1&#8208;F with fluorine and alkyl substituents, and the previously reported donor molecule SM1 with an alkyl substituent, for investigating the effect of different conjugated side chains on the molecular aggregation and the photophysical, and photovoltaic properties of the donor molecules. As a result, an SM1&#8208;F&#8208;based SM&#8208;OSC with Y6 as the acceptor, and with thermal annealing (TA) at 120 &#176;C for 10 min, demonstrates the highest power conversion efficiency value of 14.07%, which is one of the best values for SM&#8208;OSCs reported so far. Besides, these results also reveal that different side chains of the small molecules can distinctly influence the crystallinity characteristics and aggregation features, and TA treatment can effectively fine&#8208;tune the phase separation to form suitable donor&#8211;acceptor interpenetrating networks, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transportation, leading to highly efficient photovoltaic performance.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Superstructures of Silica Cages</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D mesoporous superstructures of silica cages are assembled at a liquid&#8722;liquid interface. Fine tuning of the synthesis conditions enables thickness and structure control, revealing emergence of structural order from single layer to multilayer superstructures. Heterostacks of 2D superstructures with varying orientation, composition, and morphology open numerous opportunities for the design of innovative mesoporous materials with hitherto unachievable properties.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on mesoporous silica since the early 1990s, the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) silica nanostructures remains challenging. Here, mesoporous silica is synthesized at an interface between two immiscible solvents under conditions leading to the formation of 2D superstructures of silica cages, the thinnest mesoporous silica films synthesized to date. Orientational correlations between cage units increase with increasing layer number controlled via pH, while swelling with oil and mixed surfactants increase micelle size dispersity, leading to complex clathrate type structures in multilayer superstructures. The results suggest that a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystallographic registry within cage&#8208;like superstructures emerges as a result of the concerted 3D co&#8208;assembly of the organic and inorganic components. Mesoporous 2D superstructures can be fabricated over macroscopic film dimensions and stacked on top of each other. The realization of previously inaccessible mesoporous silica heterostructures with separation or catalytic properties unachievable via conventional bulk syntheses is envisioned.

Abstract
Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for the realization of integrated quantum photonic systems. However, their spectral inhomogeneity currently limits their potential applications. Here, tensile strain is applied to quantum emitters embedded in few&#8208;layer hBN films and both red and blue spectral shifts are realized with tuning magnitudes up to 65 meV, a record for any 2D quantum source. Reversible tuning of the emission and related photophysical properties is demonstrated. Rotation of the optical dipole in response to strain is also observed, suggesting the presence of a second excited state. A theoretical model is derived to describe strain&#8208;based tuning in hBN, and the rotation of the optical dipole. The study demonstrates the immense potential for strain tuning of quantum emitters in layered materials to enable their employment in scalable quantum photonic networks.

      <title>A Novel Multinary Intermetallic as an Active Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel multinary high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEIs) with an unusual periodically ordered structure and multiple non&#8208;noble elements are prepared by low&#8208;cost and scalable metallurgical technique. The HEIs present superior water splitting performance in both efficiency and stability when compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The excellent performance on water splitting is mainly owing to their chemical complexity, unique site&#8208;isolation effect, and dendrite&#8208;like porous morphology.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting offers an attractive approach for hydrogen production. However, the lack of high&#8208;performance cost&#8208;effective electrocatalyst severely hinders its applications. Here, a multinary high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) that possesses an unusual periodically ordered structure containing multiple non&#8208;noble elements is reported, which can serve as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. This HEI exhibits excellent activities in alkalinity with an overpotential of 88.2 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 40.1 mV dec&#8722;1, which are comparable to those of noble catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the chemical complexity and surprising atomic configurations provide a strong synergistic function to alter the electronic structure. Furthermore, the unique L12&#8208;type ordered structure enables a specific site&#8208;isolation effect to further stabilize the H2O/H* adsorption/desorption, which dramatically optimizes the energy barrier of hydrogen evolution. Such an HEI strategy uncovers a new paradigm to develop novel electrocatalyst with superior reaction activities.

      <title>Emergence of Nontrivial Low&#8208;Energy Dirac Fermions in Antiferromagnetic EuCd2As2</title>
      <dc:description>
When magnetism meets topology, colorful novel states can be created in materials. The realization of magnetic topological Dirac materials remains a major issue in topological physics studies. In this work, it is ascertained that the topologically nontrivial ground state of EuCd2As2 is a good candidate for different types of magnetic topological state: magnetic topological Dirac semimetal, axion insulator, antiferromagnetic TCI, and higher order topological insulator.








Abstract
Parity&#8208;time symmetry plays an essential role for the formation of Dirac states in Dirac semimetals. So far, all of the experimentally identified topologically nontrivial Dirac semimetals (DSMs) possess both parity and time reversal symmetry. The realization of magnetic topological DSMs remains a major issue in topological material research. Here, combining angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, it is ascertained that band inversion induces a topologically nontrivial ground state in EuCd2As2. As a result, ideal magnetic Dirac fermions with simplest double cone structure near the Fermi level emerge in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves inversion symmetry. The double degeneracy of the Dirac bands is protected by a combination of inversion, time&#8208;reversal, and an additional translation operation. Moreover, the calculations show that a deviation of the magnetic moments from the c&#8208;axis leads to the breaking of C3 rotation symmetry, and thus, a small bandgap opens at the Dirac point in the bulk. In this case, the system hosts a novel state containing three different types of topological insulator: axion insulator, AFM topological crystalline insulator (TCI), and higher order topological insulator. The results provide an enlarged platform for the quest of topological Dirac fermions in a magnetic system.

      <title>High&#8208;Mobility 2D Hole Gas at a SrTiO3 Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
By depositing a sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick Fe layer on STO substrates at room temperature, a 2DHG with the highest hole mobility ever reported for oxides is realized at the STO interface. The carrier type can be switched from p&#8208;type (2DHG) to n&#8208;type (2DEG) by controlling the Fe thickness.

Abstract
Strontium titanate (SrTiO3 or STO) is important for oxide&#8208;based electronics as it serves as a standard substrate for a wide range of high&#8208;temperature superconducting cuprates, colossal magnetoresistive manganites, and multiferroics. Moreover, in its heterostructures with different materials, STO exhibits a broad spectrum of important physics such as superconductivity, magnetism, the quantum Hall effect, giant thermoelectric effect, and colossal ionic conductivity, most of which emerge in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) electron gas (2DEG) formed at an STO interface. However, little is known about its counterpart system, a 2D hole gas (2DHG) at the STO interface. Here, a simple way of realizing a 2DHG with an ultrahigh mobility of 24 000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is demonstrated using an interface between STO and a thin amorphous FeOy layer, made by depositing a sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick Fe layer on an STO substrate at room temperature. This mobility is the highest among those reported for holes in oxides. The carrier type can be switched from p&#8208;type (2DHG) to n&#8208;type (2DEG) by controlling the Fe thickness. This unprecedented method of forming a 2DHG at an STO interface provides a pathway to unexplored hole&#8208;related physics in this system and enables extremely low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;speed oxide electronics.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodriven Self&#8208;Sustained Oscillation of Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Network Film with Predesignated Polydopamine Coating</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystalline network (LCN) film showing steady oscillation behavior driven by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is prepared by selectively modifying the film with polydopamine coating, which makes the NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven LCN oscillator designable and reprogrammable. It is found that the NIR light in focused sunlight is enough to actuate the oscillation, providing a new strategy to fabrication of solar power generation devices.








Abstract
Movement is one of the vital features of living systems, and remote control of bioinspired soft robotic systems in a precise, contactless and harmless way is extremely desirable but challenging. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodriven polymeric oscillator is designed and fabricated by selectively coating a mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) polymer layer on the surface of splay&#8208;aligned liquid crystalline network (LCN) film. The oscillating motions of the LCN oscillators can be facilely manipulated by tuning light intensity and film thickness. More importantly, the programmability of the PDA coating enables the oscillating behaviors of LCN film to be predesignated and finely adjusted by coating the film with PDA locally and repeatedly. The self&#8208;oscillating movement mechanism can be attributed to the temperature oscillation at the PDA&#8208;coated LCN film since it is alternatively exposed and sheltered to the NIR&#8208;light irradiations. Owing to over 50% NIR irradiation in solar spectrum, PDA&#8208;coated film is found to oscillate upon exposure of focused sunlight, presenting great potential in fabrication of solar power generation devices. This provides a versatile strategy to fabricate NIR&#8208;light&#8208;actuated polymeric oscillators, providing inspirations in the development of biological soft robots and advanced biomimetic devices.

     alt="Near&#8208;Infrared Photodriven Self&#8208;Sustained Oscillation of Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Network Film with Predesignated Polydopamine Coating"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystalline network (LCN) film showing steady oscillation behavior driven by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is prepared by selectively modifying the film with polydopamine coating, which makes the NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven LCN oscillator designable and reprogrammable. It is found that the NIR light in focused sunlight is enough to actuate the oscillation, providing a new strategy to fabrication of solar power generation devices.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movement is one of the vital features of living systems, and remote control of bioinspired soft robotic systems in a precise, contactless and harmless way is extremely desirable but challenging. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodriven polymeric oscillator is designed and fabricated by selectively coating a mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) polymer layer on the surface of splay&#8208;aligned liquid crystalline network (LCN) film. The oscillating motions of the LCN oscillators can be facilely manipulated by tuning light intensity and film thickness. More importantly, the programmability of the PDA coating enables the oscillating behaviors of LCN film to be predesignated and finely adjusted by coating the film with PDA locally and repeatedly. The self&#8208;oscillating movement mechanism can be attributed to the temperature oscillation at the PDA&#8208;coated LCN film since it is alternatively exposed and sheltered to the NIR&#8208;light irradiations. Owing to over 50% NIR irradiation in solar spectrum, PDA&#8208;coated film is found to oscillate upon exposure of focused sunlight, presenting great potential in fabrication of solar power generation devices. This provides a versatile strategy to fabricate NIR&#8208;light&#8208;actuated polymeric oscillators, providing inspirations in the development of biological soft robots and advanced biomimetic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sequential Targeting in Crosslinking Nanotheranostics for Tackling the Multibarriers of Brain Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is developed to circumvent multiple physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors, utilizing an &#8220;interlocking stratagem.&#8221; This STICK nanoplatform significantly inhibits tumor growth and prolongs the survival time with limited toxicity in mice with aggressive, intracranial brain tumors. This strategy can potentially enhance the clinical outcome of brain tumor patients.








Abstract
The efficacy of therapeutics for brain tumors is seriously hampered by multiple barriers to drug delivery, including severe destabilizing effects in the blood circulation, the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB), and limited tumor uptake. Here, a sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is presented to circumvent these important physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors. STICK nanoparticles (STICK&#8208;NPs) can sequentially target BBB/BBTB and brain tumor cells with surface maltobionic acid (MA) and 4&#8208;carboxyphenylboronic acid (CBA), respectively, and simultaneously enhance nanoparticle stability with pH&#8208;responsive crosslinkages formed by MA and CBA in situ. STICK&#8208;NPs exhibit prolonged circulation time (17&#8208;fold higher area under curve) than the free agent, allowing increased opportunities to transpass the BBB/BBTB via glucose&#8208;transporter&#8208;mediated transcytosis by MA. The tumor acidic environment then triggers the transformation of the STICK&#8208;NPs into smaller nanoparticles and reveals a secondary CBA targeting moiety for deep tumor penetration and enhanced uptake in tumor cells. STICK&#8208;NPs significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time with limited toxicity in mice with aggressive and chemoresistant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. This formulation tackles multiple physiological barriers on&#8208;demand with a simple and smart STICK design. Therefore, these features allow STICK&#8208;NPs to unleash the potential of brain tumor therapeutics to improve their treatment efficacy.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Free and Dendrite&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Zn anodes persistently suffer from deep&#8208;seated issues of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. Meanwhile, hydrogel&#8208;based Zn batteries suffer from poor mechanical properties and dehydration. An ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based Zn salt electrolyte to solve both the side&#8208;reaction of the HER and Zn&#8208;dendrite growth is developed. Furthermore, a solid polymer electrolyte is constructed to build an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion battery.








Abstract
An ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based Zn salt electrolyte is demonstrated to be an effective route to solve both the side&#8208;reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Zn&#8208;dendrite growth in Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The developed electrolyte enables hydrogen&#8208;free, dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping over 1500 h cycle (3000 cycles) at 2 mA cm&#8211;2 with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. Meanwhile, the oxygen&#8208;induced corrosion and passivation are also effectively suppressed. These features bring Zn&#8208;ion batteries an unprecedented long lifespan over 40 000 cycles at 4 A g&#8211;1 and high voltage of 2.05 V with a cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathode. Furthermore, a 28.6 &#181;m thick solid polymer electrolyte of a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) film filled with poly(ethylene oxide)/ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based Zn salt is constructed to build an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion battery. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion batteries show excellent cycling performance of 30 000 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1 at room temperature and withstand high temperature up to 70 &#176;C, low temperature to &#8211;20 &#176;C, as well as abuse test of bending deformation up to 150&#176; for 100 cycles and eight times cutting. This is the first demonstration of an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion battery based on a newly developed electrolyte, which meanwhile solves the deep&#8208;seated hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth problem in traditional Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Dendronized&#8208;Polymer Disturbing Cells' Stress Protection by Targeting Metabolism Leads to Tumor Vulnerability</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel dendronized&#8208;polymeric nanostructure is introduced, which not only delivers a therapeutic agent for photodynamic therapy, but also intervenes in the metabolic pathways of tumor cells to incapacitate the protection mechanisms for their adaptation and survival. This study represents a new potential platform based on dendronized polymers that target cancer cell metabolism for tumor suppression.








Abstract
Metabolic demand of cancer is quite unique compared to normal tissues and this is an emerging hallmark of cancer, which brings a potential opportunity to discover drugs that target cancer cell metabolism. Herein, the development of a dendronized pyropheophorbide a (Ppa)&#8208;conjugated polymer (DPP) is reported, and a linear Ppa&#8208;conjugated polymer (LPP) is reported as a control. DPP is found to disturb cellular metabolism including increased energy depletion, dysfunctional H+ regulation, and decreased antioxidation, resulting in deficiency in protecting cells from stresses. These vulnerable cells are subjected to photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment in the presence of DPP, resulting in attenuated cancer cell growth and eventually cell death. The in vivo anticancer efficacy is also ascribed to significantly prolonged blood circulation and enhanced tumor accumulation of DPP due to its unique molecular structure. This study presents a new platform using dendronized polymers for tumor suppression by targeting cancer cell metabolism.

      <title>Inhibiting Random Droplet Motion on Hot Surfaces by Engineering Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Janus&#8208;Mushroom Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
Droplets impacting on hot surfaces can randomly bounce off without becoming fully evaporated for efficient heat transfer. By surrounding a conventional surface with a unique Janus&#8208;mushroom structure endowed with favorable directionality, it is possible to concentrate small impacting droplets preferentially onto a localized hotspot to achieve enhanced cooling efficiency.








Abstract
Concentrating impacting droplets onto a localized hotspot and inducing them to remain in a preferential heat transfer mode is essential for efficient thermal management such as spray cooling. Conventionally, droplets impacting on hot surfaces can randomly bounce off without becoming fully evaporated, resulting in low heat transfer efficiency. Although the directional and guided transport of impacting droplets to a preferential location can be achieved through the introduction of a structural gradient, the manifestation of such a motion requires the meticulous control of the spatial location where the droplet is released. Here, a novel surface consisting of regularly patterned posts with Janus&#8208;mushroom structure (JMS) is designed, in which the sidewalls of the individual posts are decorated with straight and curved morphologies. It is revealed that such structural symmetry&#8208;breaking in the individual posts leads to directional liquid penetration and vapor flow toward the straight sidewall, and also reduces the work of adhesion, altogether triggering collective and preferential droplet transport at a high temperature. By surrounding a conventional surface with JMS endowed with favorable directionality, it is possible to concentrate small impacting droplets preferentially onto a localized hotspot to achieve enhanced cooling efficiency.

      <title>An Adhesive Surface Enables High&#8208;Performance Mechanical Energy Harvesting with Unique Frequency&#8208;Insensitive and Pressure&#8208;Enhanced Output Characteristics</title>
      <dc:description>
A conceptually new strategy of using contact electrification of viscoelastic polymer adhesive (VPA) surfaces is proposed and developed for green and sustainable electric energy generation by scavenging low&#8208;frequency and irregular mechanical energy with greatly improved performance. Such VPA&#8208;based generators also possess a unique frequency&#8208;insensitive output characteristic, and their electric performance is further enhanced by suitable introduction of a second adhesive layer.








Abstract
Viscoelastic polymer adhesives (VPAs) are common materials broadly used in adhesive tapes for bonding objects tightly in daily life. This work presents a conceptually new strategy of using contact electrification (rather than strong adhesion) of VPAs to directly convert mechanical energy to electric energy, generally showing 202&#8211;419% of the electric energy generated by conventional mechanical energy harvesters under the same triggering conditions. More notably, the VPA&#8208;based generators (VPAGs) possess unique frequency&#8208;insensitive and pressure&#8208;enhanced output characteristics. The output power of a VPAG not only does not show regular degradation of performance with the decrease of triggering frequency, but also can be further enhanced by simple introduction of a second VPA layer with a smaller area to increase the applied pressure without the requirement of rising applied force. The average output power density of a VPAG with a second layer of 0.5 cm &#215; 0.5 cm can reach 216.7 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, which is &#8776;150% larger than that of a VPAG without a second VPA layer. This research is of significance to harvesting the random, irregular, and low&#8208;frequency (bio&#8208;)mechanical energy that widely exists but is wasted in the environment for both stable electric energy generation and electronic device operation.

      <title>Enabling Rapid Charging Lithium Metal Batteries via Surface Acoustic Wave&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Flow</title>
      <dc:description>
Remarkably, incorporating a small, 100 MHz surface acoustic wave device (SAW) makes rechargeable lithium metal batteries practical, avoiding dendrite growth and rapid failure by encouraging electrolyte flow, which in turn, eliminates the lithium depletion layer next to the anode, leading to dense lithium plating even during very rapid charging.








Abstract
Both powerful and unstable, practical lithium metal batteries have remained a difficult challenge for over 50 years. With severe ion depletion gradients in the electrolyte during charging, they rapidly develop porosity, dendrites, and dead Li that cause poor performance and, all too often, spectacular failure. Remarkably, incorporating a small, 100 MHz surface acoustic wave device (SAW) solves this problem. Providing acoustic streaming electrolyte flow during charging, the device enables dense Li plating and avoids porosity and dendrites. SAW&#8208;integrated Li cells can operate up to 6 mA cm&#8722;2 in a commercial carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte; omitting the SAW leads to short circuiting at 2 mA cm&#8722;2. The Li deposition is morphologically dendrite&#8208;free and close to theoretical density when cycling with the SAW. With a 245 &#181;m thick Li anode in a full Li||LFP (LiFePO4) cell, introducing the SAW increases the uncycled Li from 145 to 225 &#181;m, decreasing Li consumption from 41% to only 8%. A closed&#8208;form model is provided to explain the phenomena and serve as a design tool for integrating this chemistry&#8208;agnostic approach into batteries whatever the chemistry within.

      <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Interactions from Polymeric Colloids for Strong Anisotropic Adhesion between Solid Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong and highly anisometric polymeric crystals of cellulose (cellulose nanocrystals) are explored as adhesives resulting in emergent microstructures. Their self&#8208;assembly under confinement enables alignment of the nanocrystals within macroscale lamellae. The colloidal structural adhesive, architectured from the nanometer to the centimeter&#8208;scale, presents more than 70 folds in anisotropy of adhesion, when comparing stresses applied in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane.








Abstract
Adhesion occurs by covalent bonding, as in reactive structural adhesives, or through noncovalent interactions, which are nearly ubiquitous in nature. A classic example of the latter is gecko feet, where hierarchical features enhance friction across the contact area. Biomimicry of such structured adhesion is regularly achieved by top&#8208;down lithography, which allows for direction&#8208;dependent detachment. However, bottom&#8208;up approaches remain elusive given the scarcity of building blocks that yield strong, cohesive, self&#8208;assembly across multiple length scales. Herein, an exception is introduced, namely, aqueous dispersions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) that form superstructured, adherent layers between solid surfaces upon confined evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (C&#8208;EISA). The inherently strong CNCs (EA &gt; 140 GPa) align into rigid, nematically ordered lamellae across multiple length scales as a result of the stresses associated with confined evaporation. This long&#8208;range order produces remarkable anisotropic adhesive strength when comparing in&#8208;plane (&#8776;7 MPa) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#8804;0.08 MPa) directions. These adhesive attributes, resulting from self&#8208;assembly, substantially outperform previous biomimetic adhesives obtained by top&#8208;down microfabrication (dry adhesives, friction driven), and represent a unique fluid (aqueous)&#8208;based system with significant anisotropy of adhesion. By using C&#8208;EISA, new emergent properties will be closely tied with the nature of colloids and their hierarchical assemblies.

      <title>In Situ Coating Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Stable Organic Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>
The market boom of Li&#8208;ion batteries has exacerbated the resource shortage and environmentally unfriendly technologies in traditional cathodes. The in situ growth of graphdiyne fills the blank in coating technologies for organic cathodes to solve their issues of low conductivity and molecular dissolution. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density organic batteries can become compelling alternatives for Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The preparation of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes is simple and low&#8208;cost; however, their low conductivity and molecular dissolution are two key issues that mean their energy density and power performance are far lower than those of inorganic batteries, thus hindering their practical application. To develop an effective coating technology is the key to obtain high&#8208;performance organic batteries. A general method of in situ weaving all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne nanocoatings is demonstrated. The graphdiyne can be conformally weaved on organic particles under mild conditions so that the conductivity is increased and the dissolution is suppressed. After weaving graphdiyne nanocoat, the active mass of the small&#8208;molecule organic cathodes rise to 93%, thus delivering a higher energy density of 310 W h kg&#8722;1 than previously reported, and the power performance and long&#8208;term stability are greatly improved. Additionally, this method shows great potential to become the crucial technology for fabricating organic batteries with energy density close to prevailing lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>FIB&#8208;Patterned Nano&#8208;Supercapacitors: Minimized Size with Ultrahigh Performances</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of microsized supercapacitors by preparing nano&#8208;supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes via focused ion beam (FIB) technology. The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm&#8722;3, which is far superior to other reported examples.








Abstract
Advances in microelectronic system technology have necessitated the development and miniaturization of energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are an important complement to batteries in microelectronic systems; and further reduction of the size of micro&#8208;supercapacitors is challenging. Here, a novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of micro&#8208;supercapacitors by preparing nano&#8208;supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes using focused ion beam technology. The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high areal capacitance of 9.52 mF cm&#8722;2 and a volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm&#8722;3, far superior to those of other reported works. Size reduction and the narrowing of the physical separation between nanoelectrodes are proved to be the most crucial factors in the enhancement of capacitive performances. New charge&#8208;storage mechanisms are discovered with a remarkable nonfaradaic double&#8208;layer capacitance that exists due to the considerable inner electric field force at the nanoscale. The developed strategy and the first set of data provided here shed light on the design and fabrication of flexible interdigitated NSCs that rival state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art supercapacitors in performance.

The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high areal capacitance of 9.52 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, far superior to those of other reported works. Size reduction and the narrowing of the physical separation between nanoelectrodes are proved to be the most crucial factors in the enhancement of capacitive performances. New charge&#8208;storage mechanisms are discovered with a remarkable nonfaradaic double&#8208;layer capacitance that exists due to the considerable inner electric field force at the nanoscale. The developed strategy and the first set of data provided here shed light on the design and fabrication of flexible interdigitated NSCs that rival state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art supercapacitors in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flexible All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with High&#8208;Performance Nonfullerene Active Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed and printable nonfullerene organic solar cells are fabricated. All layers from the substrate to the top electrode are solution&#8208;processed. Hydrogen molybdenum bronze is introduced to solve the charge extraction issue and the wetting issue of the top electrode (PEDOT:PSS) on a hydrophobic active layer. Efficiency over 10% (&gt;1 cm2) is obtained for the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed nonfullerene solar cells.








Abstract
All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (from the bottom substrate to the top electrode) are highly desirable for low&#8208;cost and ubiquitous applications. However, it is still challenging to fabricate efficient all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells with a high&#8208;performance nonfullerene (NF) active layer. Issues of charge extraction and wetting are persistent at the interface between the nonfullerene active layer and the printable top electrode (PEDOT:PSS). In this work, efficient all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed NF organic solar cells (from the bottom substrate to the top electrode) are reported via the adoption of a layer of hydrogen molybdenum bronze (HXMoO3) between the active layer and the PEDOT:PSS. The dual functions of HXMoO3 include: 1) its deep Fermi level of &#8722;5.44 eV can effectively extract holes from the active layer; and 2) the wetting issues of the PEDOT:PSS on the hydrophobic surface of the NF active layer can be solved. Importantly, fine control of the HXMoO3 composition during the synthesis is critical in obtaining processing orthogonality between HXMoO3 and the PEDOT:PSS. Flexible all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed NF organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 11.9% and 10.3% are obtained for solar cells with an area of 0.04 and 1 cm2, respectively.

      <title>Realizing Ultrahigh Mechanical Flexibility and &gt;15% Efficiency of Flexible Organic Solar Cells via a &#8220;Welding&#8221; Flexible Transparent Electrode</title>
      <dc:description>
A &#8220;welding&#8221; transparent flexible electrode, with respect to both the upper electrode and the underlying substrate, for fabricating high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs is proposed, resulting in a record power conversion efficiency of single&#8208;junction flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) still lag behind those of rigid devices and their mechanical stability is unable to meet the needs of flexible electronics at present due to the lack of a high&#8208;performance flexible transparent electrode (FTE). Here, a so&#8208;called &#8220;welding&#8221; concept is proposed to design an FTE with tight binding of the upper electrode and the underlying substrate. The upper electrode consisting of solution&#8208;processed Al&#8208;doped ZnO (AZO) and silver nanowire (AgNW) network is well welded by utilizing the capillary force effect and secondary growth of AZO, leading to a reduction of the AgNWs junction site resistance. Meanwhile, the poly(ethylene terephthalate) is modified by embedding the AgNWs, which are then used to link with the AgNWs in the upper hybrid electrode, thus enhancing the adhesion of the electrode to the substrate. By this welding strategy, critical bottleneck issues relating to the FTEs in terms of optoelectronic and mechanical properties are comprehensively addressed. The single&#8208;junction flexible OSCs based on this welded FTE show a high performance, achieving a record high PCE of 15.21%. In addition, the PCEs of the flexible OSCs are less influenced by the device area and display robust bending durability even under extreme test conditions.

      <title>Gate&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Enabled Robust Hysteresis for Nonvolatile Memory and Programmable Rectifier in Van der Waals Ferroelectric Heterojunctions</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric vdWHs devices are fabricated and studied systematically. With the insertion of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and a dual&#8208;gated coupling device configuration, the devices show outstanding performances when used as nonvolatile memory and programmable rectifier. This demonstrates the promising potential of ferroelectric vdWHs for new multifunctional ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) are one of the most interesting ferroelectric devices; however, they, usually suffer from low interface quality. The recently discovered 2D layered ferroelectric materials, combining with the advantages of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), may be promising to fabricate high&#8208;quality FeFETs with atomically thin thickness. Here, dual&#8208;gated 2D ferroelectric vdWHs are constructed using MoS2, hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), and CuInP2S6 (CIPS), which act as a high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory and programmable rectifier. It is first noted that the insertion of h&#8208;BN and dual&#8208;gated coupling device configuration can significantly stabilize and effectively polarize ferroelectric CIPS. Through this design, the device shows a record&#8208;high performance with a large memory window, large on/off ratio (107), ultralow programming state current (10&#8722;13 A), and long&#8208;time endurance (104 s) as nonvolatile memory. As for programmable rectifier, a wide range of gate&#8208;tunable rectification behavior is observed. Moreover, the device exhibits a large rectification ratio (3 &#215; 105) with stable retention under the programming state. This demonstrates the promising potential of ferroelectric vdWHs for new multifunctional ferroelectric devices.

      <title>Josephson Effect and Charge Distribution in Thin Bi2Te3 Topological Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
A combined gate&#8208;dependence study of the Josephson effect, carrier densities, and self&#8208;consistent band structure calculations in thin Bi2Te3 topological devices reveals that the critical current in topological Josephson devices maps the band structure properties of the films when a gate voltage is applied. A coherent picture that incorporates band bending in the discussion of proximity effects for topological devices is provided.








Abstract
Thin layers of topological insulator materials are quasi&#8208;2D systems featuring a complex interplay between quantum confinement and topological band structure. To understand the role of the spatial distribution of carriers in electrical transport, the Josephson effect, magnetotransport, and weak anti&#8208;localization are studied in bottom&#8208;gated thin Bi2Te3 topological insulator films. The experimental carrier densities are compared to a model based on the solutions of the self&#8208;consistent Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson equations and they are in excellent agreement. The modeling allows for a quantitative interpretation of the weak antilocalization correction to the conduction and of the critical current of Josephson junctions with weak links made from such films without any ad hoc assumptions.

      <title>Inverse Design Strategies for 3D Surfaces Formed by Mechanically Guided Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
An inverse design method for forming 3D surfaces through buckling&#8208;guided transformation of 2D structures is presented. Validated by numerical and experimental results in a variety of target 3D configurations (e.g., fire balloon, flower, concave lens, saddle surface, waterdrop, and rodent), this method provides a powerful tool for the design of functional devices that demand accurate 3D geometries.








Abstract
Deterministic transformations of 2D patterns of materials into well&#8208;controlled 3D mesostructures serve as the basis for manufacturing methods that can bypass limitations of conventional 3D micro/nanofabrication. Here, guided mechanical buckling processes provide access to a rich range of complex 3D mesostructures in high&#8208;performance materials, from inorganic and organic semiconductors, metals and dielectrics, to ceramics and even 2D materials (e.g., graphene, MoS2). Previous studies demonstrate that iterative computational procedures can define design parameters for certain targeted 3D configurations, but without the ability to address complex shapes. A technical need is in efficient, generalized inverse design algorithms that directly yield sets of optimized parameters.

     alt="Inverse Design Strategies for 3D Surfaces Formed by Mechanically Guided Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inverse design method for forming 3D surfaces through buckling&#8208;guided transformation of 2D structures is presented. Validated by numerical and experimental results in a variety of target 3D configurations (e.g., fire balloon, flower, concave lens, saddle surface, waterdrop, and rodent), this method provides a powerful tool for the design of functional devices that demand accurate 3D geometries.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deterministic transformations of 2D patterns of materials into well&#8208;controlled 3D mesostructures serve as the basis for manufacturing methods that can bypass limitations of conventional 3D micro/nanofabrication. Here, guided mechanical buckling processes provide access to a rich range of complex 3D mesostructures in high&#8208;performance materials, from inorganic and organic semiconductors, metals and dielectrics, to ceramics and even 2D materials (e.g., graphene, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous studies demonstrate that iterative computational procedures can define design parameters for certain targeted 3D configurations, but without the ability to address complex shapes. A technical need is in efficient, generalized inverse design algorithms that directly yield sets of optimized parameters. Here, such schemes are introduced, where the distributions of thicknesses across arrays of separated or interconnected ribbons provide scalable routes to 3D surfaces with a broad range of targeted shapes. Specifically, discretizing desired shapes into 2D ribbon components allows for analytic solutions to the inverse design of centrally symmetric and even general surfaces, in an approximate manner. Combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies of &#8776;20 different 3D structures with characteristic sizes (e.g., ribbon width) ranging from &#8776;200 &#181;m to &#8776;2 cm and with geometries that resemble hemispheres, fire balloons, flowers, concave lenses, saddle surfaces, waterdrops, and rodents, illustrate the essential ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An NIR&#8208;Responsive DNA&#8208;Mediated Nanotetrahedron Enhances the Clearance of Senescent Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;centered Au20&#8211;Au30 nanoparticles tetrahedron (UAuTe) is fabricated using DNA self&#8208;assembly. This tetrahedron selectively targets senescent cells and induces their apoptosis. The UAuTe tetrahedron rescues the loss of kidney function and the senescence phenotype in senescent mice. The developed UAuTe tetrahedron holds great promise for clinical applications in the prevention and remedy of aging.








Abstract
Senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest that can escape apoptosis and lead to aging and numerous age&#8208;related diseases. In this study, an upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle (UCNP)&#8208;centered Au20&#8211;Au30 nanoparticles tetrahedron (UAuTe) is prepared by DNA hybridization, which can selectively accelerate the clearance of senescent cells. When the beta&#8208;2&#8208;microglobulin antibody (anti&#8208;B2MG) on the Au NPs recognizes senescent cells, the application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light induces the disassembly of the UAuTe by breaking the boronic ester linkage. Subsequently, the Granzyme B exposed on the UCNPs induces apoptosis in senescent cells, which can then be tracked by changes in fluorescence. It is found that, as compared to single Granzyme B, the UAuTe can not only control the Granzyme B delivery by NIR&#8208;responsivity, but also synergistically target and activate the Granzyme B in the senescent cell without the need of perforin. Moreover, this tool is applied successfully in vivo; the results demonstrate that the NIR&#8208;responsive tetrahedron can restore renal function, tissue homeostasis, fur density, and athletic ability in a mouse model of senescence after 30 d of treatment. The NIR&#8208;induced tetrahedron provides a practical strategy for clinical diagnosis and therapy, particularly for aging and age&#8208;related diseases.

      <title>Water&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Capability Enabled by a Hydrophobic Graphene Architecture</title>
      <dc:description>
High water/air tolerance is of great importance for the application of lithium metal anodes in practical manufacture and actual use. A hydrophobic graphene architecture, consisting of aligned arrays confining lithium metal and a roof with inclined tiles, not only exerts confinement effect for lithium dendrite growth, but also impedes water/air invasion.








Abstract
Implementing the utilization of lithium metal in actual processing and application conditions is essential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries at a practical level. However, the air/water instability of the high&#8208;reactive Li metal remains unsolved. Here, a water&#8208;stable Li metal anode with ultrahigh&#8208;rate capability enabled by a rationally designed architecture is reported. A hydrophobic graphene framework, consists of an array of vertically aligned sheets and a roof of sloping&#8208;aligned sheets, is utilized to fully host lithium metal. As a result, it is first demonstrated that the composite Li metal anode can run stably even after it directly contacts with water. In addition, both the arrays and the roof in the framework are directional graphene microsheets that can provide fast charge transport kinetics in the anode without tortuosity. Therefore, the anode can operate at an extremely high current density of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term cycling stability. Importantly, the composite Li anodes in Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 cells also show much improved performances than Li metal foil under crucial conditions of lean electrolyte and low negative/positive capacity ratio. This design provides a significant stride in the safety toward the practicability of low air/water tolerance materials.

      <title>Metallopolymer Organohydrogels with Photo&#8208;Controlled Coordination Crosslinks Work Properly Below 0 &#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>
Metallopolymer organohydrogels, which function even at &#8722;20 &#176;C, are prepared using Ru&#8211;thioether coordination bonds as photoresponsive crosslinks. At &#8722;20 &#176;C, the Ru&#8211;thioether bonds are dissociated under light irradiation and re&#8208;form reversibly in the dark. This process enables reversible gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transitions, the healing of damaged gels, control over the mechanical properties of the gels, and rewriting of microstructures on the gels below 0 &#176;C to be induced.








Abstract
Controlling the structures and functions of gels is important for both fundamental research and technological applications. Introducing photoresponsive units into gels enables remote control of their properties with light. However, existing gels show photoresponsiveness only at room temperature or elevated temperatures. The development of photoresponsive gels that work below 0 &#176;C can expand their usage in cold environments. Here, photoresponsive metallopolymer organohydrogels that function even at &#8722;20 &#176;C are reported. The organohydrogels are prepared using photoresponsive Ru&#8211;thioether coordination bonds as reversible crosslinks to form polymer networks. A water/glycerol mixture is used as an anti&#8208;freezing solvent. At &#8722;20 &#176;C, the Ru&#8211;thioether coordination bonds are dissociated under light irradiation and reformed reversibly in the dark, which result in alternating crosslinking densities in the polymer networks. This process enables inducing reversible gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transitions, healing damaged gels, controlling the mechanical properties and volumes of the gels, and rewriting microstructures on the gels below 0 &#176;C.

      <title>Topological Engineering of Pt&#8208;Group&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Chiral Crystals toward High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological order and structure chirality are integrated into Pt group metals in the space group of P213 (#198). This creates a giant nontrivial topological energy window and long topological surface Fermi arcs at the crystal surfaces, leading to a fast hydrogen evolution kinetics with benchmarking turnover frequency (TOF) values, as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
It has been demonstrated that topological nontrivial surface states can favor heterogeneous catalysis processes such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but a further decrease in mass loading and an increase in activity are still highly challenging. The observation of massless chiral fermions associated with large topological charge and long Fermi arc (FA) surface states inspires the investigation of their relationship with the charge transfer and adsorption process in the HER. In this study, it is found that the HER efficiency of Pt&#8208;group metals can be boosted significantly by introducing topological order. A giant nontrivial topological energy window and a long topological surface FA are expected at the surface when forming chiral crystals in the space group of P213 (#198). This makes the nontrivial topological features resistant to a large change in the applied overpotential. As HER catalysts, PtAl and PtGa chiral crystals show turnover frequencies as high as 5.6 and 17.1 s&#8722;1 and an overpotential as low as 14 and 13.3 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. These crystals outperform those of commercial Pt and nanostructured catalysts. This work opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts with the strategy of topological engineering of excellent transitional catalytic materials.

      <title>Localized Electrons Enhanced Ion Transport for Ultrafast Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Fast ion transport inside an electrode material is crucial to efficient electrochemical energy storage. Based on the localized electrons enhanced ion&#8208;transport mechanism, Li/Na&#8208;ion diffusivity can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude after introducing abundant localized electrons. Meanwhile, the corresponding prepared ion&#8208;batteries can show ten times enhanced capacity than commercial crystals at high mass loading and high rate.








Abstract
The rate&#8208;determining process for electrochemical energy storage is largely determined by ion transport occurring in the electrode materials. Apart from decreasing the distance of ion diffusion, the enhancement of ionic mobility is crucial for ion transport. Here, a localized electron enhanced ion transport mechanism to promote ion mobility for ultrafast energy storage is proposed. Theoretical calculations and analysis reveal that highly localized electrons can be induced by intrinsic defects, and the migration barrier of ions can be obviously reduced. Consistently, experiment results reveal that this mechanism leads to an enhancement of Li/Na ion diffusivity by two orders of magnitude. At high mass loading of 10 mg cm&#8722;2 and high rate of 10C, a reversible energy storage capacity up to 190 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved, which is ten times greater than achievable by commercial crystals with comparable dimensions.

      <title>Uncovering the Potential of M1&#8208;Site&#8208;Activated NASICON Cathodes for Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The concept for a novel storage mechanism for Zn2+ in NASICON is uncovered. The dynamic Na+/Zn2+ mixed occupation at the M1 and M2 sites of ZnxNaV2(PO4)3, enabled by their concerted migration, is proposed to improve the structural stability. This work may open a new route toward designing NASICON cathodes for Zn&#8208;ion batteries for energy storage.








Abstract
There is a long&#8208;standing consciousness that the rhombohedral NASICON&#8208;type compounds as promising cathodes for Li+/Na+ batteries should have inactive M1(6b) sites with ion (de)intercalation occurring only in the M2 (18e) sites. Of particular significance is that M1 sites active for charge/discharge are commonly considered undesirable because the ion diffusion tends to be disrupted by the irregular occupation of channels, which accelerates the deterioration of battery. However, it is found that the structural stability can be substantially improved by the mixed occupation of Na+/Zn2+ at both M1 and M2 when using NaV2(PO4)3 (NVP) as a cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The results of atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy, analysis of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and an accurate bond&#8208;valence&#8208;based structural model reveal that the improvement is due to the facile migration of Zn2+ in NVP, which is enabled by a concerted Na+/Zn2+ transfer mechanism. In addition, significant improvement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical properties is achieved in Zn2+&#8208;intercalated ZnNaV2(PO4)3 in comparison with those of Na3V2(PO4)3. This work not only provides in&#8208;depth insight into Zn2+ intercalation and dynamics in NVP unlocked by activating the M1 sites, but also opens a new route toward design of improved NASICON cathodes.

      <title>Optimizing Energy Transfer in Nanostructures Enables In Vivo Cancer Lesion Tracking via Near&#8208;Infrared Excited Hypoxia Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed hypoxia nanosensor is developed, in which the donors and acceptors are precisely controlled to optimize energy transfer. This near&#8208;infrared excited core/satellite nanosensor exhibits great sensitivity, reversible response, high selectivity, and robust stability for cycling normoxia&#8211;hypoxia imaging. More importantly, combined with the reliable preclinical model, in vivo lung cancer lesion tracking is achieved.








Abstract
To explore highly sensitive and low&#8208;toxicity techniques for tracking and evaluation of non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the most mortal tumors in the world, it is utterly imperative for doctors to select the appropriate treatment strategies. Herein, developing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excited nanosensors, in which the donor and acceptor pairs within a biological metal&#8211;organic framework (bio&#8208;MOF) matrix are precisely controlled to rationalize upconversion F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), is suggested for detecting the O2 concentration inside tumors with reduced signal disturbance and health detriment. Under NIR excitation, as&#8208;fabricated core/satellite nanosensors exhibit much improved FRET efficiency and reversible hypoxic response with high sensitivity, which are effective both in vitro and in vivo (zebrafish) for cycling normoxia&#8211;hypoxia imaging. Significantly, combined with a reliable preclinical genetically engineered murine model, such nanosensors successfully realize tracking of in vivo NSCLC lesions upon clear and gradient hypoxia signals without apparent long&#8208;term biotoxicity, illustrating their exciting potential for efficient NSCLC evaluation and prognosis.

      <title>Overcoming the Limits of the Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction by Antiferromagnetic Order in Multiferroic Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions are observed in multiferroic heterostructures. Transport measurments and micromagnetic simulations verify that skyrmions at an interface can be largely extended to a thick heterostructure due to the synergistic effect of ferroelectricity and interlayer exchange coupling. This work sheds light on how multiferroic orders can overcome the limits of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Topologically protected magnetic states have a variety of potential applications in future spintronics owing to their nanoscale size (&lt;100 nm) and unique dynamics. These fascinating states, however, usually are located at the interfaces or surfaces of ultrathin systems due to the short interaction range of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, magnetic topological states in a 40&#8208;unit cells (16 nm) SrRuO3 layer are successfully created via an interlayer exchange coupling mechanism and the interfacial DMI. By controlling the thickness of an antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic layer, interfacial ionic polarization, as well as the transformation between ferromagnetic and magnetic topological states, can be modulated. Using micromagnetic simulations, the formation and stability of robust magnetic skyrmions in SrRuO3/BiFeO3 heterostructures are elucidated. Magnetic skyrmions in thick multiferroic heterostructures are promising for the development of topological electronics as well as rendering a practical approach to extend the interfacial topological phenomena to bulk via antiferromagnetic order.

      <title>Highly Efficient and Stable GABr&#8208;Modified Ideal&#8208;Bandgap (1.35 eV) Sn/Pb Perovskite Solar Cells Achieve 20.63% Efficiency with a Record Small Voc Deficit of 0.33 V</title>
      <dc:description>
GABr doping in ideal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.34 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb binary perovskite films can efficiently reduce the defect density caused by Sn2+ oxidation in the perovskite and reduce the VOC deficit. As a result, the best PCE of 20.63% with a record small VOC deficit of 0.33 V is achieved in Sn&#8211;Pb binary 1.35 eV PSCs.








Abstract
1.5&#8211;1.6 eV bandgap Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 30&#8211;31% theoretical efficiency limit by the Shockley&#8211;Queisser model achieve 21&#8211;24% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, the best PCEs of reported ideal&#8208;bandgap (1.3&#8211;1.4 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with a higher 33% theoretical efficiency limit are &lt;18%, mainly because of their large open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) deficits (&gt;0.4 V). Herein, it is found that the addition of guanidinium bromide (GABr) can significantly improve the structural and photoelectric characteristics of ideal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.34 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films. GABr introduced in the perovskite films can efficiently reduce the high defect density caused by Sn2+ oxidation in the perovskite, which is favorable for facilitating hole transport, decreasing charge&#8208;carrier recombination, and reducing the Voc deficit. Therefore, the best PCE of 20.63% with a certificated efficiency of 19.8% is achieved in 1.35 eV PSCs, along with a record small Voc deficit of 0.33 V, which is the highest PCE among all values reported to date for ideal&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Moreover, the GABr&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit significantly improved environmental and thermal stability. This work represents a noteworthy step toward the fabrication of efficient and stable ideal&#8208;bandgap PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;GABr doping in ideal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.34 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb binary perovskite films can efficiently reduce the defect density caused by Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation in the perovskite and reduce the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficit. As a result, the best PCE of 20.63% with a record small &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficit of 0.33 V is achieved in Sn&#8211;Pb binary 1.35 eV PSCs.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.5&#8211;1.6 eV bandgap Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 30&#8211;31% theoretical efficiency limit by the Shockley&#8211;Queisser model achieve 21&#8211;24% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, the best PCEs of reported ideal&#8208;bandgap (1.3&#8211;1.4 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with a higher 33% theoretical efficiency limit are &amp;lt;18%, mainly because of their large open&#8208;circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) deficits (&amp;gt;0.4 V). Herein, it is found that the addition of guanidinium bromide (GABr) can significantly improve the structural and photoelectric characteristics of ideal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.34 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films. GABr introduced in the perovskite films can efficiently reduce the high defect density caused by Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation in the perovskite, which is favorable for facilitating hole transport, decreasing charge&#8208;carrier recombination, and reducing the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; deficit. Therefore, the best PCE of 20.63% with a certificated efficiency of 19.8% is achieved in 1.35 eV PSCs, along with a record small &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; deficit of 0.33 V, which is the highest PCE among all values reported to date for ideal&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Moreover, the GABr&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit significantly improved environmental and thermal stability. This work represents a noteworthy step toward the fabrication of efficient and stable ideal&#8208;bandgap PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Situ Formed Gradient Bandgap&#8208;Tunable Perovskite for Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed Color/Spectrum&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors via Electron&#8208;Donor Control</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on an in situ formed gradient bandgap&#8208;tunable perovskite absorber, a filterless color/spectrum&#8208;sensitive photodetector with ultrahigh&#8208;speed response is achieved. The interfacial capacitance influenced by the electron donor of the absorber is identified to be the key for the response time. The EQE over 90% and the isochronous fast response demonstrate its undoubted potential in the field of spectrum analysis.








Abstract
Integration of various photodetectors with different light&#8208;sensitive materials and detection capacity is an inevitable way to achieve entire color/spectrum detection. However, the uneven capacity of each photodetector would drag the overall performance behind, especially the response speed. A response time down to nanosecond level has not previously been reported for a filter&#8208;free color/spectrum&#8208;sensitive photodetector, as far as is known. Here, a self&#8208;powered filterless color&#8208;sensitive photodetection array based on an in situ formed gradient perovskite absorber film with continuously tunable bandgap is demonstrated. Ultrahigh&#8208;speed response at nanosecond level is achieved in all the ingredient photodetectors. The junction capacitance being influenced by carrier concentration in the absorber is identified to be responsible for the detection speed. Without any optic or mechanical supporting system, the designed color detector exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 94% and a high spectral resolution of around 80 nm for the whole visible spectrum. This work offers a guidance to achieve fast response of perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors from the point of view of carrier&#8208;donor control and demonstrates a new avenue to establish color&#8208;sensitive photodetectors/spectrometers.

      <title>Superatomic Gallium Clusters in Dendrimers: Unique Rigidity and Reactivity Depending on their Atomicity</title>
      <dc:description>
Superatoms have been investigated due to their possible substitution for other elements. In this study, superatomic gallium clusters are achieved in solution phase by using a dendrimer template method. This synthesis enabled to change the number of valence electrons in these superatoms by designing the gallium clusters, resulting in unique rigidity and reactivity depending on the atomicity.








Abstract
Superatoms have been investigated due to their possible substitution for other elements. The solution&#8208;phase synthesis of superatoms has attracted attention to realize the availability of superatoms. However, the previous approach is basically limited to the formation of a single cluster. Here, superatoms are investigated and the number of valence electrons in these superatoms is changed by designing the number of gallium atoms present. Based on the dendrimer template method, clusters consisting of 3, 12, 13, and other numbers of atoms have been synthesized. The halogen&#8208;like superatomic nature of Ga13 is structurally and electrochemically observed as completely different to the other clusters. The gallium clusters of 13 and 3 atoms, which can fill the 2P and 1P superatomic orbitals, respectively, exhibit different reactivities. The 3&#8208;atom gallium cluster is suggested as being reduced to Ga3H2&#8722; due to the lower shift of energy levels in the unoccupied orbitals. The results for these gallium clusters provide candidates for superatoms.

      <title>A Colorimetric Artificial Olfactory System for Airborne Improvised Explosive Identification</title>
      <dc:description>
A colorimetric artificial olfactory system with excellent discrimination capabilities, rapid response time, and low detection limit is proposed for detecting airborne improvised explosive microparticulates. The proposed system integrates the merits of previous artificial olfactory systems and overcomes common drawbacks, which can not only resolve the challenges of improvised explosive detection, but also make the detection of nonvolatile target analytes possible.








Abstract
The detection of ultralow or nonvolatile target analytes remains a significant challenge for artificial olfactory systems even after decades of development, which severely limits their widespread application. To overcome this challenge, an artificial olfactory system based on a colorimetric hydrogel array is constructed for the first time as a universal representative. As an effective extension of conventional artificial olfactory systems that integrates the merits of its predecessors, the proposed system accurately mimics olfactory mucosa and specific odorant binding proteins using hydrogels endowed with specific colorimetric reagents for the detection of hypochlorite, chlorate, perchlorate, urea, and nitrate. Therefore, the proposed system is capable of detecting and discriminating between these five airborne improvised explosive microparticulates with a detection limit as low as 39.4 pg. Additionally, the system demonstrates good reusability over ten cycles, rapid response time of &#8776;0.2 s, and excellent discrimination properties, despite significant variation. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on colorimetric artificial olfactory systems yields a novel strategy for the direct and discriminative detection of nonvolatile airborne microparticulates.

      <title>Beyond Ternary OPV: High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Self&#8208;Driving Laboratories Optimize Multicomponent Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
While ternary blends for organic solar cells show significant performance improvements, quaternary mixtures typically cannot be fully optimized due to experimental constraints. A robot&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput technology is demonstrated that allows the stability of multicomponent blends to be investigated. Moreover, the use of machine learning algorithms enables an autonomous operation of the self&#8208;driving laboratory with highly efficient optimization routines.








Abstract
Fundamental advances to increase the efficiency as well as stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are achieved by designing ternary blends, which represents a clear trend toward multicomponent active layer blends. The development of high&#8208;throughput and autonomous experimentation methods is reported for the effective optimization of multicomponent polymer blends for OPVs. A method for automated film formation enabling the fabrication of up to 6048 films per day is introduced. Equipping this automated experimentation platform with a Bayesian optimization, a self&#8208;driving laboratory is constructed that autonomously evaluates measurements to design and execute the next experiments. To demonstrate the potential of these methods, a 4D parameter space of quaternary OPV blends is mapped and optimized for photostability. While with conventional approaches, roughly 100 mg of material would be necessary, the robot&#8208;based platform can screen 2000 combinations with less than 10 mg, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;enabled autonomous experimentation identifies stable compositions with less than 1 mg.

      <title>Initiating Hexagonal MoO3 for Superb&#8208;Stable and Fast NH4+ Storage Based on Hydrogen Bond Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal MoO3 is applied as a stable anode candidate for NH4+&#8208;ion storage and ultrafast rate performance can be realized due to the novel interaction mechanism of hydrogen bond chemistry, which is evidenced by experimental and theoretical results. A full flexible NH4+&#8208;ion battery at device level is realized by coupling with Prussian blue analog cathodes and hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Nonmetallic ammonium (NH4+) ions are applied as charge carriers for aqueous batteries, where hexagonal MoO3 is initially investigated as an anode candidate for NH4+ storage. From experimental and first&#8208;principle calculated results, the battery chemistry proceeds with reversible building&#8211;breaking behaviors of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and tunneled MoO3 electrode frameworks, where the ammoniation/deammoniation mechanism is dominated by nondiffusion&#8208;controlled pseudocapacitive behavior. Outstanding electrochemical performance of MoO3 for NH4+ storage is delivered with 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and can retain 32 mAh g&#8722;1 at 150 C. Furthermore, it remarkably exhibits ultralong and stable cyclic performance up to 100 000 cycle with 94% capacity retention and high power density of 4170 W kg&#8722;1 at 150 C. When coupled with CuFe prussian blue analogous (PBA) cathode, the full ammonium battery can deliver decent energy density 21.3 Wh kg&#8722;1 and the resultant flexible ammonium batteries at device level are also pioneeringly developed for potential realistic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Hexagonal MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is applied as a stable anode candidate for NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;ion storage and ultrafast rate performance can be realized due to the novel interaction mechanism of hydrogen bond chemistry, which is evidenced by experimental and theoretical results. A full flexible NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonmetallic ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage. From experimental and first&#8208;principle calculated results, the battery chemistry proceeds with reversible building&#8211;breaking behaviors of hydrogen bonds between NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

      <title>Smart Sponge for Fast Liquid Absorption and Thermal Responsive Self&#8208;Squeezing</title>
      <dc:description>
A smart porous sponge with aligned channel structure is fabricated by directional freezing. Compared to sponges with random porous structure, the as&#8208;prepared sponge has larger liquid absorption speed due to its lower tortuosity. The absorbed liquid can be remotely squeezed out due to thermally responsive shape memory effect. Such sponges have great potential in efficient liquid absorption and recycling.








Abstract
Liquid absorption and recycling play a crucial role in many industrial and environmental applications, such as oil spill cleanup and recovery, hemostasis, astronauts' urine recycling, and so on. Although many liquid absorbing materials have been developed, it still remains a grand challenge to achieve both fast absorption and efficient recycling in a cost&#8208;effective and energy&#8208;saving manner, especially for viscous liquids such as crude oil. A smart polyurethane&#8208;based porous sponge with aligned channel structure is prepared by directional freezing. Compared to common sponges with random porous structure, the as&#8208;prepared smart sponge has larger liquid absorption speed due to its lower tortuosity and stronger capillary (&#8220;tortuosity effect&#8221;). More importantly, the absorbed liquid can be remotely squeezed out due to a thermally responsive shape memory effect when the sponge is heated up. Such smart sponges with well&#8208;defined porous structure and thermal responsive self&#8208;squeezing capability have great potential in efficient liquid absorption and recycling.

      <title>Superhigh Electromagnetic Interference Shielding of Ultrathin Aligned Pristine Graphene Nanosheets Film</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly aligned freestanding laminated graphene films and nacre&#8208;like graphene/polymer composite films are synthesized by scanning centrifugal casting. Due to the graphene&#8208;alignment&#8208;induced high electrical conductivity and multiple internal reflections, the films show superhigh electromagnetic&#8208;interference&#8208;shielding performance, comparable to the reported best synthetic material, MXene films, at ultralow thickness, along with much better mechanical strength and thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Ultrathin, lightweight, high&#8208;strength, and thermally conductive electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with high shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desired for next&#8208;generation portable and wearable electronics. Pristine graphene (PG) has a great potential to meet all the above requirements, but the poor processability of PG nanosheets hinders its applications. Here, efficient synthesis of highly aligned laminated PG films and nacre&#8208;like PG/polymer composites with a superhigh PG loading up to 90 wt% by a scanning centrifugal casting method is reported. Due to the PG&#8208;nanosheets&#8208;alignment&#8208;induced high electrical conductivity and multiple internal reflections, such films show superhigh EMI SE comparable to the reported best synthetic material, MXene films, at an ultralow thickness. An EMI SE of 93 dB is obtained for the PG film at a thickness of &#8776;100 &#181;m, and 63 dB is achieved for the PG/polyimide composite film at a thickness of &#8776;60 &#181;m. Furthermore, such PG&#8208;nanosheets&#8208;based films show much higher mechanical strength (up to 145 MPa) and thermal conductivity (up to 190 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) than those of their MXene counterparts. These excellent comprehensive properties, along with ease of mass production, pave the way for practical applications of PG nanosheets in EMI shielding.

      <title>A Nontoxic Bifunctional (Anti)Solvent as Digestive&#8208;Ripening Agent for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional (anti)solvent system is developed for regulating the perovskite crystallization procedure. It can perform not only as an antisolvent at the spin&#8208;coating step to rapidly generate crystal seeds, but also as a solvent for ripening the precursors to large crystal grains during the thermal&#8208;annealing process. Therefore, it can significantly enhance the efficiency, stability, and reproducibility of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films is important for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The effective balance between solvent and antisolvent is an essential factor for regulating high&#8208;quality perovskite film during the spin&#8208;coating and thermal&#8208;annealing steps. In this work, a greener, nonhalogenated, nontoxic bifunctional (anti)solvent, methyl benzoate (MB), is developed not only as an antisolvent to rapidly generate crystal seeds at the perovskite spin&#8208;coating step, but also as a digestive&#8208;ripening solvent for the perovskite precursors, which can prevent the loss of organic components during the thermal&#8208;annealing stage and effectively suppress the formation of miscellaneous lead halide phases. As a result, this novel bifunctional (anti)solvent is employed in planar n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs for engineering high&#8208;quality perovskite layers and thus achieving a power conversion efficiency up to 22.37% with negligible hysteresis and &gt;1300 h stability. Moreover, due to the high boiling point and low&#8208;volatility characteristic of MB, high&#8208;performance PSCs are achieved reproducibly at different operating temperatures (22&#8211;34 &#176;C). Therefore, this developed bifunctional solvent system can provide a promising platform toward globally upscaling and commercializing PSCs in all seasons and regions.

      <title>Film Fabrication Techniques: Beyond Ternary OPV: High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Self&#8208;Driving Laboratories Optimize Multicomponent Systems (Adv. Mater. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel robot&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput film&#8208;fabrication technique, introduced by Lo&#239;c M. Roch, Thomas Heumueller, and co&#8208;workers in article number 1907801, enables quaternary semiconductor blends to be fully screened for organic photovoltaic applications. This is realized by drop&#8208;casting 96 individual solutions onto a pre&#8208;structured glass plate, resulting in smooth and homogeneous layers. Moreover, the use of machine&#8208;learning algorithms enables an autonomous operation toward highly efficient optimization routines, leading to a 30&#8208;fold faster rate than conventional high&#8208;throughput approaches.

      <title>Inverse Design Methods: Inverse Design Strategies for 3D Surfaces Formed by Mechanically Guided Assembly (Adv. Mater. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1908424, Yonggang Huang, John A. Rogers, Yihui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers present an inverse design method for forming 3D surfaces through buckling&#8208;guided transformation of 2D structures. Demonstrations in a variety of target 3D configurations (e.g., flower&#8208;, saddle&#8208;surface&#8208;, waterdrop&#8208;, and rodent&#8208;shapes) suggest this method as a powerful tool for creating functional devices that demand accurate 3D geometries.

      <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Enabling Rapid Charging Lithium Metal Batteries via Surface Acoustic Wave&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Flow (Adv. Mater. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1907516, James Friend and co&#8208;workers present the use of acoustic waves to produce electrolyte flow in lithium&#8208;metal batteries, enabling their rapid recharging without fear of damage. The surface acoustic wave device at the bottom produces 100 MHz waves across its surface, which leads to electrolyte transport between the anode and cathode, suppressing lithium&#8208;ion depletion during charging, as well as consequent heating and dendrite growth.

      <title>Biomolecular Piezoelectric Materials: From Amino Acids to Living Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
The piezoelectricity of the various elements constituting the human body has attracted intensive attention, due to the strong piezoelectricity, biocompatibility, low dielectric, and tissue regeneration effects. Research progress in the various biological piezoelectric materials from the basic building blocks to organized tissues are summarized. The mechanisms and origins of piezoelectricity are discussed, and challenges and perspectives for developing biological piezoelectric materials are presented.








Abstract
Biomolecular piezoelectric materials are considered a strong candidate material for biomedical applications due to their robust piezoelectricity, biocompatibility, and low dielectric property. The electric field has been found to affect tissue development and regeneration, and the piezoelectric properties of biological materials in the human body are known to provide electric fields by pressure. Therefore, great attention has been paid to the understanding of piezoelectricity in biological tissues and its building blocks. The aim herein is to describe the principle of piezoelectricity in biological materials from the very basic building blocks (i.e., amino acids, peptides, proteins, etc.) to highly organized tissues (i.e., bones, skin, etc.). Research progress on the piezoelectricity within various biological materials is summarized, including amino acids, peptides, proteins, and tissues. The mechanisms and origin of piezoelectricity within various biological materials are also covered.

      <title>Phase Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase engineering of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) is comprehensively reviewed. HEAs with rich constituent elements exhibit many remarkable properties that are greatly influenced by phase structure. For further exploring the properties of HEAs, controllable synthesis with desired phases is required. The diverse phase structures, phase&#8208;tuning strategies, and property adjusting of phase&#8208;engineered HEAs is presented and discussed in depth.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are based on five or more principal elements with equal or nearly equal molar fractions and possess many significant advantages over traditional alloys, including high strength and hardness, excellent corrosion resistance, outstanding thermal stability, and irradiation resistance. Phase structure plays a vital role in determining the property of HEAs. For further enhancing the performance of HEAs in various application fields, a controllable synthesis with desired phases is required. In this review, the diverse phase structures of HEAs and the related properties are first introduced. Then, alternative tuning strategies to promote the desired phase structure of HEAs are focused upon. Property adjusting of phase&#8208;engineered HEAs is also discussed in depth. Lastly, some insights into the challenges and future prospects in this rapidly emerging research field are provided.

      <title>Single&#8208;Cell Nanoencapsulation: From Passive to Active Shells</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent developments in single&#8208;cell nanoencapsulation suggest that the field has advanced to the formation of active shells for cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell structures. These active&#8208;shell structures are involved in the dynamic regulation of cellular processes while protecting the cells inside.








Abstract
Single&#8208;cell nanoencapsulation is an emerging field in cell&#8208;surface engineering, emphasizing the protection of living cells against external harmful stresses in vitro and in vivo. Inspired by the cryptobiotic state found in nature, cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell structures are formed, which are called artificial spores and which show suppression or retardation in cell growth and division and enhanced cell survival under harsh conditions. The property requirements of the shells suggested for realization of artificial spores, such as durability, permselectivity, degradability, and functionalizability, are demonstrated with various cytocompatible materials and processes. The first&#8208;generation shells in single&#8208;cell nanoencapsulation are passive in the operation mode, and do not biochemically regulate the cellular metabolism or activities. Recent advances indicate that the field has shifted further toward the formation of active shells. Such shells are intimately involved in the regulation and manipulation of biological processes. Not only endowing the cells with new properties that they do not possess in their native forms, active shells also regulate cellular metabolism and/or rewire biological pathways. Recent developments in shell formation for microbial and mammalian cells are discussed and an outlook on the field is given.

      <title>Highly Stretchable Polymer Composite with Strain&#8208;Enhanced Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Effectiveness</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly stretchable polymer composite with three&#8208;dimensional liquid metals exhibits strain&#8208;enhanced electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency over a wide range of frequencies. With an unprecedented combination of metal&#8208;like electromagnetic shielding capability, unusual strain&#8208;enhanced electrical conductivity, outstanding stretchability, and skin&#8208;compatible mechanical properties, this material fills an important gap with regard to stretchable materials that are indispensable to soft electronics.








Abstract
Polymer composites with electrically conductive fillers have been developed as mechanically flexible, easily processable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. Although there are a few elastomeric composites with nanostructured silvers and carbon nanotubes showing moderate stretchability, their EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) deteriorates consistently with stretching. Here, a highly stretchable polymer composite embedded with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) liquid&#8208;metal (LM) network exhibiting substantial increases of EMI SE when stretched is reported, which matches the EMI SE of metallic plates over an exceptionally broad frequency range of 2.65&#8211;40 GHz. The electrical conductivities achieved in the 3D LM composite are among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in stretchable conductors under large mechanical deformations. With skin&#8208;like elastic compliance and toughness, the material provides a route to meet the demands for emerging soft and human&#8208;friendly electronics.

      <title>Photolithographic Patterning of Organic Color&#8208;Centers</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic color&#8208;centers (OCCs) are patterned on thin films of carbon nanotubes by light. The light drives covalent attachment of substituted aryl groups on the host semiconductor, creating arrays of OCCs that fluoresce in the shortwave infrared. This light&#8208;driven technique opens a path to enable photolithographic patterning of this rich and emerging class of quantum emitters.








Abstract
Organic color&#8208;centers (OCCs) have emerged as promising single&#8208;photon emitters for solid&#8208;state quantum technologies, chemically specific sensing, and near&#8208;infrared bioimaging. However, these quantum light sources are currently synthesized in bulk solution, lacking the spatial control required for on&#8208;chip integration. The ability to pattern OCCs on solid substrates with high spatial precision and molecularly defined structure is essential to interface electronics and advance their quantum applications. Herein, a lithographic generation of OCCs on solid&#8208;state semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube films at spatially defined locations is presented. By using light&#8208;driven diazoether chemistry, it is possible to directly pattern p&#8208;nitroaryl OCCs, which demonstrate chemically specific spectral signatures at programmed positions as confirmed by Raman mapping and hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging. This light&#8208;driven technique enables the fabrication of OCC arrays on solid films that fluoresce in the shortwave infrared and presents an important step toward the direct writing of quantum emitters and other functionalities at the molecular level.

      <title>Chirality&#8208;Enriched Carbon Nanotubes for Next&#8208;Generation Computing</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in computing devices based on carbon nanotubes is reviewed, with an emphasis on the relationship between chirality enrichment and electronic functionality. A range of chirality&#8208;dependent electronic applications are explored including monolithic logic&#8208;memory, optoelectronic integrated circuits, neuromorphic devices, and enantiomer&#8208;recognition sensors. By identifying remaining challenges and opportunities, a roadmap for next&#8208;generation carbon nanotube computing is provided.








Abstract
For the past half century, silicon has served as the primary material platform for integrated circuit technology. However, the recent proliferation of nontraditional electronics, such as wearables, embedded systems, and low&#8208;power portable devices, has led to increasingly complex mechanical and electrical performance requirements. Among emerging electronic materials, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation computing as a result of their superlative electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. Moreover, their chirality&#8208;dependent properties enable a wide range of emerging electronic applications including sub&#8208;10 nm complementary field&#8208;effect transistors, optoelectronic integrated circuits, and enantiomer&#8208;recognition sensors. Here, recent progress in SWCNT&#8208;based computing devices is reviewed, with an emphasis on the relationship between chirality enrichment and electronic functionality. In particular, after highlighting chirality&#8208;dependent SWCNT properties and chirality enrichment methods, the range of computing applications that have been demonstrated using chirality&#8208;enriched SWCNTs are summarized. By identifying remaining challenges and opportunities, this work provides a roadmap for next&#8208;generation SWCNT&#8208;based computing.

      <dc:description>
An overview of cation&#8211;&#960; interactions and their roles in graphene&#8208;containing is presented, with a focus on water treatment applications. Relevant theoretical modeling and calculations are summarized to offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract
Cation&#8211;&#960; interactions are common in nature, especially in organisms. Their profound influences in chemistry, physics, and biology have been continuously investigated since they were discovered in 1981. However, the importance of cation&#8211;&#960; interactions in materials science, regarding carbonaceous nanomaterials, has just been realized. The interplay between cations and delocalized polarizable &#960; electrons of graphene would bring about significant changes to the intrinsic characteristics of graphene and greatly affect the device performance based on graphene and its derivatives. Here, the cation&#8211;&#960; interactions in graphene containing systems for water treatment applications (e.g., separation membranes, adsorbents) are highlighted. The cross&#8208;linking effects caused by cation&#8211;&#960; interactions contribute to membrane stability and selectivity and enhanced adsorption. Their roles in dominating the performance of graphene&#8208;based structures for other specific applications are also discussed.

      <title>Realizing Cancer Precision Medicine by Integrating Systems Biology and Nanomaterial Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent studies show how systems biology and nanomaterial engineering can overcome the challenges of each field of study to achieve cancer precision medicine. Integration of systems biology and nanomaterial engineering can resolve the problem of drug resistance and heterogeneity in cancer patients, and realize the power of precision medicine for the treatment of cancer.








Abstract
Many clinical trials for cancer precision medicine have yielded unsatisfactory results due to challenges such as drug resistance and low efficacy. Drug resistance is often caused by the complex compensatory regulation within the biomolecular network in a cancer cell. Recently, systems biological studies have modeled and simulated such complex networks to unravel the hidden mechanisms of drug resistance and identify promising new drug targets or combinatorial or sequential treatments for overcoming resistance to anticancer drugs. However, many of the identified targets or treatments present major difficulties for drug development and clinical application. Nanocarriers represent a path forward for developing therapies with these &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets or those that require precise combinatorial or sequential application, for which conventional drug delivery mechanisms are unsuitable. Conversely, a challenge in nanomedicine has been low efficacy due to heterogeneity of cancers in patients. This problem can also be resolved through systems biological approaches by identifying personalized targets for individual patients or promoting the drug responses. Therefore, integration of systems biology and nanomaterial engineering will enable the clinical application of cancer precision medicine to overcome both drug resistance of conventional treatments and low efficacy of nanomedicine due to patient heterogeneity.

      <title>Hard Carbon Nanosheets with Uniform Ultramicropores and Accessible Functional Groups Showing High Realistic Capacity and Superior Rate Performance for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Hard carbon nanosheets with centralized ultramicropores (&#8776;0.5 nm), accessible functional C&#63742;O/O&#63743;H groups, and large graphitic layer spacings exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;storage properties. The desodiation process from graphitic layers and C&#63742;O/O&#63743;H groups results in a new sodium&#8208;storage characteristic with dual&#8208;potential plateaus during the charge process, which favors a high output of 95%, realistic capacity, and rapidly capacitive sodium storage.








Abstract
Hard carbon attracts considerable attention as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries; however, their poor rate capability and low realistic capacity have motivated intense research effort toward exploiting nanostructured carbons in order to boost their comprehensive performance. Ultramicropores are considered essential for attaining high&#8208;rate capacity as well as initial Coulombic efficiency by allowing the rapid diffusion of Na+ and inhibiting the contact of the electrolyte with the inner carbon surfaces. Herein, hard carbon nanosheets with centralized ultramicropores (&#8776;0.5 nm) and easily accessible carbonyl groups (C&#63742;O)/hydroxy groups (O&#63743;H) are synthesized via interfacial assembly and carbonization strategies, delivering a large capacity (318 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.02 A g&#8722;1), superior rate capability (145 mA h g&#8722;1 at 5.00 A g&#8722;1), and approximately 95% of reversible capacity below 1.00 V. Notably, a new charge model favoring fast capacitive sodium storage with dual potential plateaus is proposed. That is, the deintercalation of Na+ from graphitic layers is manifested as the low&#8208;potential plateau region (0.01&#8722;0.10 V), contributing to stable insertion capacity; meanwhile, the surface desodiation process of the C&#63742;O and O&#63743;H groups corresponds to the high&#8208;potential plateau region (0.40&#8722;0.70 V), contributing to a fast capacitive storage.

Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) offers a promising route to rationally tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and further enhance their performance in various applications. However, it remains a great challenge to construct well&#8208;defined crystalline@amorphous core&#8211;shell heterostructured nanomaterials with the same chemical components. Herein, the synthesis of binary (Pd&#8208;P) crystalline@amorphous heterostructured nanoplates using Cu3&#8722;&#967;P nanoplates as templates, via cation exchange, is reported. The obtained nanoplate possesses a crystalline core and an amorphous shell with the same elemental components, referred to as c&#8208;Pd&#8208;P@a&#8208;Pd&#8208;P. Moreover, the obtained c&#8208;Pd&#8208;P@a&#8208;Pd&#8208;P nanoplates can serve as templates to be further alloyed with Ni, forming ternary (Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P) crystalline@amorphous heterostructured nanoplates, referred to as c&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P@a&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P. The atomic content of Ni in the c&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P@a&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P nanoplates can be tuned in the range from 9.47 to 38.61 at%. When used as a catalyst, the c&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P@a&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ni&#8208;P nanoplates with 9.47 at% Ni exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation, showing a high mass current density up to 3.05 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 4.5 times that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (0.68 A mgPd&#8722;1).

      <title>Microbial Polyhydroxyalkanoates and Nonnatural Polyesters</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable and bio&#8208;based polymers that can substitute petroleum&#8208;based plastics currently in use. A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and metabolism of PHA biosynthesis, and strategies for strain development, fermentation, and downstream processing toward the cost&#8208;effective production of natural and nonnatural polyesters having diverse material properties is provided.

Abstract
Microorganisms produce diverse polymers for various purposes such as storing genetic information, energy, and reducing power, and serving as structural materials and scaffolds. Among these polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are microbial polyesters synthesized and accumulated intracellularly as a storage material of carbon, energy, and reducing power under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon source. PHAs have attracted considerable attention for their wide range of applications in industrial and medical fields. Since the first discovery of PHA accumulating bacteria about 100 years ago, remarkable advances have been made in the understanding of PHA biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of microorganisms toward developing efficient PHA producers. Recently, nonnatural polyesters have also been synthesized by metabolically engineered microorganisms, which opened a new avenue toward sustainable production of more diverse plastics. Herein, the current state of PHAs and nonnatural polyesters is reviewed, covering mechanisms of microbial polyester biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and enzymes involved in biosynthesis of short&#8208;chain&#8208;length PHAs, medium&#8208;chain&#8208;length PHAs, and nonnatural polyesters, especially 2&#8208;hydroxyacid&#8208;containing polyesters, metabolic engineering strategies to produce novel polymers and enhance production capabilities and fermentation, and downstream processing strategies for cost&#8208;effective production of these microbial polyesters. In addition, the applications of PHAs and prospects are discussed.

      <title>A Novel Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst Ti1/rGO for Efficient Cathodic Reduction in Hybrid Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
A titanium&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC)&#8212;isolated Ti atoms anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Ti1/rGO)&#8212;is successfully synthesized, characterized, and studied in detail. The experimental results indicate that oxygen atoms tightly anchor the isolated Ti atoms on the rGO with a five coordinated local structure TiO5. This Ti&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst is proved to be good cathode material with high electrocatalytic activity toward tri&#8208;iodide reduction reaction in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are a frontier research topic in the catalysis community. Carbon materials decorated with atomically dispersed Ti are theoretically predicted with many attractive applications. However, such material has not been achieved so far. Herein, a Ti&#8208;based SAC, consisting of isolated Ti anchored by oxygen atoms on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (termed as Ti1/rGO), is successfully synthesized. The structure of Ti1/rGO is characterized by high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, being determined to have a five coordinated local structure TiO5. When serving as non&#8208;Pt cathode material in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs), Ti1/rGO exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward the tri&#8208;iodide reduction reaction. The power conversion efficiency of DSCs based on Ti1/rGO is comparable to that using conventional Pt cathode. The unique structure of TiO5 moieties and the crucial role of atomically dispersed Ti in Ti1/rGO are well understood by experiments and density functional theory calculations. This emerging material shows potential applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

      <title>Chiral CuxOS@ZIF&#8208;8 Nanostructures for Ultrasensitive Quantification of Hydrogen Sulfide In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
A CuxOS@ZIF&#8208;8 nanoprobe is fabricated for the sensitive and selective detection of H2S in vitro and in vivo through circular dichroism and fluorescent dual signals. It is discovered that the chiral CuxOS is transformed into achiral CuxS to contribute to the ultrasensitive detection.

Abstract
In this study, a CuxOS@ZIF&#8208;8 nanostructure is fabricated to quantify the levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in living cells and in vivo. Zeolitic lmidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) is chosen as an encapsulation shell to improve the selectivity of this probe. Using this unique nanostructure, ultrasensitive quantification and bioimaging of H2S in living cells are successfully achieved. The lower limit of detection is 0.8 and 5.3 nmol per 106 cells for circular dichroism and fluorescence modes, respectively. It is found that the chiral CuxOS NPs transformed into achiral CuxS NPs contribute to the ultrasensitive detection. Notably, this probe can also be carried out to detect and track H2S levels in tumor&#8208;bearing animals. The discoveries put forward for the creation of a detection platform for quantitative tracking and analysis in clinic.

      <title>Efficient and Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing a Sensitizer with Fast Triplet Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiple donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type carbazole&#8211;benzonitrile derivatives with both linear donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor and acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor structures to promote triplet upconversion are utilized as sensitizer, realizing organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with deep&#8208;blue narrow&#8208;band emission, maximum external quantum efficiency of 32.5%, and a T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &gt;3000 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m&#8722;2 simultaneously.








Abstract
Multiple donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type carbazole&#8211;benzonitrile derivatives that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are the state of the art in efficiency and stability in sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, such a motif still suffers from low reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) with emission peaks &lt;470 nm. Here, a weak acceptor of cyanophenyl is adopted to replace the stronger cyano one to construct blue emitters with multiple donors and acceptors. Both linear donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor and acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor structures are observed to facilitate delocalized excited states for enhanced mixing between charge&#8208;transfer and locally excited states. Consequently, a high kRISC of 2.36 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 with an emission peak of 456 nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.8% is achieved. When utilizing this material to sensitize a blue multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter, the corresponding device simultaneously realizes a maximum external quantum efficiency of 32.5%, CIEy &#8776; 0.12, a full width at half maximum of 29 nm, and a T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &gt; 60 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Multiple donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type carbazole&#8211;benzonitrile derivatives with both linear donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor and acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor structures to promote triplet upconversion are utilized as sensitizer, realizing organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with deep&#8208;blue narrow&#8208;band emission, maximum external quantum efficiency of 32.5%, and a T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &amp;gt;3000 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; simultaneously.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type carbazole&#8211;benzonitrile derivatives that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are the state of the art in efficiency and stability in sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, such a motif still suffers from low reverse intersystem crossing rates (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;) with emission peaks &amp;lt;470 nm. Here, a weak acceptor of cyanophenyl is adopted to replace the stronger cyano one to construct blue emitters with multiple donors and acceptors. Both linear donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor and acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor structures are observed to facilitate delocalized excited states for enhanced mixing between charge&#8208;transfer and locally excited states. Consequently, a high &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.36 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an emission peak of 456 nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.8% is achieved. When utilizing this material to sensitize a blue multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter, the corresponding device simultaneously realizes a maximum external quantum efficiency of 32.5%, CIE&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &#8776; 0.12, a full width at half maximum of 29 nm, and a T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &amp;gt; 60 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing Energy Materials by Cryogenic Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Cryogenic electron microscopy is employed in analyzing energy materials. New insights into the relationship between the action of a battery and the electrode, electrolyte, and interface chemistries are presented. This affords new perspectives for battery studies and guides the rational design of energy materials for a sustainable society.








Abstract
Safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries are increasingly indispensable in the pursuit of a wireless and fossil&#8208;free society. Advancements in present battery technologies and the investigation of next&#8208;generation batteries highly depend on the ever&#8208;deepening fundamental understanding and the rational designs of working electrodes, electrolytes, and interfaces. However, accurately analyzing energy materials and interfaces is severely hindered by their intrinsic limitations of air and electron&#8208;beam sensitivity, which restrains the research of energy materials in a low&#8208;efficiency trial&#8208;and&#8208;error paradigm. The emergence of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) has enabled the nondestructive characterization of air&#8208; and electron&#8208;beam sensitive energy materials in the microscale and nanoscale, and even at atomic resolutions, affording closer insights into the primary chemistry and physics of working batteries. Herein, the development of cryo&#8208;EM and the applications in detecting energy materials are reviewed and analyzed from its overwhelming advantages in disclosing the underlying mystery of energy materials. Critical sample preparation methods as the precondition for cryo&#8208;EM are compared, which strongly affect the characterization accuracy. Furthermore, new developments in the analysis of energy materials, especially bulk electrodes and interfaces in lithium metal batteries, are presented according to different functions of cryo&#8208;EM.

      <title>Retrieving the Coassembly Pathway of Composite Cellulose Nanocrystal Photonic Films from their Angular Optical Response</title>
      <dc:description>
The angular responses of photonic cellulose nanocrystal&#8208;based films are investigated and related to the kinetic arrest transition occurring in the suspension upon solvent evaporation during the early stages of the film formation. How addition of sol&#8211;gel organosilica precursor to the suspension alters the resulting angular response, through a delayed kinetic arrest and a reduced vertical collapse of the structure, is elucidated.








Abstract
Aqueous suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are known to self&#8208;assemble into a chiral nematic liquid crystalline phase, leading to solid&#8208;state nanostructured colored films upon solvent evaporation, even in the presence of templating agents. The angular optical response of these structures, and therefore their visual appearance, are completely determined by the spatial arrangement of the CNCs when the drying suspension undergoes a transition from a flowing and liquid crystalline state to a kinetically arrested state. Here, it is demonstrated how the angular response of the final film allows for retrieval of key physical properties and the chemical composition of the suspension at the onset of the kinetic arrest, thus capturing a snapshot of the past. To illustrate this methodology, a dynamically evolving sol&#8211;gel coassembly process is investigated by adding various amounts of organosilica precursor, namely, 1,2&#8208;bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane. The influence of organosilica condensation on the kinetic arrest can be tracked and thus explains the angular response of the resulting films. The a posteriori and in situ approach is general; it can be applied to a variety of additives in CNC&#8208;based films and it allows access to key rheological information of the suspension without using any dedicated rheological technique.

      <title>Flexible Temperature&#8208;Invariant Polymer Dielectrics with Large Bandgap</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;organic dielectric polymer with repeat units of a fairly rigid fused bicyclic structure and alkenes separated by freely rotating single bonds is proposed for energy storage at elevated temperatures. The piston&#8208;like crankshaft structure endows it with a large bandgap of &#8776;5 eV and flexibility, while being temperature&#8208;invariantly stable over &#8722;160 to 160 &#176;C.








Abstract
Flexible dielectrics operable under simultaneous electric and thermal extremes are critical to advanced electronics for ultrahigh densities and/or harsh conditions. However, conventional high&#8208;performance polymer dielectrics generally have conjugated aromatic backbones, leading to limited bandgaps and hence high conduction loss and poor energy densities, especially at elevated temperatures. A polyoxafluoronorbornene is reported, which has a key design feature in that it is a polyolefin consisting of repeating units of fairly rigid fused bicyclic structures and alkenes separated by freely rotating single bonds, endowing it with a large bandgap of &#8776;5 eV and flexibility, while being temperature&#8208;invariantly stable over &#8722;160 to 160 &#176;C. At 150 &#176;C, the polyoxafluoronorbornene exhibits an electrical conductivity two orders of magnitude lower than the best commercial high&#8208;temperature polymers, and features an unprecedented discharged energy density of 5.7 J cm&#8722;3 far outperforming the best reported flexible dielectrics. The design strategy uncovered in this work reveals a hitherto unexplored space for the design of scalable and efficient polymer dielectrics for electrical power and electronic systems under concurrent harsh electrical and thermal conditions.

      <title>Review of Emerging Potassium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The cathode, anode, electrolyte, and holistic full&#8208;cell aspects of potassium metal batteries (KMBs) are considered. A KMB cell illustrates polysulfide crossover, which adversely affects full battery performance. Other scientific and technological impediments that need to be resolved include the severe volume change at the cathode and dendrite growth at the metal anode.








Abstract
This is the first review on potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries (KSBs), which are emerging metal battery (MB) systems. Since KSBs are quite new, there are fundamental questions regarding the electrochemistry of S&#8208;based cathode and of K metal anode, as well as the holistic aspects of full&#8208;cell performance. The manuscript begins with a critical discussion regarding the potassium&#8211;sulfur electrochemistry and on how it differs from the much better&#8208;known lithium&#8211;sulfur. Cathodes are discussed next, focusing on the role of sulfur structure, carbon host chemistry and porosity, and electrolytes in establishing the reversible potassium sulfide K2Sn phase sequence, the parasitic polysulfide shuttle, pulverization&#8208;driven capacity fade, etc. Following is a discussion of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), including of hybrid solid&#8211;liquid systems that show much promise. Potassium metal anodes are then critically reviewed, emphasizing electrolyte reactions to form stable versus unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), covering the current understanding of potassium dendrites, and highlighting the deep&#8208;eutectic K&#8211;Na alloying approaches for room temperature liquid anodes. The manuscript concludes with K&#8211;S batteries, focusing on cell architectures and providing quantitative performance comparisons as master plots. Unanswered scientific/technological questions are identified, emerging research opportunities are discussed, and potential experimental and simulation&#8208;based studies that can unravel these unknowns are proposed.

      <title>Nanoscale Assembly of 2D Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanoscale assembly&#8212;the precise control over the complex interface between layers&#8212;is essential to promote continuous progress of 2D materials, especially in energy storage and conversion and environmental remediation. Recent progress, the status, future prospects, and challenges facing the nanoscopic assembly of 2D materials, mainly for energy and environmental applications, are discussed.








Abstract
Rational design of 2D materials is crucial for the realization of their profound implications in energy and environmental fields. The past decade has witnessed significant developments in 2D material research, yet a number of critical challenges remain for real&#8208;world applications. Nanoscale assembly, precise control over the orientational and positional ordering, and complex interfaces among 2D layers are essential for the continued progress of 2D materials, especially for energy storage and conversion and environmental remediation. Herein, recent progress, the status, future prospects, and challenges associated with nanoscopic assembly of 2D materials are highlighted, specifically targeting energy and environmental applications. Geometric dimensional diversity of 2D material assembly is focused on, based on novel assembly mechanisms, including 1D fibers from the colloidal liquid crystalline phase, 2D films by interfacial tension (Marangoni effect), and 3D nanoarchitecture assembly by electrochemical processes. Relevant critical advantages of 2D material assembly are highlighted for application fields, including secondary batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts, gas sensors, desalination, and water decontamination.

&lt;p&gt;Rational design of 2D materials is crucial for the realization of their profound implications in energy and environmental fields. The past decade has witnessed significant developments in 2D material research, yet a number of critical challenges remain for real&#8208;world applications. Nanoscale assembly, precise control over the orientational and positional ordering, and complex interfaces among 2D layers are essential for the continued progress of 2D materials, especially for energy storage and conversion and environmental remediation. Herein, recent progress, the status, future prospects, and challenges associated with nanoscopic assembly of 2D materials are highlighted, specifically targeting energy and environmental applications. Geometric dimensional diversity of 2D material assembly is focused on, based on novel assembly mechanisms, including 1D fibers from the colloidal liquid crystalline phase, 2D films by interfacial tension (Marangoni effect), and 3D nanoarchitecture assembly by electrochemical processes. Relevant critical advantages of 2D material assembly are highlighted for application fields, including secondary batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts, gas sensors, desalination, and water decontamination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks have received widespread attention for their role as solid electrolytes in fuel cells. The rich structural tunability, functional pore surface, and the high surface areas of such materials offer tremendous chances to orderly accommodate a variety of proton carriers and to systemically regulate the proton concentration and mobility within the available spaces.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an intriguing type of crystalline porous materials that can be readily built from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Recently, MOF materials, featuring high surface areas, rich structural tunability, and functional pore surfaces, which can accommodate a variety of guest molecules as proton carriers and to systemically regulate the proton concentration and mobility within the available space, have attracted tremendous attention for their roles as solid electrolytes in fuel cells. Recent advances in MOFs as a versatile platform for proton conduction in the field of humidity condition proton&#8208;conduction, anhydrous atmosphere proton&#8208;conduction, single&#8208;crystal proton&#8208;conduction, and including MOF&#8208;based membranes for fuel cells, are summarized and highlighted. Furthermore, the challenges, future trends, and prospects of MOF materials for solid electrolytes are also discussed.

      <title>Chalcogenides by Design: Functionality through Metavalent Bonding and Confinement</title>
      <dc:description>
The remarkable property portfolio of a wide range of chalcogenides is attributed to their unconventional bonding, coined metavalent bonding. This mechanism explains application&#8208;relevant properties, crucial for thermoelectrics, phase change materials, topological insulators or as building blocks for active photonic components. The concept of metavalent bonding provides optimization schemes for different applications and gives rise to interesting effects in reduced dimensions.








Abstract
A unified picture of different application areas for incipient metals is presented. This unconventional material class includes several main&#8208;group chalcogenides, such as GeTe, PbTe, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3, AgSbTe2 and Ge2Sb2Te5. These compounds and related materials show a unique portfolio of physical properties. A novel map is discussed, which helps to explain these properties and separates the different fundamental bonding mechanisms (e.g., ionic, metallic, and covalent). The map also provides evidence for an unconventional, new bonding mechanism, coined metavalent bonding (MVB). Incipient metals, employing this bonding mechanism, also show a special bond breaking mechanism. MVB differs considerably from resonant bonding encountered in benzene or graphite. The concept of MVB is employed to explain the unique properties of materials utilizing it. Then, the link is made from fundamental insights to application&#8208;relevant properties, crucial for the use of these materials as thermoelectrics, phase change materials, topological insulators or as active photonic components. The close relationship of the materials' properties and their application potential provides optimization schemes for different applications. Finally, evidence will be presented that for metavalently bonded materials interesting effects arise in reduced dimensions. In particular, the consequences for the crystallization kinetics of thin films and nanoparticles will be discussed in detail.

      <title>Recent Progress in Simple and Cost&#8208;Effective Top&#8208;Down Lithography for &#8776;10 nm Scale Nanopatterns: From Edge Lithography to Secondary Sputtering Lithography</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of a method for fabricating &#8776;10 nm&#8208;scale nanopatterns over large areas is an important issue. Edge lithography allows for reduction of the size of patterns through a simple and cost&#8208;effective method. More recently, secondary sputtering lithography using an ion bombardment is reported as a new method. Research on the methodology of the processes and various applications are reviewed.








Abstract
The development of a simple and cost&#8208;effective method for fabricating &#8776;10 nm scale nanopatterns over large areas is an important issue, owing to the performance enhancement such patterning brings to various applications including sensors, semiconductors, and flexible transparent electrodes. Although nanoimprinting, extreme ultraviolet, electron beams, and scanning probe litho&#8208;graphy are candidates for developing such nanopatterns, they are limited to complicated procedures with low throughput and high startup cost, which are difficult to use in various academic and industry fields. Recently, several easy and cost&#8208;effective lithographic approaches have been reported to produce &#8776;10 nm scale patterns without defects over large areas. This includes a method of reducing the size using the narrow edge of a pattern, which has been attracting attention for the past several decades. More recently, secondary sputtering lithography using an ion&#8208;bombardment technique was reported as a new method to create high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. Recent progress in simple and cost&#8208;effective top&#8208;down lithography for &#8776;10 nm scale nanopatterns via edge and secondary sputtering techniques is reviewed. The principles, technical advances, and applications are demonstrated. Finally, the future direction of edge and secondary sputtering lithography research toward issues to be resolved to broaden applications is discussed.

      <title>Tunable Diffraction Gratings from Biosourced Lyotropic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Diffraction gratings based on lyotropic chiral nematic liquid crystals are fabricated from biosourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Periodic structures of CNCs that are unidirectionally aligned perpendicular to the surface are obtained using a magnetic field. These are further captured in polymer networks to give grating hydrogels with high diffraction order, where the periodicity of the gratings can be controlled through concentration regulation.








Abstract
Diffraction gratings are important for modern optical components, such as optical multiplexers and signal processors. Although liquid crystal (LC) gratings based on thermotropic LCs have been extensively explored, they often require expensive molecules and complicated manufacturing processes. Lyotropic LCs, which can be broadly obtained from both synthetic and natural sources, have not yet been applied in optical gratings. Herein, a facile grating fabrication method using a biosourced lyotropic LC formed by cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), a material extracted from plants, is reported. Hydrogel sheets with vertically aligned uniform periodic structures are obtained by fixing the highly oriented chiral nematic LC of CNCs in polymer networks under the cooperative effects of gravity on phase separation and a magnetic field on LC orientation. The hydrogel generates up to sixth&#8208;order diffraction spots and shows linear polarization selectivity, with tunable grating periodicity controlled through LC concentration regulation. This synthesis strategy can be broadly applied to various grating materials and opens up a new area of optical materials from lyotropic LCs.

      <title>A Transparent, Wearable Fluorescent Mouthguard for High&#8208;Sensitive Visualization and Accurate Localization of Hidden Dental Lesion Sites</title>
      <dc:description>
Preliminary yet accurate diagnosis of dental caries and periodontitis is significant for protecting oral health. A wearable mouthguard of fluorescent zinc oxide&#8211;poly(dimethylsiloxane) is developed to accurately locate both obvious and hidden dental lesion sites by detecting the local release of volatile sulfur compounds, which is promising for large&#8208;scale screening of potential dental diseases before time&#8208;consuming and expensive in&#8208;dentistry examinations.








Abstract
Accurate detection and early diagnosis of oral diseases such as dental caries and periodontitis, can be potentially achieved by detecting the secretion of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in oral cavities. Current diagnostic approaches for VSCs can detect the existence and concentrations, yet are not capable of locating the dental lesion sites. Herein, the development of a unique approach for accurately locating dental lesion sites using a fluorescent mouthguard consisting of the zinc oxide&#8211;poly(dimethylsiloxane) (ZnO&#8208;PDMS) nanocomposite to detect the local release of VSCs is reported. The ZnO&#8208;PDMS mouthguard displays a highly sensitive and selective response to VSCs, and exhibits high fluorescent stability, good biocompatibility, and low biological toxicity in normal physiological environments. Then, the wearable ZnO&#8208;PDMS mouthguard is demonstrated to be able to identify the precise locations of lesion sites in human subjects. Combined with image analysis, the mouthguards successfully uncover the precise locations of dental caries, allowing convenient screening of hidden dental lesion sites that are oftentimes omitted by dentists. Due to low cost, long&#8208;term stability, and good patient compliance, the proposed wearable mouthguard is suitable for large&#8208;scale production and enables widely applicable, preliminary yet accurate screening of dental lesions prior to dental clinics and routine physical examinations.

      <title>MXene Printing and Patterned Coating for Device Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in the deposition/patterning of MXenes through printing and coating methods is summarized, including issues that is related to the formulation of MXene inks (e.g., dispersion, stability, and tuning of physical&#8211;chemical and morphological properties), relevant printing/coating methods, and their applications in energy storage, electronics/optoelectronics, sensing, and actuation.








Abstract
As a thriving member of the 2D nanomaterials family, MXenes, i.e., transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, exhibit outstanding electrochemical, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.

&lt;p&gt;Recent progress in the deposition/patterning of MXenes through printing and coating methods is summarized, including issues that is related to the formulation of MXene inks (e.g., dispersion, stability, and tuning of physical&#8211;chemical and morphological properties), relevant printing/coating methods, and their applications in energy storage, electronics/optoelectronics, sensing, and actuation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a thriving member of the 2D nanomaterials family, MXenes, i.e., transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, exhibit outstanding electrochemical, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. They have been exploited in many applications including energy storage, electronics, optoelectronics, biomedicine, sensors, and catalysis. Compared to other 2D materials, MXenes possess a unique set of properties such as high metallic conductivity, excellent dispersion quality, negative surface charge, and hydrophilicity, making them particularly suitable as inks for printing applications. Printing and pre/post&#8208;patterned coating methods represent a whole range of simple, economically efficient, versatile, and eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing techniques for devices based on MXenes. Moreover, printing can allow for complex 3D architectures and multifunctionality that are highly required in various applications. By means of printing and patterned coating, the performance and application range of MXenes can be dramatically increased through careful patterning in three dimensions; thus, printing/coating is not only a device fabrication tool but also an enabling tool for new applications as well as for industrialization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dielectric Polarization in Inverse Spinel&#8208;Structured Mg2TiO4 Coating to Suppress Oxygen Evolution of Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Dielectric inverse spinel&#8208;structured Mg2TiO4 coating on Li&#8208;rich cathode material significantly suppresses the continuous oxygen release, endowing batteries with remarkable cyclability and well&#8208;inhibited voltage decay, e.g., showing a capacity retention of &#8776;81% and voltage degradation of only 151 mV after 700 cycles, far superior to 44% and 432 mV of the unmodified counterpart.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy Li&#8208;rich layered cathode materials (&#8776;900 Wh kg&#8722;1) suffer from severe capacity and voltage decay during cycling, which is associated with layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition and oxygen redox reaction. Current efforts mainly focus on surface modification to suppress this unwanted structural transformation. However, the true challenge probably originates from the continuous oxygen release upon charging. Here, the usage of dielectric polarization in surface coating to suppress the oxygen evolution of Li&#8208;rich material is reported, using Mg2TiO4 as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept material. The creation of a reverse electric field in surface layers effectively restrains the outward migration of bulk oxygen anions. Meanwhile, high oxygen&#8208;affinity elements of Mg and Ti well stabilize the surface oxygen of Li&#8208;rich material via enhancing the energy barrier for oxygen release reaction, verified by density functional theory simulation. Benefited from these, the modified Li&#8208;rich electrode exhibits an impressive cyclability with a high capacity retention of &#8776;81% even after 700 cycles at 2 C (&#8776;0.5 A g&#8722;1), far superior to &#8776;44% of the unmodified counterpart. In addition, Mg2TiO4 coating greatly mitigates the voltage decay of Li&#8208;rich material with the degradation rate reduced by &#8776;65%. This work proposes new insights into manipulating surface chemistry of electrode materials to control oxygen activity for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Molecular Approach to Electrochemically Switchable Monolayer MoS2 Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;gated two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor with the functionalization of ferrocene&#8208;substituted alkanethiol molecules is fabricated. It can in situ program and sense the electrochemical state of the adsorbed redox&#8208;active molecules. The electrochemical stimuli from the redox&#8208;active molecules represent a remote control to modulate the electrical transport of monolayer MoS2.








Abstract
As Moore's law is running to its physical limit, tomorrow's electronic systems can be leveraged to a higher value by integrating &#8220;More than Moore&#8221; technologies into CMOS digital circuits. The hybrid heterostructure composed of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors and molecular materials represents a powerful strategy to confer new properties to the former components, realize stimuli&#8208;responsive functional devices, and enable diversification in &#8220;More than Moore&#8221; technologies. Here, an ionic liquid (IL) gated 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with molecular functionalization is fabricated. The suitably designed ferrocene&#8208;substituted alkanethiol molecules not only improve the FET performance, but also show reversible electrochemical switching on the surface of MoS2. Field&#8208;effect mobility of monolayer MoS2 reaches values as high as &#8776;116 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 105. Molecules in their neutral or charged state impose distinct doping effect, efficiently tuning the electron density in monolayer MoS2. It is noteworthy that the joint doping effect from IL and switchable molecules results in the steep subthreshold swing of MoS2 FET in the backward sweep. These results demonstrate that the device architecture represents an unprecedented and powerful strategy to fabricate switchable 2D FET with a chemically programmed electrochemical signal as a remote control, paving the road toward novel functional devices.

      <title>Aromatic Phosphonates: A Novel Group of Emitters Showing Blue Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel group of biluminescent emitters displaying blue remarkably ultralong room temperature phosphorescence at around 480 nm is presented. They possess the ability to be included as guests in polymer hosts that are dissolved in organic as well as aqueous media. Dependent on these polymers and the number of emitting groups, the phosphorescence lifetimes reach up to 2.62 s.








Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in purely organic materials showing ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with lifetimes in the range of seconds. Still, the longest known phosphorescence lifetimes are only achieved with crystalline systems so far. Here, a rational design of a completely new family of halogen&#8208;free organic luminescent derivatives in amorphous matrices, displaying both conventional fluorescence and phosphorescence is reported. Hydrogen bonding between the newly developed emitters and an ethylene&#8208;vinyl alcohol copolymer (Exceval) matrix, which efficiently suppresses vibrational dissipation, enables bright long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes up to 2.6 s at around 480 nm. The importance of the chosen matrix is shown as well as the implementation in an organic programmable luminescent tag.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Superrepellent Bioinspired Fibrillar Adhesives</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong adhesion and extreme liquid repellency are achieved simultaneously. Conventional bioinspired fibrillar dry adhesives suffer dramatic loss of adhesion when liquids, especially of low surface tension, are present at the contact interface. Dry adhesion performance under such conditions is retained by combining the effective adhesion principle of mushroom&#8208;shaped fibrillar arrays with extreme liquid repellency based on double re&#8208;entrant tip geometry.








Abstract
Bioinspired elastomeric fibrillar surfaces have significant potential as reversible dry adhesives, but their adhesion performance is sensitive to the presence of liquids at the contact interface. Like their models in nature, many artificial mimics can effectively repel water, but fail when low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids are introduced at the contact interface. A bioinspired fibrillar adhesive surface that is liquid&#8208;superrepellent even toward ultralow&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids while retaining its adhesive properties is proposed herein. This surface combines the effective adhesion principle of mushroom&#8208;shaped fibrillar arrays with liquid repellency based on double re&#8208;entrant fibril tip geometry. The adhesion performance of the proposed microfibril structures is retained even when low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids are added to the contact interface. The extreme liquid repellency enables real&#8208;world applications of fibrillar adhesives for surfaces covered with water, oil, and other liquids. Moreover, fully elastomeric liquid&#8208;superrepellent surfaces are mechanically not brittle, highly robust against physical contact, and highly deformable and stretchable, which can increase the real&#8208;world uses of such antiwetting surfaces.

      <title>Air&#8208;Stable Monolayer Cu2Se Exhibits a Purely Thermal Structural Phase Transition</title>
      <dc:description>
Purely thermal, stoichiometry&#8208;preserving, structural phase transitions are common in bulk materials, but have not been observed in 2D materials. The fabrication of monolayer Cu2Se, a new air&#8208;stable 2D material, is reported, demonstrating the existence of purely thermal, stoichiometry&#8208;preserving, reversible phase transitions with a critical temperature of &#8776;147 K.








Abstract
Materials possessing structural phase transformations exhibit a rich set of physical and chemical properties that can be used for a variety of applications. In 2D materials, structural transformations have so far been induced by strain, lasers, electron injection, electron/ion beams, thermal loss of stoichiometry, and chemical treatments or by a combination of such approaches and annealing. However, stoichiometry&#8208;preserving, purely thermal, reversible phase transitions, which are fundamental in physics and can be easily induced, have not been observed. Here, the fabrication of monolayer Cu2Se, a new 2D material is reported, demonstrating the existence of a purely thermal structural phase transition. Scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) identify two structural phases at 78 and 300 K. DFT calculations trace the phase&#8208;transition mechanism via the existence/absence of imaginary (unstable) phonon modes at low and high temperatures. In situ, variable&#8208;temperature low&#8208;energy electron diffraction patterns demonstrate that the phase transition occurs across the whole sample at &#8776;147 K. Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectra and DFT calculations show that a degeneracy at the &#915; point of the energy bands of the high&#8208;temperature phase is lifted in the low&#8208;temperature phase.

     alt="Air&#8208;Stable Monolayer Cu2Se Exhibits a Purely Thermal Structural Phase Transition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purely thermal, stoichiometry&#8208;preserving, structural phase transitions are common in bulk materials, but have not been observed in 2D materials. The fabrication of monolayer Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, a new air&#8208;stable 2D material, is reported, demonstrating the existence of purely thermal, stoichiometry&#8208;preserving, reversible phase transitions with a critical temperature of &#8776;147 K.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials possessing structural phase transformations exhibit a rich set of physical and chemical properties that can be used for a variety of applications. In 2D materials, structural transformations have so far been induced by strain, lasers, electron injection, electron/ion beams, thermal loss of stoichiometry, and chemical treatments or by a combination of such approaches and annealing. However, stoichiometry&#8208;preserving, purely thermal, reversible phase transitions, which are fundamental in physics and can be easily induced, have not been observed. Here, the fabrication of monolayer Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, a new 2D material is reported, demonstrating the existence of a purely thermal structural phase transition. Scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) identify two structural phases at 78 and 300 K. DFT calculations trace the phase&#8208;transition mechanism via the existence/absence of imaginary (unstable) phonon modes at low and high temperatures. In situ, variable&#8208;temperature low&#8208;energy electron diffraction patterns demonstrate that the phase transition occurs across the whole sample at &#8776;147 K. Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectra and DFT calculations show that a degeneracy at the &#915; point of the energy bands of the high&#8208;temperature phase is lifted in the low&#8208;temperature phase. This work opens up possibilities for studying such phase transitions in 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;Free Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: Stability Challenges and Material Solutions</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (PGM) and PGM&#8208;free catalysts are emerging as two important technologies for developing proton exchange membrane fuel cells which, however, suffer severe degradation in real&#8208;world operation. The degradation mechanisms of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;free catalysts are reviewed and materials&#8208;based solutions are discussed in order to bridge the knowledge gap between material innovation and device integration.








Abstract
Fuel cells as an attractive clean energy technology have recently regained popularity in academia, government, and industry. In a mainstream proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (PGM)&#8208;based catalysts account for &#8776;50% of the projected total cost for large&#8208;scale production. To lower the cost, two materials&#8208;based strategies have been pursued: 1) to decrease PGM catalyst usage (so&#8208;called low&#8208;PGM catalysts), and 2) to develop alternative PGM&#8208;free catalysts. Grand stability challenges exist when PGM catalyst loading is decreased in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA)&#8212;the power generation unit of a PEM fuel cell&#8212;or when PGM&#8208;free catalysts are integrated into an MEA. More importantly, there is a significant knowledge gap between materials innovation and device integration. For example, high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts usually demonstrate undesired quick degradation in MEAs. This issue significantly limits the development of PEM fuel cells. Herein, recent progress in understanding the degradation of low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;free catalysts in fuel cell MEAs and materials&#8208;based solutions to address these issues are reviewed. The key factors that degrade the MEA performance are highlighted. Innovative, emerging material concepts and development of low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;free catalysts are discussed.

      <title>Biomaterials for Personalized Cell Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomaterials enable personalized cell therapies with applications in tissue regeneration, therapeutic protein delivery, and immunotherapy. Personalized cell therapies provide localized, dynamic treatment through their innate ability to sense and respond to their microenvironment and orchestrate complex biological processes. Biomaterials to support cell viability and functionality and to instruct cell behavior including differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells are under development.








Abstract
Cell therapy has already had an important impact on healthcare and provided new treatments for previously intractable diseases. Notable examples include mesenchymal stem cells for tissue regeneration, islet transplantation for diabetes treatment, and T cell delivery for cancer immunotherapy. Biomaterials have the potential to extend the therapeutic impact of cell therapies by serving as carriers that provide 3D organization and support cell viability and function. With the growing emphasis on personalized medicine, cell therapies hold great potential for their ability to sense and respond to the biology of an individual patient. These therapies can be further personalized through the use of patient&#8208;specific cells or with precision biomaterials to guide cellular activity in response to the needs of each patient. Here, the role of biomaterials for applications in tissue regeneration, therapeutic protein delivery, and cancer immunotherapy is reviewed, with a focus on progress in engineering material properties and functionalities for personalized cell therapies.

      <title>Immunology&#8208;Guided Biomaterial Design for Mucosal Cancer Vaccines</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer of mucosal tissues is a major cause of worldwide mortality. Engineered cancer vaccines offer a promising approach for inducing antitumor immunity. Challenges associated with vaccination through mucosal and parenteral routes are discussed. Specifically, key considerations are described in the design of biomaterial&#8208;based vaccines that will afford antitumor immune protection at mucosal surfaces.








Abstract
Cancer of mucosal tissues is a major cause of worldwide mortality for which only palliative treatments are available for patients with late&#8208;stage disease. Engineered cancer vaccines offer a promising approach for inducing antitumor immunity. The route of vaccination plays a major role in dictating the migratory pattern of lymphocytes, and thus vaccine efficacy in mucosal tissues. Parenteral immunization, specifically subcutaneous and intramuscular, is the most common vaccination route. However, this induces marginal mucosal protection in the absence of tissue&#8208;specific imprinting signals. To circumvent this, the mucosal route can be utilized, however degradative mucosal barriers must be overcome. Hence, vaccine administration route and selection of materials able to surmount transport barriers are important considerations in mucosal cancer vaccine design. Here, an overview of mucosal immunity in the context of cancer and mucosal cancer clinical trials is provided. Key considerations are described regarding the design of biomaterial&#8208;based vaccines that will afford antitumor immune protection at mucosal surfaces, despite limited knowledge surrounding mucosal vaccination, particularly aided by biomaterials and mechanistic immune&#8211;material interactions. Finally, an outlook is given of how future biomaterial&#8208;based mucosal cancer vaccines will be shaped by new discoveries in mucosal vaccinology, tumor immunology, immuno&#8208;therapeutic screens, and material&#8211;immune system interplay.

Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are two fields that are instrumental in realizing the goal of precision medicine&#8212;tailoring the best treatment for each cancer patient. Recent conversion between these two fields is enabling better patient data acquisition and improved design of nanomaterials for precision cancer medicine. Diagnostic nanomaterials are used to assemble a patient&#8208;specific disease profile, which is then leveraged, through a set of therapeutic nanotechnologies, to improve the treatment outcome. However, high intratumor and interpatient heterogeneities make the rational design of diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, and analysis of their output, extremely difficult. Integration of AI approaches can bridge this gap, using pattern analysis and classification algorithms for improved diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy. Nanomedicine design also benefits from the application of AI, by optimizing material properties according to predicted interactions with the target drug, biological fluids, immune system, vasculature, and cell membranes, all affecting therapeutic efficacy. Here, fundamental concepts in AI are described and the contributions and promise of nanotechnology coupled with AI to the future of precision cancer medicine are reviewed.

      <title>Nucleic&#8208;Acid Structures as Intracellular Probes for Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors such as hybridization&#8208;based probes, aptamers, and DNAzymes have emerged as key tools for studying analytes in live cells. The current state of intracellular nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based probes is described and common strategies for probe design, what targets can be detected, and how current limitations may be overcome in the future are discussed.








Abstract
The chemical composition of cells at the molecular level determines their growth, differentiation, structure, and function. Probing this composition is powerful because it provides invaluable insight into chemical processes inside cells and in certain cases allows disease diagnosis based on molecular profiles. However, many techniques analyze fixed cells or lysates of bulk populations, in which information about dynamics and cellular heterogeneity is lost. Recently, nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based probes have emerged as a promising platform for the detection of a wide variety of intracellular analytes in live cells with single&#8208;cell resolution. Recent advances in this field are described and common strategies for probe design, types of targets that can be identified, current limitations, and future directions are discussed.

However, many techniques analyze fixed cells or lysates of bulk populations, in which information about dynamics and cellular heterogeneity is lost. Recently, nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based probes have emerged as a promising platform for the detection of a wide variety of intracellular analytes in live cells with single&#8208;cell resolution. Recent advances in this field are described and common strategies for probe design, types of targets that can be identified, current limitations, and future directions are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biomaterials as Tools to Decode Immunity</title>
      <dc:description>
The selectivity and memory of the immune system have positioned vaccines and immunotherapies as important clinical advances. New tools to study the interactions of immune signals with immune cells and tissues will help drive the next generation of these technologies. Emerging methods in which tunable properties of biomaterials are creating new tools to decode and control immunity are highlighted.








Abstract
The immune system has remarkable capabilities to combat disease with exquisite selectivity. This feature has enabled vaccines that provide protection for decades and, more recently, advances in immunotherapies that can cure some cancers. Greater control over how immune signals are presented, delivered, and processed will help drive even more powerful options that are also safe. Such advances will be underpinned by new tools that probe how immune signals are integrated by immune cells and tissues. Biomaterials are valuable resources to support this goal, offering robust, tunable properties. The growing role of biomaterials as tools to dissect immune function in fundamental and translational contexts is highlighted. These technologies can serve as tools to understand the immune system across molecular, cellular, and tissue length scales. A common theme is exploiting biomaterial features to rationally direct how specific immune cells or organs encounter a signal. This precision strategy, enabled by distinct material properties, allows isolation of immunological parameters or processes in a way that is challenging with conventional approaches. The utility of these capabilities is demonstrated through examples in vaccines for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy, as well as settings of immune regulation that include autoimmunity and transplantation.

      <title>Recent Advances in Enabling Technologies in 3D Printing for Precision Medicine</title>
      <dc:description>
Enabling technologies are being developed to advance 3D printing in precision medicine. 3D printing is advancing as a technology in patient therapies through the fabrication of patient&#8208;specific implants or models for the screening of patient&#8208;specific therapies. Technologies are improving the available materials for printing, the speed at which printing occurs, and the resolution of printed constructs.








Abstract
Advances in areas such as data analytics, genomics, and imaging have revealed individual patient complexities and exposed the inherent limitations of generic therapies for patient treatment. These observations have also fueled the development of precision medicine approaches, where therapies are tailored for the individual rather than the broad patient population. 3D printing is a field that intersects with precision medicine through the design of precision implants with patient&#8208;directed shapes, structures, and materials or for the development of patient&#8208;specific in vitro models that can be used for screening precision therapeutics. Toward their success, advances in 3D printing and biofabrication technologies are needed with enhanced resolution, complexity, reproducibility, and speed and that encompass a broad range of cells and materials. The overall goal of this progress report is to highlight recent advances in 3D printing technologies that are helping to enable advances important in precision medicine.

      <title>Glucose&#8208;Responsive Insulin and Delivery Systems: Innovation and Translation</title>
      <dc:description>
The evolution and recent progress of the mechanism, formulation, and delivery route for glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery are summarized. The perspectives and challenges for clinical translation are also discussed. This Review aims to provide fundamentals for designing desirable and applicable glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery systems in the future.








Abstract
Type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment involves daily injections or continuous infusion of exogenous insulin aimed at regulating blood glucose levels in the normoglycemic range. However, current options for insulin therapy are limited by the risk of hypoglycemia and are associated with suboptimal glycemic control outcomes. Therefore, a range of glucose&#8208;responsive components that can undergo changes in conformation or show alterations in intermolecular binding capability in response to glucose stimulation has been studied for ultimate integration into closed&#8208;loop insulin delivery or &#8220;smart insulin&#8221; systems. Here, an overview of the evolution and recent progress in the development of molecular approaches for glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery systems, a rapidly growing subfield of precision medicine, is presented. Three central glucose&#8208;responsive moieties, including glucose oxidase, phenylboronic acid, and glucose&#8208;binding molecules are examined in detail. Future opportunities and challenges regarding translation are also discussed.

Key strategies that are reported to modulate TAM behavior in cancer using biomaterials are discussed, highlighting challenges and new opportunities. The role of macrophages in wound healing is also discussed and lessons that can be applied to cancer therapies are derived.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are a complex and heterogeneous population of cells within the tumor microenvironment. In many tumor types, TAMs contribute toward tumor malignancy and are therefore a therapeutic target of interest. Here, three major strategies for regulating TAMs are highlighted, emphasizing the role of biomaterials in these approaches. First, systemic methods for targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophage are summarized and limitations to both passive and active targeting approaches considered. Second, lessons learned from the significant literature on wound healing and macrophage response to implanted biomaterials are discussed with the vision of applying these principles to localized, biomaterial&#8208;based modulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophage. Finally, the developing field of engineered macrophages, including genetic engineering and integration with biomaterials or drug delivery systems, is examined. Analysis of major challenges in the field along with exciting opportunities for the future of macrophage&#8208;based therapies in oncology are included.

The patient&#8208;specific design of precision biomaterials enables tailored medical devices for specific needs. The integration of enabling technologies like additive manufacturing is accelerating the translation and implementation of precision biomaterials in clinical practice.

Abstract
Biomaterials play a critical role in modern medicine as surgical guides, implants for tissue repair, and as drug delivery systems. The emerging paradigm of precision medicine exploits individual patient information to tailor clinical therapy. While the main focus of precision medicine to date is the design of improved pharmaceutical treatments based on &#8220;&#8208;omics&#8221; data, the concept extends to all forms of customized medical care. This includes the design of precision biomaterials that are tailored to meet specific patient needs. Additive manufacturing (AM) enables free&#8208;form manufacturing and mass customization, and is a critical enabling technology for the clinical implementation of precision biomaterials. Materials scientists and engineers can contribute to the realization of precision biomaterials by developing new AM technologies, synthesizing advanced (bio)materials for AM, and improving medical&#8208;image&#8208;based digital design. As the field matures, AM is poised to provide patient&#8208;specific tissue and organ substitutes, reproducible microtissues for drug screening and disease modeling, personalized drug delivery systems, as well as customized medical devices.

      <title>Biomimetic Nanotechnology toward Personalized Vaccines</title>
      <dc:description>
Personalized medicine is transforming how diseases are managed in the clinic. At the same time, biomimetic nanotechnology offers many advantages that can be leveraged toward the design of more effective medical interventions. Recent developments in biomimetic nanovaccines against cancer and bacterial infections are discussed, with a specific emphasis on potential avenues for personalization.








Abstract
While traditional approaches for disease management in the era of modern medicine have saved countless lives and enhanced patient well&#8208;being, it is clear that there is significant room to improve upon the current status quo. For infectious diseases, the steady rise of antibiotic resistance has resulted in super pathogens that do not respond to most approved drugs. In the field of cancer treatment, the idea of a cure&#8208;all silver bullet has long been abandoned. As a result of the challenges facing current treatment and prevention paradigms in the clinic, there is an increasing push for personalized therapeutics, where plans for medical care are established on a patient&#8208;by&#8208;patient basis. Along these lines, vaccines, both against bacteria and tumors, are a clinical modality that could benefit significantly from personalization. Effective vaccination strategies could help to address many challenging disease conditions, but current vaccines are limited by factors such as a lack of potency and antigenic breadth. Recently, researchers have turned toward the use of biomimetic nanotechnology as a means of addressing these hurdles. Recent progress in the development of biomimetic nanovaccines for antibacterial and anticancer applications is discussed, with an emphasis on their potential for personalized medicine.

     alt="Biomimetic Nanotechnology toward Personalized Vaccines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized medicine is transforming how diseases are managed in the clinic. At the same time, biomimetic nanotechnology offers many advantages that can be leveraged toward the design of more effective medical interventions. Recent developments in biomimetic nanovaccines against cancer and bacterial infections are discussed, with a specific emphasis on potential avenues for personalization.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional approaches for disease management in the era of modern medicine have saved countless lives and enhanced patient well&#8208;being, it is clear that there is significant room to improve upon the current status quo. For infectious diseases, the steady rise of antibiotic resistance has resulted in super pathogens that do not respond to most approved drugs. In the field of cancer treatment, the idea of a cure&#8208;all silver bullet has long been abandoned. As a result of the challenges facing current treatment and prevention paradigms in the clinic, there is an increasing push for personalized therapeutics, where plans for medical care are established on a patient&#8208;by&#8208;patient basis. Along these lines, vaccines, both against bacteria and tumors, are a clinical modality that could benefit significantly from personalization. Effective vaccination strategies could help to address many challenging disease conditions, but current vaccines are limited by factors such as a lack of potency and antigenic breadth. Recently, researchers have turned toward the use of biomimetic nanotechnology as a means of addressing these hurdles. Recent progress in the development of biomimetic nanovaccines for antibacterial and anticancer applications is discussed, with an emphasis on their potential for personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Materials for Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Immunotherapy has established a new paradigm for the management and treatment of diseases, leading to numerous clinical breakthroughs. The means by which materials have helped overcome critical barriers associated with emerging immunotherapies are reviewed, and new opportunities for their continued advancement are discussed.








Abstract
Breakthroughs in materials engineering have accelerated the progress of immunotherapy in preclinical studies. The interplay of chemistry and materials has resulted in improved loading, targeting, and release of immunomodulatory agents. An overview of the materials that are used to enable or improve the success of immunotherapies in preclinical studies is presented, from immunosuppressive to proinflammatory strategies, with particular emphasis on technologies poised for clinical translation. The materials are organized based on their characteristic length scale, whereby the enabling feature of each technology is organized by the structure of that material. For example, the mechanisms by which i) nanoscale materials can improve targeting and infiltration of immunomodulatory payloads into tissues and cells, ii) microscale materials can facilitate cell&#8208;mediated transport and serve as artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells, and iii) macroscale materials can form the basis of artificial microenvironments to promote cell infiltration and reprogramming are discussed. As a step toward establishing a set of design rules for future immunotherapies, materials that intrinsically activate or suppress the immune system are reviewed. Finally, a brief outlook on the trajectory of these systems and how they may be improved to address unsolved challenges in cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmunity is presented.

      <title>2D Nanomaterials for Cancer Theranostic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials with their unique nanosheet structure, large surface area, and extraordinary physicochemical properties have attracted tremendous interest for application in many different fields including nanomedicine in recent years. The recent progress in the development of different classes of 2D nanomaterials in biomedicine, especially for cancer theranostic applications, is summarized.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials with unique nanosheet structures, large surface areas, and extraordinary physicochemical properties have attracted tremendous interest. In the area of nanomedicine, research on graphene and its derivatives for diverse biomedical applications began as early as 2008. Since then, many other types of 2D nanomaterials, including transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides, black phosphorus nanosheets, layered double hydroxides, and metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets, have been explored in the area of nanomedicine over the past decade. In particular, a large surface area makes 2D nanomaterials highly efficient drug delivery nanoplatforms. The unique optical and/or X&#8208;ray attenuation properties of 2D nanomaterials can be harnessed for phototherapy or radiotherapy of cancer. Furthermore, by integrating 2D nanomaterials with other functional nanoparticles or utilizing their inherent physical properties, 2D nanomaterials may also be engineered as nanoprobes for multimodal imaging of tumors. 2D nanomaterials have shown substantial potential for cancer theranostics. Herein, the latest progress in the development of 2D nanomaterials for cancer theranostic applications is summarized. Current challenges and future perspectives of 2D nanomaterials applied in nanomedicine are also discussed.

      <title>Cancer&#8208;Targeting Nanoparticles for Combinatorial Nucleic Acid Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic nanoparticles can be used for delivery of combinations of nucleic acid, with different materials conferring different advantages for safe and effective delivery. Targeting strategies can also be employed for cancer&#8208;specific delivery, including passive targeting based on nanoparticle physical properties; active targeting using cancer&#8208;specific ligands; transcriptional targeting using cancer&#8208;specific promoters; and targeting of cancer&#8208;specific proteins or signaling pathways.








Abstract
Nucleic acids are a promising type of therapeutic for the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including cancer, but they also pose many delivery challenges. For efficient and safe delivery to cancer cells, nucleic acids must generally be packaged into a vehicle, such as a nanoparticle, that will allow them to be taken up by the target cells and then released in the appropriate cellular compartment to function. As with other types of therapeutics, delivery vehicles for nucleic acids must also be designed to avoid unwanted side effects; thus, the ability of such carriers to target their cargo to cancer cells is crucial. Classes of nucleic acids, hurdles that must be overcome for effective intracellular delivery, types of nonviral nanomaterials used as delivery vehicles, and the different strategies that can be employed to target nucleic acid delivery specifically to tumor cells are discussed. Additonally, nanoparticle designs that facilitate multiplexed delivery of combinations of nucleic acids are reviewed.

      <title>Biohybrid Design Gets Personal: New Materials for Patient&#8208;Specific Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Implantable devices function in dynamic environments, but have largely been manufactured using only synthetic materials. Recent advances in integrating responsive biological materials and bioinspired properties into such devices promise to transfer the adaptive functional behavior of organic materials to engineered systems. Significant advances in biohybrid design are highlighted, specifically the development of new responsive materials for precision medicine.








Abstract
Precision medicine requires materials and devices that can sense and adapt to dynamic physiological and pathological conditions. This motivates the design and manufacture of biohybrid materials that mimic the responsive behaviors demonstrated by natural biological systems. Two parallel approaches to biohybrid design are presented&#8212;biomimetics and biointegration. Biohybrid hydrogels that mimic the form and function of natural materials, or that integrate living cells or bioactive moieties, can respond to a range of environmental stimuli in parallel, including heat, light, pH, hydration, enzymes, and electric, mechanical, and magnetic forces. A range of examples that illustrate the tremendous potential of this nascent discipline are presented, and ongoing technical challenges related to manufacturing, storage, transport, and external noninvasive control of these materials that will need to be overcome in the coming years are outlined. The ethical, educational, and regulatory challenges that will govern translation of biohybrid design into medical applications are also discussed. Personalized medical therapies that target the precise needs of patients are a critically needed and expanding market.

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Installed Nanocarriers toward Precision Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers toward active targeted therapy of tumors, cardiovascular disease, and brain diseases, as well as the progress in the clinical stage and future perspectives for precision therapies are summarized.








Abstract
Development of drug&#8208;delivery systems that selectively target neoplastic cells has been a major goal of nanomedicine. One major strategy for achieving this milestone is to install ligands on the surface of nanocarriers to enhance delivery to target tissues, as well as to enhance internalization of nanocarriers by target cells, which improves accuracy, efficacy, and ultimately enhances patient outcomes. Herein, recent advances regarding the development of ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers are introduced and the effect of their design on biological performance is discussed. Besides academic achievements, progress on ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers in clinical trials is presented, along with the challenges faced by these formulations. Lastly, the future perspectives of ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers are discussed, with particular emphasis on their potential for emerging precision therapies.

      <title>Heat Engine Drives Transport of an FeII4L4 Cage and Cargo</title>
      <dc:description>
A heat engine composed of a coordination cage, FeII4L4, decorated with thermoresponsive chains is constructed. Upon heating and cooling, the chains expand and contract, thereby modulating the solubility preferences of the cage. Through application of a thermal gradient, the cage reversibly transfers between water and ethyl acetate, pumping its encapsulated molecular cargo along the length of a tube and back again.








Abstract
The directed motion of species against a chemical potential gradient is a fundamental feature of living systems, underpinning processes that range from transport through cell membranes to neurotransmission. The development of artificial active cargo transport could enable new modes of chemical purification and pumping. Here, a heat engine is described that drives chemical cargo between liquid phases to generate a concentration gradient. The heat engine, composed of a functionalized FeII4L4 coordination cage, is grafted with oligoethylene glycol imidazolium chains. These chains undergo a conformational change upon heating, causing the cage and its cargo to reversibly transfer between aqueous and organic phases. Furthermore, sectional heating and cooling allow for the cage to traverse multiple phase boundaries, allowing for longer&#8208;distance transport than would be possible using a single pair of phases.

      <title>Design Principles for Aqueous Interactive Materials: Lessons from Small Molecules and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, researchers develop materials which adapt their behavior in a predictable manner. Generally, stimuli&#8208;responsive systems are described as smart; however, they often cannot act autonomously. This report outlines current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous macroscopic stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, highlights existing examples of interactive materials, and suggests design principles to realize the next generation of materials with embedded autonomous function.








Abstract
Interactive materials are at the forefront of current materials research with few examples in the literature. Researchers are inspired by nature to develop materials that can modulate and adapt their behavior in accordance with their surroundings. Stimuli&#8208;responsive systems have been developed over the past decades which, although often described as &#8220;smart,&#8221; lack the ability to act autonomously. Nevertheless, these systems attract attention on account of the resultant materials' ability to change their properties in a predicable manner. These materials find application in a plethora of areas including drug delivery, artificial muscles, etc. Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are serving as the precursors for next&#8208;generation interactive materials. Interest in these systems has resulted in a library of well&#8208;developed chemical motifs; however, there is a fundamental gap between stimuli&#8208;responsive and interactive materials. In this perspective, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are outlined with a specific emphasis on aqueous macroscopic interactive materials. Compartmentalization, critical for achieving interactivity, relies on hydrophobic, hydrophilic, supramolecular, and ionic interactions, which are commonly present in aqueous systems and enable complex self&#8208;assembly processes. Relevant examples of aqueous interactive materials that do exist are given, and design principles to realize the next generation of materials with embedded autonomous function are suggested.

      <title>YAG:Ce3+ Transparent Ceramic Phosphors Brighten the Next&#8208;Generation Laser&#8208;Driven Lighting</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlling defects by adding nano&#8208;sized MgO and SiO2 enables a high transmittance nearly 80%. After annealing in air furthermore, the luminous efficiency is enhanced greatly from 106 to 223 lm W&#8722;1.

Abstract
Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce3+) transparent ceramic phosphors (TCPs) are regarded as the most promising luminescent converter for laser&#8208;driven (LD) lighting. High&#8208;quality YAG:Ce3+ TCPs are still urgent for high efficiency LD lighting devices. YAG:Ce3+ TCPs in a vacuum ambience by using nano&#8208;sized raw materials are prepared. Controlling defects by adding nano&#8208;sized MgO and SiO2 simultaneously enables a high transmittance nearly 80%. After annealing in air furthermore, the luminous efficiency is enhanced greatly from 106 to 223 lm W&#8722;1, which is the best result reported now for LD lighting. These results demonstrate that the optimizing YAG:Ce3+ TCPs in a fitting strategy will brighten once again in the next&#8208;generation LD lighting. Based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with a cathodoluminescence system, defects and Ce3+ distributions in grains are identified directly for the first time.

Personalized design of upconversion nanoparticles and detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment will result in more effective clinical translation.








Abstract
Tailoring personalized cancer nanomedicines demands detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment. In recent years, smart upconversion nanoparticles with the ability to exploit the unique characteristics of the tumor microenvironment for precise targeting have been designed. To activate upconversion nanoparticles, various bio&#8208;physicochemical characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, namely, acidic pH, redox reactants, and hypoxia, are exploited. Stimuli&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticles also utilize the excessive presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), riboflavin, and Zn2+ in tumors. An overview of the design of stimulus&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticles that precisely target and respond to tumors via targeting the tumor microenvironment and intracellular signals is provided. Detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the personalized design of upconversion nanoparticles will result in more effective clinical translation.

      <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cells with Approaching 18% Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
By finely optimizing the alkyl chains, the nonfullerene acceptor named BTP&#8208;eC9 is synthesized and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 17.8% in organic photovoltaic cells is recorded. This work demonstrates that the optimization of alkyl chains to get suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing has a great potential in further improving its photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
Optimizing the molecular structures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials is one of the most effective methods to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). For an excellent molecular system with a certain conjugated skeleton, fine tuning the alky chains is of considerable significance to fully explore its photovoltaic potential. In this work, the optimization of alkyl chains is performed on a chlorinated nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) named BTP&#8208;4Cl&#8208;BO (a Y6 derivative) and very impressive photovoltaic parameters in OPV cells are obtained. To get more ordered intermolecular packing, the n&#8208;undecyl is shortened at the edge of BTP&#8208;eC11 to n&#8208;nonyl and n&#8208;heptyl. As a result, the NFAs of BTP&#8208;eC9 and BTP&#8208;eC7 are synthesized. The BTP&#8208;eC7 shows relatively poor solubility and thus limits its application in device fabrication. Fortunately, the BTP&#8208;eC9 possesses good solubility and, at the same time, enhanced electron transport property than BTP&#8208;eC11. Significantly, due to the simultaneously enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor, the BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based single&#8208;junction OPV cells record a maximum PCE of 17.8% and get a certified value of 17.3%. These results demonstrate that minimizing the alkyl chains to get suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing has a great potential in further improving its photovoltaic performance.

To get more ordered intermolecular packing, the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;undecyl is shortened at the edge of BTP&#8208;eC11 to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;nonyl and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heptyl. As a result, the NFAs of BTP&#8208;eC9 and BTP&#8208;eC7 are synthesized. The BTP&#8208;eC7 shows relatively poor solubility and thus limits its application in device fabrication. Fortunately, the BTP&#8208;eC9 possesses good solubility and, at the same time, enhanced electron transport property than BTP&#8208;eC11. Significantly, due to the simultaneously enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor, the BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based single&#8208;junction OPV cells record a maximum PCE of 17.8% and get a certified value of 17.3%. These results demonstrate that minimizing the alkyl chains to get suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing has a great potential in further improving its photovoltaic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flexible and Ultrathin Waterproof Cellular Membranes Based on High&#8208;Conjunction Metal&#8208;Wrapped Polymer Nanofibers for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
      <dc:description>
A designed scalable, ultrathin, and flexible cellular membrane, composed of high&#8208;conjunction metal&#8208;wrapped polymer nanofibers, exhibits excellent electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Moreover, the membranes effectively integrate multifunctionalities such as antibacterial, waterproof properties, air permeability, and low&#8208;voltage uniform heating performance, offering strong potential for applications in aerospace and portable and wearable smart electronics.








Abstract
Ultrathin, lightweight, and flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are urgently demanded to address EM radiation pollution. Efficient design to utilize the shields' microstructures is crucial yet remains highly challenging for maximum EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) while minimizing material consumption. Herein, novel cellular membranes are designed based on a facile polydopamine&#8208;assisted metal (copper or silver) deposition on electrospun polymer nanofibers. The membranes can efficiently exploit the high&#8208;conjunction cellular structures of metal and polymer nanofibers, and their interactions for excellent electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and ultrahigh EMI shielding performance. EMI SE reaches more than 53 dB in an ultra&#8208;broadband frequency range at a membrane thickness of merely 2.5 &#181;m and a density of 1.6 g cm&#8722;3, and an SE of 44.7 dB is accomplished at the lowest thickness of 1.2 &#181;m. The normalized specific SE is up to 232 860 dB cm2 g&#8722;1, significantly surpassing that of other shielding materials ever reported. More, integrated functionalities are discovered in the membrane, such as antibacterial, waterproof properties, excellent air permeability, high resistance to mechanical deformations and low&#8208;voltage uniform heating performance, offering strong potential for applications in aerospace and portable and wearable smart electronics.

      <title>Unprecedented Surface Plasmon Modes in Monoclinic MoO2 Nanostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Monoclinic MoO2 nanostructures are studied as promising substrates with a strong surface plasmon effect, along with controllable plasmonic energies through tuning nanostructures both chemically and in situ. Theoretical simulation and experimental measurements reveal that the surface plasmon is from the abundant free electrons in Mo d orbitals.








Abstract
Developing stable plasmonic materials featuring earth&#8208;abundant compositions with continuous band structures, similar to those of typical metals, has received special research interest. Owing to their metal&#8208;like behavior, monoclinic MoO2 nanostructures have been found to support stable and intense surface plasmon (SP) resonances. However, no progress has been made on their energy and spatial distributions over individual nanostructures, nor the origin of their possibly existing specific SP modes. Here, various MoO2 nanostructures are designed via polydopamine chemistry and managed to visualize multiple longitudinal and transversal SP modes supported by the monoclinic MoO2, along with intrinsic interband transitions, using scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with ultrahigh&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. The identified geometry&#8208;dependent SP energies are tuned by either controlling the shape and thickness of MoO2 nanostructures through their well&#8208;designed chemical synthesis, or by altering their length using a developed electron&#8208;beam patterning technique. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong plasmonic behavior of the monoclinic MoO2 is associated with the abundant delocalized electrons in the Mo d orbitals. This work not only provides a significant improvement in imaging and tailoring SPs of nonconventional metallic nanostructures, but also highlights the potential of MoO2 nanostructures for micro&#8211;nano optical and optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Tunable Fano&#8208;Resonant Metasurfaces on a Disposable Plastic&#8208;Template for Multimodal and Multiplex Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>
Metasurface fabrication techniques are costly and time&#8208;consuming since multiple complex deposition and patterning steps are required to build a device with a small active area. The digital versatile disk (DVD)&#8208;templated metasurface approach allows the fabrication of a cost&#8208;effective Fano resonant metasurface over a large active area that provides layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer biosensing of binding and interactions of protein, antibody, and virus particles.








Abstract
Metasurfaces are engineered nanostructured interfaces that extend the photonic behavior of natural materials, and they spur many breakthroughs in multiple fields, including quantum optics, optoelectronics, and biosensing. Recent advances in metasurface nanofabrication enable precise manipulation of light&#8211;matter interactions at subwavelength scales. However, current fabrication methods are costly and time&#8208;consuming and have a small active area with low reproducibility due to limitations in lithography, where sensing nanosized rare biotargets requires a wide active surface area for efficient binding and detection. Here, a plastic&#8208;templated tunable metasurface with a large active area and periodic metal&#8211;dielectric layers to excite plasmonic Fano resonance transitions providing multimodal and multiplex sensing of small biotargets, such as proteins and viruses, is introduced. The tunable Fano resonance feature of the metasurface is enabled via chemical etching steps to manage nanoperiodicity of the plastic template decorated with plasmonic layers and surrounding dielectric medium. This metasurface integrated with microfluidics further enhances the light&#8211;matter interactions over a wide sensing area, extending data collection from 3D to 4D by tracking real&#8208;time biomolecular binding events. Overall, this work resolves cost&#8208; and complexity&#8208;related large&#8208;scale fabrication challenges and improves multilayer sensitivity of detection in biosensing applications.

      <title>Enhancement&#8208;Mode PEDOT:PSS Organic Electrochemical Transistors Using Molecular De&#8208;Doping</title>
      <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;based molecular de&#8208;dopants enable enhancement&#8208;mode PEDOT:PSS organic electrochemical transistors while retaining high specific capacitance and electronic mobilities. These amine de&#8208;dopants react as both a Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Lowry base and an electron donor, lowering the effective doping by sulfonate groups and reducing the number of free electronic charge carriers in the pristine film, respectively.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show great promise for flexible, low&#8208;cost, and low&#8208;voltage sensors for aqueous solutions. The majority of OECT devices are made using the polymer blend poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), in which PEDOT is intrinsically doped due to inclusion of PSS. Because of this intrinsic doping, PEDOT:PSS OECTs generally operate in depletion mode, which results in a higher power consumption and limits stability. Here, a straightforward method to de&#8208;dope PEDOT:PSS using commercially available amine&#8208;based molecular de&#8208;dopants to achieve stable enhancement&#8208;mode OECTs is presented. The enhancement&#8208;mode OECTs show mobilities near that of pristine PEDOT:PSS (&#8776;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) with stable operation over 1000 on/off cycles. The electron and proton exchange among PEDOT, PSS, and the molecular de&#8208;dopants are characterized to reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of the threshold voltage shift to negative voltages. Finally, the effect of the de&#8208;doping on the microstructure of the spin&#8208;cast PEDOT:PSS films is investigated.

The enhancement&#8208;mode OECTs show mobilities near that of pristine PEDOT:PSS (&#8776;2 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with stable operation over 1000 on/off cycles. The electron and proton exchange among PEDOT, PSS, and the molecular de&#8208;dopants are characterized to reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of the threshold voltage shift to negative voltages. Finally, the effect of the de&#8208;doping on the microstructure of the spin&#8208;cast PEDOT:PSS films is investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designed Growth of Large&#8208;Size 2D Single Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
To obtain large&#8208;size 2D single crystals, systematic understanding of the designed growth of 2D materials needs to be further established. Thereby, effective controls based on interfacial engineering are summarized from four critical aspects: nucleation control, growth promotion, surface engineering, and phase control. Furthermore, prospects for the bright future of 2D single crystals are also provided.








Abstract
In the &#8220;post&#8208;Moore's Law&#8221; era, new materials are highly expected to bring next revolutionary technologies in electronics and optoelectronics, wherein 2D materials are considered as very promising candidates beyond bulk materials due to their superiorities of atomic thickness, excellent properties, full components, and the compatibility with the processing technologies of traditional complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductors, enabling great potential in fabrication of logic, storage, optoelectronic, and photonic 2D devices with better performances than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ones. Toward the massive applications of highly integrated 2D devices, large&#8208;size 2D single crystals are a prerequisite for the ultimate quality of materials and extreme uniformity of properties. However, at present, it is still very challenging to grow all 2D single crystals into the wafer scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding for controlled growth of various 2D single crystals needs to be further established. Here, four key aspects are reviewed, i.e., nucleation control, growth promotion, surface engineering, and phase control, which are expected to be controllable at different periods during the growth. In addition, the perspectives on designed growth and potential applications are discussed for showing the bright future of these advanced material systems of 2D single crystals.

      <title>Progress in Computational and Machine&#8208;Learning Methods for Heterogeneous Small&#8208;Molecule Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Computational approaches such as density functional theory, microkinetic modeling, data science, and machine learning have guided the rational design of catalysts by elucidating mechanistic insights, identifying active sites, and predicting catalytic activity. The theory and methodologies for heterogeneous catalysis and their applications for small&#8208;molecule activation are reviewed.








Abstract
The chemical conversion of small molecules such as H2, H2O, O2, N2, CO2, and CH4 to energy and chemicals is critical for a sustainable energy future. However, the high chemical stability of these molecules poses grand challenges to the practical implementation of these processes. In this regard, computational approaches such as density functional theory, microkinetic modeling, data science, and machine learning have guided the rational design of catalysts by elucidating mechanistic insights, identifying active sites, and predicting catalytic activity. Here, the theory and methodologies for heterogeneous catalysis and their applications for small&#8208;molecule activation are reviewed. An overview of fundamental theory and key computational methods for designing catalysts, including the emerging data science techniques in particular, is given. Applications of these methods for finding efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of the aforementioned small molecules are then surveyed. Finally, promising directions of the computational catalysis field for further outlooks are discussed, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for new methods.
