      <dc:description>
A volumetric 3D display system is demonstrated by harnessing photo&#8208;activated phosphorescence of two selected molecular phosphors in a photochemically deoxygenating solvent, as reported by W. Lu and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003160). The phosphorescent voxels, 3D images, and animations are well&#8208;defined by the intersections of two programmable excitation&#8208;beams, and are convenient for visualization by naked eyes with relatively high resolutions.

      <title>Vancomycin Resistance is Overcome by Conjugation of Polycationic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacterial resistance threatens to destroy the achievements of antibiotic therapy. As P. Uhl et&#8197;al. report in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002727), a 1000&#8208;fold increase in the activity of the reserve antibiotic vancomycin was achieved by using peptide conjugates. This approach reveals the potential of chemically modifying proven natural products as an alternative to the costly de&#8197;novo development of active substances.

      <title>A Case for Bond&#8208;Network Analysis in the Synthesis of Bridged Polycyclic Complex Molecules: Hetidine and Hetisine Diterpenoid Alkaloids</title>
      <dc:description>
A key challenge in the synthesis of diterpenoid alkaloids lies in identifying efficient strategies to construct their multiply bridged polycyclic skeletons. Approaches from eight recent syntheses are discussed in the context of &#8220;bond&#8208;network analyses&#8221;, highlighting the efficacy of bond&#8208;network analyses for synthesis planning, as well as where other considerations had to be incorporated.







Abstract
A key challenge in the synthesis of diterpenoid alkaloids lies in identifying strategies that rapidly construct their multiply bridged polycyclic skeletons. Existing approaches to these structurally intricate secondary metabolites are discussed in the context of a &#8220;bond&#8208;network analysis&#8221; of molecular frameworks, which was originally devised by Corey some 40 years ago. The retrosynthesis plans that emerge from a topological analysis of the highly bridged frameworks of the diterpenoid alkaloids are discussed in the context of eight recent syntheses of hetidine and hetisine natural products and their derivatives. This Minireview highlights the extent to which network analyses of the type described here sufficed for designing synthesis plans, as well as areas where they had to be amalgamated with functional group oriented synthetic planning considerations.

      <dc:description>
The entanglement of states is a fascinating results of quantum physics. In the singlet fission process, a pair of chromophores in the S1S0 state evolves into the spin&#8208;entangled T1T1 state. While most studies on singlet fission are restricted to alternated hydrocarbons, the potential of diradicaloids as singlet fission chromophores remains largely unexplored.

      <title>A Diffusion&#8208;Reaction Competition Mechanism to Tailor Lithium Deposition for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The deposition morphology of the lithium metal anode impacts the lifespan of lithium batteries. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000375), Q. Zhang and co&#8208;workers propose a diffusion&#8211;reaction competition mechanism. Depending on the rate&#8208;determining step of lithium deposition, different lithium deposition scenarios can be achieved: While the diffusion&#8208;controlled process tends to favor dendritic lithium deposition, the reaction&#8208;controlled process leads to spherical lithium deposition.

Using commercially available, classic Noyori Ru(II)&#8208;diamine&#8208;diphosphine catalysts, well&#8208;known in asymmetric hydrogenation, racemic secondary alcohols are shown to couple with primary alcohols in the presence of a base, affording new chiral alcohols with enantiomeric ratios of up to 99:1. Requiring no reducing agents, the protocol provides an easy, alternative route for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds via a Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogen&#8208;autotransfer process in concert with a base&#8208;promoted allylic alcohol isomerization.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal Nitrides as Novel Catalyst Supports for Tuning CO/H2 Syngas Production from Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) to produce synthesis gas (syngas) with tunable CO/H  2  ratios has been studied by supporting Pd catalysts on transition metal nitride (TMN) substrates. Combining experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Pd&#8208;modified niobium nitride (Pd/NbN) is found to generate much higher CO and H  2  partial current densities and greater CO Faradaic efficiency than Pd&#8208;modified vanadium nitride (Pd/VN) and commercial Pd/C catalysts. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction identifies the formation of PdH in Pd/NbN and Pd/C under CO  2  RR conditions, whereas the Pd in Pd/VN is not fully transformed into the active PdH phase. DFT calculations show that the stabilized *HOCO and weakened *CO intermediates on PdH/NbN are critical to achieving higher CO  2  RR activity. This work suggests that NbN is a promising substrate to modify Pd, resulting in an enhanced electrochemical conversion of CO  2  to syngas with a potential reduction in precious metal loading.</dc:description>

      <title>Coercive Fields Above 6 T in Two Cobalt(II)&#8208;Radical Chain Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanide permanent magnets are widely used in applications ranging from nanotechnology to industrial engineering. However, limited access to the rare earths and rising costs associated with their extraction are spurring interest in the development of lanthanide&#8208;free hard magnets. Zero&#8208; and one&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials are intriguing alternatives due to their low densities, structural and chemical versatility, and the typically mild, bottom&#8208;up nature of their synthesis. Here, we present two one&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) systems Co(hfac)  2  (R&#8208;NapNIT) (R&#8208;NapNIT = 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;(R&#8208;)naphthyl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxide, R = MeO or EtO) supported by air&#8208;stable nitronyl nitroxide radicals. These compounds are single&#8208;chain magnets and exhibit wide, square magnetic hysteresis below 14 K, with giant coercive fields up to 65 or 102 kOe measured using static or pulsed high magnetic fields, respectively. Magnetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies suggest that the record coercivities derive not from three&#8208;dimensional ordering but from the interaction of adjacent chains that compose alternating magnetic sublattices generated by crystallographic symmetry.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lanthanide permanent magnets are widely used in applications ranging from nanotechnology to industrial engineering. However, limited access to the rare earths and rising costs associated with their extraction are spurring interest in the development of lanthanide&#8208;free hard magnets. Zero&#8208; and one&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials are intriguing alternatives due to their low densities, structural and chemical versatility, and the typically mild, bottom&#8208;up nature of their synthesis. Here, we present two one&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) systems Co(hfac)  2  (R&#8208;NapNIT) (R&#8208;NapNIT = 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;(R&#8208;)naphthyl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxide, R = MeO or EtO) supported by air&#8208;stable nitronyl nitroxide radicals. These compounds are single&#8208;chain magnets and exhibit wide, square magnetic hysteresis below 14 K, with giant coercive fields up to 65 or 102 kOe measured using static or pulsed high magnetic fields, respectively. Magnetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies suggest that the record coercivities derive not from three&#8208;dimensional ordering but from the interaction of adjacent chains that compose alternating magnetic sublattices generated by crystallographic symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hydrogenolysis of Polysilanes Catalyzed by Low&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Si&#8722;Si bonds in polysilanes can be converted to Si&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions by using low&#8208;valent anionic Ni0 hydride catalysts. The reaction is reversible and dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes is also possible. Experiments and DFT calculations indicate that low&#8208;coordinated 14&#8208; and 16&#8208;electron d10&#8208;Ni hydrides, silyl, and silane intermediates are involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The dehydrogenation of organosilanes (RxSiH4&#8722;x) under the formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an intensively investigated process leading to oligo&#8208; or polysilanes. The reverse reaction is little studied. To date, the hydrogenolysis of Si&#8722;Si bonds requires very harsh conditions and is very unselective, leading to multiple side products. Herein, we describe a new catalytic hydrogenation of oligo&#8208; and polysilanes that is highly selective and proceeds under mild conditions. New low&#8208;valent nickel hydride complexes are used as catalysts and secondary silanes, RR&#8242;SiH2, are obtained as products in high purity.

      <title>Photoinduced Nonadiabatic Decay&#8208;guided Molecular Motor Triggers Effective Photothermal Conversion for Hyperthermia Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Photothermal agents, which can release nonradiative heat by strongly twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state and/or molecular motions in aggregates, have been implemented in photothermal therapy for treating diseases. To achieve enhanced nonradiative decay, long alkyl&#8208;chains and bulky substituents have been proposed to be introduced into the large conjugation structure, which always require complicated synthetic procedures. Thus, it remains highly challenging to strategically explore small molecule&#8208;based photothermal agents with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE). Herein, we adopt a double bond&#8208;based molecular motor  concept to develop a new class of small photothermal agents to break the current design bottleneck. As the double&#8208;bond is twisted by strong TICT upon irradiation, the excited agents can deactivate nonradiatively through the conical intersection (CI) of internal conversion, which is called as photoinduced nonadiabatic decay. Such agents thus possess a high PTCE of ~90.0%, facilitating low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy in the presence of a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) inhibitor. In addition, the behaviors and mechanism of NIR laser&#8208;triggered molecular motions for generating heat  via  the nonradiative CI pathway have been further understood by theoretical and experimental evidence, providing a feasible design principle to synthesize highly efficient photothermal and photoacoustic agents.</dc:description>

However, the identification of functional groups or reagents that are mutually reactive with one another, but unreactive with biopolymers and water, is challenging. Here we show that cobalt catalysts will react with alkenes under dilute, aqueous, buffered conditions and promote efficient cycloisomerization and formal Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. We find the constraining conditions of biorthogonal chemistry to be beneficial for reaction efficiency as we obtain superior conversion at low catalyst concentration and maintain competent rates in dilute conditions. Efficiency at high dilution in the presence of buffer and nucleobases suggests that these conditions may find broad application.&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

However, the identification of functional groups or reagents that are mutually reactive with one another, but unreactive with biopolymers and water, is challenging. Here we show that cobalt catalysts will react with alkenes under dilute, aqueous, buffered conditions and promote efficient cycloisomerization and formal Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. We find the constraining conditions of biorthogonal chemistry to be beneficial for reaction efficiency as we obtain superior conversion at low catalyst concentration and maintain competent rates in dilute conditions. Efficiency at high dilution in the presence of buffer and nucleobases suggests that these conditions may find broad application.&amp;lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;o:p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/o:p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Chemistry for Incorporation of Selenium into DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional direct C&#8208;H selenylation suffers from simple selenation with limited atom economy and complicated reaction system. In this work, we designed benzoselenazolone as a novel bifunctional selenide reagent for both off&#8208; and on&#8208;DNA C&#8208;H selenylation under rhodium(III) catalysis. We showed that using benzoselenazolone allowed production of a series of selenylation products containing an adjacent aminoacyl group in a fast and efficient way, with high atom economy. The synthetic application of this method was demonstrated by taking advantage of the amide functionality as a nucleophile, directing group, and amide coupling partner. This work shows great potential in facilitating rapid construction of selenium&#8208;containing DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (SeDELs), and lays the foundation for the development of selenium&#8208;containing drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Adsorption Site Regulation to Guide Atomic Design of Ni&#8208;Ga Catalysts for Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Atomic regulation of metal catalysts has emerged as an intriguing yet challenging strategy to boost the product selectivity. Here, we report a density functional theory (DFT) guided atomic design strategy to fabricate NiGa intermetallic catalyst with the completely isolated Ni sites for superior acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against Ni5Ga3 intermetallic and Ni catalysts with the ensemble Ni sites. The completely isolated Ni sites show not only preferential acetylene &#960;&#8208;adsorption, but also enhanced ethylene desorption. Further controllable synthesis of different Ni sites is confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectrometry measurements. The prediction is also validated by the experimental results that the NiGa intermetallic catalyst shows significantly enhanced selectivity to ethylene and suppressed coke formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Monitoring H2O2 on the Surface of Single Cells with Liquid Crystal Elastomer Microspheres</title>
      <dc:description>The live&#8208;imaging of signaling molecules released from living cells is a fundamental challenge in life sciences. Herein, we synthesized liquid crystal elastomer microspheres functionalized with horse&#8208;radish peroxidase (LCEM&#8208;HRP), which can be immobilized directly on cell membrane to monitor the real&#8208;time releasing of H  2  O  2  at the single&#8208;cell level. The LCEM&#8208;HRP could report H  2  O  2  through a concentric&#8208;to&#8208;radial (C&#8208;R) transfiguration, which is due to the deprotonation of LCEM&#8208;HRP and the break of inter or intra&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding in LCEM&#8208;HRP caused by HRP&#8208;catalyzed reduction of H  2  O  2  . The level of the transfiguration of LCEM&#8208;HRP revealed the different amounts of H  2  O  2  released from cells. The estimated detection sensitivity of the LCEM&#8208;HRP immobilized on the cells was ~2.2&#215;10  &#8208;7  &#181;M for 10 min of the detection time. The cell lines and cell&#8208;cell heterogeneity was also explored from different configurations of LCEM&#8208;HRP. The LCEM&#8208;HRP presents a new approach for in situ real&#8208;time imaging of H  2  O  2  released from the living&#8208;cells and can be the basis for seeking more advanced chemical probes for imaging of various signaling molecules in the cellular microenvironment.</dc:description>

In this study, nucleophilic activation of CO  2  by complex [(NO)  2  Fe(&#956;&#8208;  Me  Pyr)  2  Fe(NO)  2  ]  2&#8211;  (  2  ,  Me  Pyr = 3&#8208;methylpyrazolate) results in the formation of CO  2  &#8208;captured complex [(NO)  2  Fe(  Me  PyrCO  2  )]  &#8211;  (  2&#8208;CO  2  ,  Me  PyrCO  2  = 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate). Single&#8208;crystal structure, spectroscopic, reactivity, and computational study unravels  2&#8208;CO  2  as a unique intermediate for reductive transformation of CO  2  promoted by Ca  2+  . Moreover, sequential reaction of  2  with CO  2  , Ca(OTf)  2  , and KC  8  established a synthetic cycle,  2  &#8594;  2&#8208;CO  2  &#8594; [(NO)  2  Fe(&#956;&#8208;  Me  Pyr)  2  Fe(NO)  2  ] (  1  ) &#8594;  2  , for selective conversion of CO  2  into oxalate. Presumably, characterization of the unprecedented intermediate  2&#8208;CO  2  may open an avenue for systematic evaluation of the effects of alternative Lewis acids on reduction of CO  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Acetic Acid by a Molecular Manganese Corrole Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The controlled electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to value added chemicals is an important strategy in terms of renewable energy technologies. Therefore, the development of efficient and stable catalysts in an aqueous environment is of great importance. In this context, we focused on synthesizing and studying a molecular Mn(III)&#8208;Corrole complex, which is modified on the three  meso  &#8208;positions with polyethylene glycol moieties for direct production of acetic acid from CO  2  in a selective manner. Electrochemical reduction of Mn(III) to a Mn(II)&#8208;electroactive species, which significantly binds CO  2  and stabilizes the reduced intermediates. This catalyst allows to electrochemically reduce CO  2  to acetic acid in a moderate acidic aqueous medium (pH 6) with a selectivity of 63% and a turn over frequency (TOF) of 8.25 h  &#8208;1  , when immobilized on a Carbon Paper (CP) electrode. In terms of high selectivity towards acetate we propose the formation and reduction of an oxalate type intermediate, stabilized at the Mn(III)&#8208;Corrole center.</dc:description>

      <title>A highly reversible cuprous mediated cathode chemistry for magnesium batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The sluggish kinetic and poor reversibility of cathode chemistry is the major challenge for magnesium (Mg) battery to achieve high volumetric capacity. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of the cuprous (Cu  +  ) as a charge carrier can decouple the magnesiation related energy storage from the cathode electrochemistry. Importantly, Cu  +  is generated from a fast equilibrium between copper selenide electrode and Mg electrolyte during standing time, rather than in the electrochemical process. A reversible chemical magnesiation/de&#8208;magnesiation can be driven by this solid/liquid equilibrium. During a typical discharge process, Cu  +  is reduced to Cu and drives the equilibrium to promote the magnesiation process. The reversible Cu to Cu  +  redox promotes the recharge process. This novel Cu  +  mediated cathode chemistry of Mg battery leads to a high reversible areal capacity of 12.5 mAh cm  &#8208;2  with high mass loading (49.1 mg/cm  2  ) of electrode. 80% capacity retention can be achieved for 200 cycles after conditioning process.</dc:description>

      <title>Amplified Self&#8208;Immolative Release of Small Molecules by Spatial Isolation of Reactive Groups on DNA&#8208;Minimal Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Triggering the release of small molecules in response to unique biomarkers is important for applications in drug delivery and biodetection. Due to typically low quantities of biomarker, amplifying release is necessary to gain appreciable responses. Nucleic acids have been used for both their biomarker recognition properties and as stimuli, notably in amplified small molecule release via nucleic acid&#8208;templated catalysis (NATC). The multiple components and reversibility of NATC, however, make it difficult to apply  in vivo  . Here, we report the first use the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for the amplified, conditional release of small molecules from standalone nanodevices. We first couple HCR with a DNA&#8208;templated reaction resulting in the amplified, immolative release of small molecules. Moreover, we integrate the HCR components into single nanodevices as DNA tracks and spherical nucleic acids, spatially isolating reactive groups until triggering. Overall, this work translates the amplification of HCR into small molecule release without the use of multiple components, and will aid its application to biosensing, imaging and drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Air&#8208;stable Oxyallyl Patterns and a Switchable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene.</title>
      <dc:description>Oxyallyl derivatives are typical elusive compounds. Even recent &#8220;stabilized&#8221; 1,3&#8208;di(amino)oxyallyls remain highly reactive and have short lifespans at room temperature. Herein, we report the synthesis and preliminary study of mesoionic pyrimidine derivatives, which feature 1,3&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)oxyallyl patterns with an unprecedented level of stabilization. Not only the latters are insensitive towards air and moisture, they are also compatible with the formation of an ancillary stable  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene moiety. As the oxyallyl pattern is proton&#8208;responsive, it allows the reversible switching of the electronic properties of the carbene, as a ligand.</dc:description>

      <title>Membrane Proteins Have Distinct Fast Internal Motion and Residual Conformational Entropy</title>
      <dc:description>For a variety of reasons, the internal motions of integral membrane proteins have largely eluded comprehensive experimental characterization. Here the fast side chain dynamics of the 7&#8208;transmembrane helix protein sensory rhodopsin II and the beta&#8208;barrel bacterial outer membrane channel protein W have been investigated in lipid bilayers and detergent micelles by solution NMR relaxation techniques. Though of quite different topologies, both proteins are found to have a similar and striking distribution of methyl&#8208;bearing amino acid side chain motion that is independent of membrane mimetic. The methyl&#8208;bearing side chains of both proteins are, on average, more dynamic in the ps&#8208;ns time regime than any soluble protein characterized to date. Approximately one third of methyl&#8208;bearing side chains in both proteins exhibit extreme rotameric averaging on this timescale. Accordingly, both proteins retain an extraordinary residual conformational entropy in the folded state, which provides a counterbalance to the absence of the hydrophobic effect that normally stabilizes the folded state of water&#8208;soluble proteins. Furthermore, the large reservoir of conformational entropy that is observed provides the potential to greatly influence the thermodynamics underlying a plethora of membrane protein functions including ligand binding, allostery and signaling.</dc:description>

      <title>Droplet precise self&#8208;splitting on patterned&#8208;adhesive surfaces for simultaneous multi&#8208;detection</title>
      <dc:description>Precise separation and localization of microdroplets are fundamental for various fields such as high&#8208;throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, and complex analytes recognition. Herein, a droplet self&#8208;splitting strategy is developed to divide the impacting droplet into predictable microdroplets and deposit them to preset spots for simultaneous multi&#8208;detection. It is demonstrated that there is no matter&#8208;exchange between these microdroplets, therefore the generated microdroplets can be manipulated independently. The droplet self&#8208;splitting is attributed to the anisotropic liquid recoiling on the patterned&#8208;adhesive surface, which is influenced by the droplet Weber number and the width of the low&#8208;adhesive stripe. A quantitative criterion is further developed to judge the droplet self&#8208;splitting capability. These findings allow us to precisely separate and distribute microdroplets, which serve as isolated micro&#8208;vessels for biological screening and chemical reactions.

      <dc:description>The cell regulates complicated signaling and metabolism through strict transcriptional, translational, and post&#8208;translational regulation. Considerable advances have been made for monitoring transcription and translation over the past few decades. Until recently, there have not been generalizable methods for assessing the effects of post&#8208;translational regulation on enzymatic activity.

      <title>Nucleobase Modifiers Identify TET Enzymes as Bifunctional DNA Dioxygenases Capable of Direct N&#8208;Demethylation</title>
      <dc:description>TET family enzymes are known for oxidation of the 5&#8208;methyl substituent on 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA. 5mC oxidation generates the stable base 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), starting an&#160;indirect, multi&#8208;step process that ends with reversion of 5mC to unmodified cytosine. While probing the nucleobase determinants of 5mC recognition, we discovered that TET enzymes are also proficient as&#160;  direct&#160;N&#8208;demethylases of cytosine bases. We find that&#160;N&#8208;demethylase activity can be readily observed on substrates lacking a 5&#8208;methyl group and, remarkably, TET enzymes can be similarly proficient in either oxidation of 5mC or demethylation of&#160;N4&#8208;methyl substituents. Our results indicate that TET enzymes can act as both direct and indirect demethylases, highlight the active&#8208;site plasticity of these&#160;Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases, and suggest activity on unexplored substrates that could reveal new TET biology.</dc:description>

      <title>An Arylazopyrazole Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as Photoswitch on Gold Surfaces: Light&#8208;Switchable Wettability, Work Function and Conductance</title>
      <dc:description>A novel photo&#8208;responsive and fully conjugated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized to combine the excellent photophysical properties of arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) with an NHC as a robust surface anchor (AAP&#8208;BIMe). The formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold was proven by ToF&#8208;SIMS and XPS and the organic film displayed a very high stability at elevated temperatures. This stability was also reflected in a high desorption energy which was determined by temperature programmed SIMS measurements. E&#8208;/Z&#8208;AAP&#8208;BIMe@Au photoisomerization resulted in reversible alterations of the surface energy (i.e. wettability), the surface potential (i.e. work function) and the conductance (i.e. resistance). The effects could be explained by the difference in dipole moment of the isomers. Furthermore, a sequential application of a dummy ligand by microcontact printing and subsequent backfilling with AAP&#8208;BIMe allowed for its patterning on gold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a photoswitchable NHC on an Au surface.

      <title>Protection Strategies Enable Selective Conversion of Biomass</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalytic conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals is fraught with low selectivity. This Minireview provides an overview of the physical and chemical protection strategies used to improve selectivity in biomass conversion and describes the potential of using protection chemistry to manipulate catalytic pathways.







Abstract
Selective and economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass components to bio&#8208;based fuels and chemicals is the major goal of biorefineries, but low yields and selectivity for fuel precursors such as sugars, furanics, and lignin&#8208;derived monomers pose significant disadvantages in process economics. In this Minireview we summarize the existing protection strategies used in biomass chemocatalytic conversion processes and focus the discussions on the mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities of each strategy. We introduce a concept of using analogous methods to manipulate biomass catalytic conversion pathways during the upgrading of carbohydrates to fuels and chemicals. This Minireview may provide new insights into the development of selective biorefining processes from a different perspective, expanding the options for selective conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals.

      <title>Chemistry of Chitosan Aerogels: Three&#8208;Dimensional Pore Control for Tailored Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Biopolymers are rapidly gaining attention as sustainable precursors for lightweight porous materials for energy&#8208;saving, pharmaceutical, catalysis, and environmental remediation applications. Chitosan is an abundant biopolymer derived from food waste with attractive properties, particularly its high biocompatibility and easy chemical processability. Here, we review the rapidly expanding literature on chitosan&#8208;based porous materials with a focus on the gelation mechanisms, the three&#8208;dimensional multiscale structural control, and the diverse chemical functionality not accessible by other biopolymers. The properties vary widely: from supercritically dried, mesoporous chitosan aerogels to very light, freeze&#8208;dried macroporous scaffolds. Porous chitosan reaches impressive performance at laboratory scale, but the highly (meso)porous nature amplifies not only the beneficial functionality of chitosan, but also its drawbacks, leading to a serious barrier to industrialization. In order to facilitate technology transfer, we critically discuss the practical feasibility of potential chitosan aerogel applications compared to conventional and other biopolymer&#8208;based porous or nonporous materials.</dc:description>

From that perspective, the development of metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) may address these shortcomings by incorporating active metal species atop highly stable COF backbones. This minireview will highlight meritorious examples of MCOFs that tackle important issues from their design, synthesis, characterization to cutting&#8208;edge applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chiroptical Helices of N&#8208;terminal Aryl Amino Acids Adaptive to Orthogonal Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to peptide sequences, individual amino acids have long been identified as unfavorable candidates in fabricating functional helical structures from atomic to nanoscale due to the deficient H&#8208;bonding sites, thus limiting their applications such as optics and chiral sensing. By modified fused aryl groups at  N  &#8208;terminal, we found amino acids self&#8208;assembled into helical structures at atomic&#8208;level that could be incorporated into the modularized, ternary coassembly chiral systems whose supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties including circularly polarized light absorption and luminescence were precisely programmed. In the solid&#8208;states,  N  &#8208;terminal aryl amino acids (alanine and phenylglycine) appended with pyrene segments self&#8208;assembled into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;like structures induced by asymmetrical H&#8208;bonds between carboxylic acid and amide segments, further inducing supramolecular tilted chirality of achiral aryl groups. These building units were capable of binding melamine and electron deficient building block  via  duplex H&#8208;bonds and charge&#8208;transfer interactions in an orthogonal way. Complexation in binary coassemblies arouses significant chiroptical variations. Charge&#8208;transfer interaction enhances the dissymmetry g&#8208;factor of absorption (g  abs  ) by 1~2 order of magnitudes (up to 1.4&#215;10  &#8208;2  ) with extended Cotton effect active region (from 250 nm to 600 nm). Incorporating melamine pronouncedly inverts the handedness of circularly polarized luminescence, and selectively boosts the dissymmetry g&#8208;factor (g  lum  ). Melamine also induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality at nanoscale, whereby two dimensional lamellar structures from aryl amino acids are transformed into one dimensional helices at nanoscale. Exclusively, aryl phenylglycine synergistically integrate melamine and charge&#8208;transfer species into ternary component complexes, which self&#8208;assembled into giant tubular structures at microscale  via  helical scrolling process.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermoplastic Membranes Incorporating Semiconductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as a New Generation of Flexible X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
      <dc:description>Semiconductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)      recently  emerge in the applications of chemical sensors, electrocatalysts, energy storage materials and electronic devices. However,  trials  of semiconductive MOFs for flexible electronics  have yet to  be implemented.

The semiconductive MOF based flexible detectors exhibit efficient  X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;electric current conversion  with enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low trap density over the pelleted devices. A superior X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 65.86 &#181;CGy  air  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  is achieved, which notably outperforms  the pelleted devices and more importantly the commercial flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOFs based flexible detectors can be operated under multiple bending angles without  deteriorating  detection performance.

      <title>Reversibly thermosecreting organogels with switchable lubrication and anti&#8208;icing performance</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic gels with switchable interfacial properties have great potential in smart devices and controllable transport. Herein, we design an organogel by incorporating a binary liquid mixture with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) into a polymer network, resulting in reversible modulation of lubrication and adhesion properties. As the temperature changes, the lubricating mechanism changes reversibly from boundary lubrication to hydrodynamic lubrication due to the phase separation within the binary solution permeating the gel (friction coefficient from 0.4 to 0.03). Droplets appear on the gel surface at low temperature and disappear when the temperature is higher than the critical phase separation temperature (T  ps  ) of organogel. This organogel possesses a relatively low ice adhesive strength (less than 1 kPa). This material has potential applications in anti&#8208;icing and smart devices, and we believe that this design strategy can be expanded to other systems such as aqueous solution and hydrogels.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrolyte Solvation Manipulation Enables Unprecedented Room&#8208;Temperature Calcium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) provide a promising option for high&#8208;energy and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology beyond current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the development of room&#8208;temperature CMBs is significantly impeded by the poor reversibility and short lifespan of calcium metal anode. Herein we report a solvation manipulation strategy to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of calcium metal anode by enhancing the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of calcium ions in the electrolyte.  The introduction of lithium salt greatly changes the electrolyte structure by reducing coordination number of calcium ions in the first solvation shell.  As a result, an unprecedented Coulombic efficiency (CE) of calcium metal anode for galvanostatic plating/stripping is achieved up to 99.1%, accompanying with a very stable long&#8208;term cycling performance over 200 cycles at room temperature. This work may open up a new opportunity for developing practical calcium metal batteries.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) provide a promising option for high&#8208;energy and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology beyond current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the development of room&#8208;temperature CMBs is significantly impeded by the poor reversibility and short lifespan of calcium metal anode. Herein we report a solvation manipulation strategy to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of calcium metal anode by enhancing the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of calcium ions in the electrolyte.  The introduction of lithium salt greatly changes the electrolyte structure by reducing coordination number of calcium ions in the first solvation shell.  As a result, an unprecedented Coulombic efficiency (CE) of calcium metal anode for galvanostatic plating/stripping is achieved up to 99.1%, accompanying with a very stable long&#8208;term cycling performance over 200 cycles at room temperature. This work may open up a new opportunity for developing practical calcium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Unexpected Correlation Between Boron Chain Condensation and HER Activity in Highly Active Vanadium Borides: Enabling Predictions</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal borides (TMBs) have recently attracted attention as excellent hydrogen evolution (HER) electrocatalysts in bulk crystalline materials. Here, we show for the first time that VB and V  3  B  4  have high electrocatalytic HER activity. Furthermore, we show that the HER activity (in 0.5 M H  2  SO  4  ) increases with increasing boron chain condensation in vanadium borides: Using a &#8208;23 mV overpotential decrement derived from &#8208;0.296 mV (for VB at &#8209;10 mA/cm  2  current density) and &#8208;0.273 mV (for V  3  B  4  ) we accurately predict the overpotential of VB  2  (&#8208;0.204 mV) as well&#160; as that of unstudied V  2  B  3  (&#8208;0.250 mV) and hypothetical &#8220;V  5  B  8  &#8221; (&#8208;0.227 mV). We then derived an exponential equation that predicts the overpotentials of known and hypothetical V  x  B  y  phases containing at least a boron chain. These results provide a direct correlation between crystal structure and HER activity, thus paving the way for the design of even better electrocatalytic materials through structure&#8208;activity relationships.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge Transfer State Induced by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) in a Compact Spiro Electron Donor/Acceptor Dyad</title>
      <dc:description>We prepared conceptually novel, fully rigid, spiro compact electron donor (Rhodamine B, lactam form)/acceptor (naphthalimide) orthogonal dyad to attain the long&#8208;lived triplet charge transfer (3CT) state, based on the electron spin control using spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). Transient absorption (TA) spectra indicate the first charge separation (CS) takes place within 2.5 ps, subsequent SOCT&#8208;ISC takes 8 ns to produce the 3NI* state. Then the slow secondary CS (125 ns) gives the long&#8208;lived 3CT state (0.94 microseconds in deaerated n&#8208;hexane) with high energy level (ca. 2.12 eV). The cascade photophysical processes of the dyad upon photoexcitation are summarized as 1NI*&#8208;&#8208;&gt;1CT&#8208;&#8208;&gt;3NI*&#8208;&#8208;&gt;3CT. With time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra, an EEEAAA electron&#8208;spin polarization pattern was observed for the naphthalimide&#8208;localized triplet state. Our spiro compact dyad structure and the electron spin&#8208;control approach is different as compared to previous methods for which invoking transition&#8208;metal coordination or chromophores with intrinsic ISC ability is mandatory. This new method of accessing long&#8208;lived 3CT states is useful for artificial photosynthesis, photovoltaics, photocatalysis and fundamental photochemistry studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Application and Structural Analysis of Triazole&#8208;Bridged Disulfide Mimetics in Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>Ruthenium&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) is an emerging tool for organic and medicinal chemistry that provides access to 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole motifs for applications in peptide engineering.

The reported examples are not only stable enough to be observed (putative transient diborane(4) azides previously reported by our group spontaneously decompose at room temperature), but some of them are even stable enough to undergo controlled pyrolysis without explosive decomposition at temperatures well above 100 &#176;C.

      <title>Expanding the Versatility of Microbial Transglutaminase Using &#945;&#8208;Effect Nucleophiles as Noncanonical Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>The substrate promiscuity of microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been exploited in various applications in biotechnology, in particular for the attachment of alkyl amines to glutamine&#8208;containing peptides and proteins. Here we expand the substrate repertoire to include hydrazines, hydrazides, and alkoxyamines, resulting in the formation of isopeptide bonds with varied susceptibilities to hydrolysis or exchange by mTG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple unsubstituted hydrazine and dihydrazides can be used to install reactive hydrazide handles onto the side chain of internal glutamine residues. The distinct hydrazide handles can be further coupled with carbonyls, including ortho&#8208;carbonylphenylboronic acids, to form site&#8208;specific and functional bioconjugates with tunable hydrolytic stability.

      <title>Silver&#8208;Triggered Activity of a Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst in Oxidative Carbonylation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Silver bullet: A silver&#8208;triggered heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of allene amides was developed for the one&#8208;pot construction of pyrrolidones and polycyclic compounds with multiple chiral centers. The heterogeneous catalyst (Pd&#8208;AmP&#8208;CNC) can be recycled at least nine times without loss of activity. The Ag salt removes Cl from Pd&#8208;AmP&#8208;CNC to generate highly active PdII, which results in high efficiency of the heterogeneous catalytic system.







Abstract
A silver&#8208;triggered heterogeneous Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation has been developed. This heterogeneous process exhibits high efficiency and good recyclability, and was utilized for the one&#8208;pot construction of polycyclic compounds with multiple chiral centers. AgOTf was used to remove chloride ions in the heterogeneous catalyst Pd&#8208;AmP&#8208;CNC, thereby generating highly active PdII, which results in high efficiency of the heterogeneous catalytic system.

      <title>Formation of Azulene&#8208;Embedded Nanographene: Naphthalene to Azulene Rearrangement During the Scholl Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Shifting groups: An unprecedented naphthalene to azulene rearrangement reaction was observed during the Scholl reaction. And an arenium ion mediated 1,2&#8208;phenyl shift also took place. Combined these steps lead to azulene&#8208;embedded nanographene structures having azulene&#8208;like electronic and physical properties.







Abstract
Incorporation of a non&#8208;hexagonal ring into a nanographene framework can lead to new electronic properties. During the attempted synthesis of naphthalene&#8208;bridged double [6]helicene and heptagon&#8208;containing nanographene by the Scholl reaction, an unexpected azulene&#8208;embedded nanographene and its triflyloxylated product were obtained, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and 2D NMR spectroscopy. A 5/7/7/5 ring&#8208;fused substructure containing two formal azulene units is formed, but only one of them shows an azulene&#8208;like electronic structure. The formation of this unique structure is explained by arenium ion mediated 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration and a naphthalene to azulene rearrangement reaction according to an in&#8208;silico study. This report represents the first experimental example of the thermodynamically unfavorable naphthalene to azulene rearrangement and may lead to new azulene&#8208;based molecular materials.

      <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Substituted Tetraphenylethylenes Functionalized with Alkyl Chains as Autophagy Modulators for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Brought to light: Pyridinium&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethylene salts PTPE 1&#8211;3 induce autophagy and simultaneously inhibit autophagy flux. PTPE 1&#8211;3 forms stable complexes with albumin that function as drug delivery vehicles able to target and penetrate cancer cells. PTPE 1&#8211;3 are aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens, which allow monitoring of the targeting and therapy processes by fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Tuning autophagy in a controlled manner could facilitate cancer therapy but it remains challenging. Pyridinium&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethylene salts (PTPE 1&#8212;3), able to target mitochondria and disrupt autophagy after forming complexes with albumin, are reported. Mitochondrion affinity and autophagy&#8208;inducing activity are improved by prolonging the length of alkyl chains in PTPE 1&#8211;3. PTPE 1&#8211;3 demonstrate proautophagic activity and a mitophagy blockage effect. Failure of autophagosome&#8211;lysosome fusion in downstream autophagy flux results in cancer cell death. Moreover, fast formation of complexes of PTPE 1&#8211;3 with albumin in blood can facilitate biomimetic delivery and deep tumor penetration. Efficient tumor accumulation and effective tumor suppression are successfully demonstrated with in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies. PTPE 1&#8211;3 salts exhibit dual functionality: they target and image mitochondria because of aggregation&#8208;induced emission effects and they are promising for cancer therapy.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Aminocyclopropenium Salts: En&#8197;Route to Deltic Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Cyclopropenium&#8208;based liquid crystals form lamellar or columnar mesophases, depending on the substitution of head group and the number of peripheral chains. The effective volume of headgroup versus hydrophobic part determines the mesophase type. These compounds bridge the gap between low molecular weight organocatalysts and polymeric electrolytes based on cyclopropenium.







Abstract
Aminocyclopropenium ions have raised much attention as organocatalysts and redox active polymers. However, the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic aminocyclopropenium ions remains challenging. The first deltic ionic liquid crystals based on aminocyclopropenium ions have been developed. Differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction provided insight into the unique self&#8208;assembly and nanosegregation of these liquid crystals. While the combination of small headgroups with linear p&#8208;alkoxyphenyl units led to bilayer&#8208;type smectic mesophases, wedge&#8208;shaped units resulted in columnar mesophases.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyclopropenium&#8208;based liquid crystals&lt;/b&gt; form lamellar or columnar mesophases, depending on the substitution of head group and the number of peripheral chains. The effective volume of headgroup versus hydrophobic part determines the mesophase type. These compounds bridge the gap between low molecular weight organocatalysts and polymeric electrolytes based on cyclopropenium.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aminocyclopropenium ions have raised much attention as organocatalysts and redox active polymers. However, the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic aminocyclopropenium ions remains challenging. The first deltic ionic liquid crystals based on aminocyclopropenium ions have been developed. Differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction provided insight into the unique self&#8208;assembly and nanosegregation of these liquid crystals. While the combination of small headgroups with linear &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkoxyphenyl units led to bilayer&#8208;type smectic mesophases, wedge&#8208;shaped units resulted in columnar mesophases. Upon increasing the size and polyphilicity of the aminocyclopropenium headgroup, a lamellar phase was formed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Judicious Choice of N&#8208;Heterocycles for the Realization of Sky&#8208;Blue&#8208; to Green&#8208;Emitting Carbazolylgold(III) C^C^N Complexes and Their Applications for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Blue skies over green fields: Sky&#8208;blue to green emission has been realized in a new class of carbazolylgold(III) complexes with the judicious choice of N&#8208;heterocycles in the C^C^N ligand. The complexes have been used to fabricate both vacuum&#8208;deposited and solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices, in which the green&#8208;emitting devices realize a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.3&#8201;%, with an operational half&#8208;life of over 5300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
A new class of sky&#8208;blue&#8208; to green&#8208;emitting carbazolylgold(III) C^C^N complexes containing pyrazole or benzimidazole moieties has been successfully designed and synthesized. Through the judicious choice of the N&#8208;heterocycles in the cyclometalating ligand and the tailor&#8208;made carbazole moieties, maximum photoluminescence quantum yields of 0.52 and 0.39 have been realized in the green&#8208; and sky&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting complexes, respectively. Solution&#8208;processed and vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) based on the benzimidazole&#8208;containing complexes have been prepared. The sky&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting device shows an emission peaking at 484&#8197;nm with a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 57&#8197;nm (2244&#8197;cm&#8722;1), demonstrating the potential of this class of complexes in the application of OLEDs with high color purity. In addition, high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 12.3&#8201;% and a long operational half&#8208;lifetime of over 5300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 have been achieved in the vacuum&#8208;deposited green&#8208;emitting devices.

      <title>Pyridinium Salts as Redox&#8208;Active Functional Group Transfer Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>
Pick your pyridinium: N&#8208;Functionalized pyridinium salts have emerged as versatile reagents for the redox&#8208;triggered liberation of a wide variety of radical species for diverse synthetic applications. This Review highlights recent advances and discusses mechanistic aspects of the key fragmentation process.







Abstract
In this Review, we highlight recent advances in the understanding and design of N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium scaffolds as redox&#8208;active, single&#8208;electron, functional group transfer reagents. We provide a selection of representative methods that demonstrate reactivity and fundamental advances in this emerging field. The reactivity of these reagents can be divided into two divergent pathways: homolytic fragmentation to liberate the N&#8208;bound substituent as the corresponding radical or an alternative heterolytic fragmentation that liberates an N&#8208;centered pyridinium radical. A short description of the elementary steps involved in fragmentation induced by single&#8208;electron transfer is also critically discussed to guide readers towards fundamental processes thought to occur under these conditions.

      <title>Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation in Photoredox Catalysis: Concepts, Applications, Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Two are better than one: By combining the input from two low energy photons, thermodynamically very challenging reactions can be driven. Empirical advances combined with insights from spectroscopy have made multi&#8208;photon excitation processes amenable to preparative&#8208;scale photoredox chemistry. A critical look at currently developed concepts and reactions identifies challenges, pitfalls and opportunities for future research.







Abstract
The energy of visible photons and the accessible redox potentials of common photocatalysts set thermodynamic limits to photochemical reactions that can be driven by traditional visible&#8208;light irradiation. UV excitation can be damaging and induce side reactions, hence visible or even near&#8208;IR light is usually preferable. Thus, photochemistry currently faces two divergent challenges, namely the desire to perform ever more thermodynamically demanding reactions with increasingly lower photon energies. The pooling of two low&#8208;energy photons can address both challenges simultaneously, and whilst multi&#8208;photon spectroscopy is well established, synthetic photoredox chemistry has only recently started to exploit multi&#8208;photon processes on the preparative scale. Herein, we have a critical look at currently developed reactions and mechanistic concepts, discuss pertinent experimental methods, and provide an outlook into possible future developments of this rapidly emerging area.

      <title>Prismarene: An Emerging Naphthol&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Arene</title>
      <dc:description>
New macrocyclic arenes, so&#8208;called prism[n]arenes, are readily synthesized from 2,6&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene and paraformaldehyde in the presence of templates. They adopt a prism&#8208;like structure with an electron&#8208;rich cavity and show excellent binding affinities towards organic cations. In view of the simple synthesis and good host&#8211;guest chemistry, they should find many uses in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
Phenol&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes have been widely used in supramolecular chemistry, significantly enriching the toolbox of the field. In contrast, naphthol&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes are rather underdeveloped. Very recently, Gaeta and co&#8208;workers successfully synthesized such macrocycles (referred to as prism[n]arenes) with good guest&#8208;binding ability by reacting 2,6&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene with paraformaldehyde under optimized conditions. In view of the simple synthesis and good host&#8211;guest chemistry, we anticipate that this macrocycle will find similar success and wide applications as the phenol&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes.

      <title>Synthetic Photoelectrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Photochemistry with potential: The synergy of photochemistry and electrochemistry in organic synthesis is beneficial not only for synthetic sustainability and chemical selectivity, but also in the accumulation of energy for accessing super&#8208;oxidizing or &#8208;reducing single electron transfer agents. Examples of synthetic organic photoelectrochemistry are dissected into three categories: electrochemically mediated photoredox catalysis, decoupled photoelectrochemistry, and interfacial photoelectrochemistry.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis (PRC) and synthetic organic electrochemistry (SOE) are often considered competing technologies in organic synthesis. Their fusion has been largely overlooked. We review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic organic photoelectrochemistry, grouping examples into three categories: 1)&#8197;electrochemically mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC), 2)&#8197;decoupled photoelectrochemistry (dPEC), and 3)&#8197;interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC). Such synergies prove beneficial not only for synthetic &#8220;greenness&#8221; and chemical selectivity, but also in the accumulation of energy for accessing super&#8208;oxidizing or &#8208;reducing single electron transfer (SET) agents. Opportunities and challenges in this emerging and exciting field are discussed.

      <title>Hidden Isolated OH at the Charged Hydrophobic Interface Revealed by Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterodyne&#8208;Detected VSFG Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Hidden &#960;&#8208;hydrogen bonded OH of water at negatively charged hydrophobic interfaces was revealed by two&#8208;dimensional heterodyne&#8208;detected vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;VSFG) spectroscopy. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002368), T. Tahara and co&#8208;workers show that the sign of the interfacial charge governs the structure and dynamics of water molecules facing the hydrophobic region. The picture illustrates 2D spectra tracking femtosecond hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of water at charged hydrophobic interfaces.

      <title>In&#8197;Vitro Selection of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Degraded Protein Fragments for Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>
A DNA aptamer targeting naturally degraded protein fragments was selected by M. Liu, J.&#8197;D. Brennan, Y. Li and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000025). The aptamer binds a degraded form of toxin B from&#160;Clostridium difficile&#160;and can detect this protein fragment in human stool. The method offers a way to discover DNA aptamers that can not be selected using purified proteins, thus expanding the practical utility of DNA aptamers in clinical diagnosis.
