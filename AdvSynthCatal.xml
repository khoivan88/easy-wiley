      <title>Photoredox Catalyst Free, Visible Light&#8208;Promoted C3&#8722;H Acylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in Water</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through visible&#8208;light promoted decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;carboxylic acids with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones was developed. The reaction was performed in aqueous phase and photoredox catalyst was not required to run the process.

      <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Dehydrogenative Coupling &#8211; An Overview</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;catalysed reactions have attracted great attention recently due to the high relative abundance and cheap and eco&#8208;friendly behaviour. Applications of manganese catalysis in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling are among the hottest areas since 90% of the contributions are very recent. Dehydrogenation of alcohols using Mn&#8208;pincer systems is highly explored nowadays for cross&#8208;coupling to synthesise a variety of products and Mn&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation, and radical reactions are applied in dehydrogenative couplings of various synthons. This review focuses on the synthesis of synthetically as well as biologically important motifs such as carbonyl compounds, olefins, nitrogen heterocycles, amines, imines, etc. using manganese&#8208;catalysed dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Dehydrogenation of alcohols using Mn&#8208;pincer systems is highly explored nowadays for cross&#8208;coupling to synthesise a variety of products and Mn&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation, and radical reactions are applied in dehydrogenative couplings of various synthons. This review focuses on the synthesis of synthetically as well as biologically important motifs such as carbonyl compounds, olefins, nitrogen heterocycles, amines, imines, etc. using manganese&#8208;catalysed dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cyanation of Cyclopropanols and Cyclopropanone Acetals</title>
      <dc:description>A novel approach for enantioselective cyanation of cyclopropanols and their derivatives through copper&#8208;catalyzed radical relay processes has been developed. Various cyclopropanols and cyclopropanone acetals are compatible to the catalytic conditions, providing &#946;&#8208;carbonyl nitriles with excellent enantioselectivity. These products can be readily converted to chiral &#947;&#8208;amino acids derivatives and drugs such as (R)&#8208;baclofen.

      <title>Enantioselective One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes via Allylic Substitution and Oxidative Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
An enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes from allyl carbonates and propargyl amines is reported. An amine catalyst promoted the allylic substitution to form intermediary N&#8208;allyl propargylamines, which underwent enantioselective Pd(II)/Pd(IV)&#8208;mediated oxidative cyclization in&#8197;situ. The chiral ligand (P,R,R)&#8208;i&#8208;Pr&#8208;SPRIX is crucial to the cyclization, producing the desired bicyclic compounds in up to 92% yield and 90% ee.

Abstract
Here, a mild and general oxidative radical relay carbocyclization reaction with 2&#8208;arylbenzoimidazoles and cyclic ethers is reported. This method provides an efficient access to a wide range of structurally diverse benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones under metal&#8208;free conditions. The wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and scale&#8208;up operation of this method are expected to promote its potential applications in biotechnology and pharmacy.

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Remote meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation by Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Steric hindrance is usually the only determining factor in controlling the enantioselectivity of a reaction. Here, we disclose a different way in which steric hindrance and electronic properties cooperate to control the transformation enantioselectivity. In this study, palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective remote meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation and alkylation via a chiral transient mediator was investigated to elucidate the mechanistic details and essence of the excellent enantioselectivity by using density functional theory methods. The calculations indicate that the deprotonation process is the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction, whereas norbornene insertion is most likely the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Although transition state structure analysis indicates that steric hindrance indeed contributes to this enantioselectivity, its individual action is insufficient to account for the excellent S&#8208;configuration selectivity. The electronic nature of substituents on the C=C double bond of norbornene as a chiral transient mediator plays a crucial role in this enantioselective conversion. A weak electron&#8208;withdrawing group is favorable for enantioselectivity, whereas strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups are exactly the opposite. Computations reveal that a weak electron&#8208;withdrawing group slightly lowers the charge density of the chiral norbornene C=C double bond, resulting in a decrease in reactivity. Especially, for the R&#8208;configuration, the insertion reaction energy barrier increases to approximately 29.3&#8197;kcal/mol. Such a high barrier is commensurate with that of the S&#8208;configuration rate&#8208;determining step (28.2&#8197;kcal/mol), thereby preventing the formation of R&#8208;configuration products and ultimately determining the enantioselectivity of the protocol.

&lt;p&gt;Steric hindrance is usually the only determining factor in controlling the enantioselectivity of a reaction. Here, we disclose a different way in which steric hindrance and electronic properties cooperate to control the transformation enantioselectivity.

      <title>Synthesis of Benzo[b]thiophenes through Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reaction using Elemental Sulfur</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A benzo[b]thiophene synthesis by Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction of arylboronic acids, alkynes, and elemental sulfur (S8) is developed. A notable feature of this protocol is that the thienannulation (thiophene annulation) proceeds with high regioselectivity via the sequential alkyne insertion, C&#8722;H activation, and then sulfur atom transfer to the metallacycle intermediate. In a similar manner, dibenzothiophenes can be synthesized from the parent biarylboronic acids and S8.

      <title>Synthesis of Eight&#8208;Membered Nitrogen Heterocycles via a Heterogeneous PtI2&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cycloaddition Reaction of &#948;&#8208;Aminoalkynes with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel heterogeneous PtI2&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of &#948;&#8208;aminoalkynes was developed for the synthesis of various eight&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles in excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via a hydration of &#948;&#8208;aminoalkynes and subsequent intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition as well as ring&#8208;expansion cascade reaction with another electron&#8208;deficient alkynes. This method has the advantages of simple operation and mild reaction conditions. And the simple PtI2 with no any supports could be readily recycled through simple centrifugation without substantial loss of activity in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE). The recyclability of PtI2 may be ascribed to its insolubility in DCE. The reaction constitutes a formal [6+2]&#8208;cycloaddition.

      <title>A Thermomorphic Polyethylene&#8208;Supported Imidazolium Salt for the Fixation of CO2 into Cyclic Carbonates</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An imidazolium catalyst supported on thermomorphic polyethylene (PE) was prepared from 1&#8208;methylimidazole and polyethylene iodide (PE&#8722;I). The catalyst was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, SEC and MALDI&#8208;ToF mass spectrometry. Its catalytic activity was evaluated in the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides with carbon dioxide to give cyclic carbonates under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The catalyst proved to be active at low catalyst loading (down to 0.1&#8197;mol%) and allows the reaction to occur at low CO2 pressure (1&#8211;5&#8197;bar) and moderate temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C). A range of terminal and internal epoxides was converted to the corresponding cyclic carbonates with high yields and selectivities. The recyclability of the catalyst was studied and no significant loss of activity was observed after 5 runs.

      <title>From Phenylhydrazone to 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles via Nitrification, Reduction and Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we report an annulation of phenylhydrazone via a tandem nitrification, reduction, cyclization protocol employing cobalt nitrate and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to produce substituted 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. Notably, 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane serves both the solvent and a hydrogen source for transfer hydrogenation. This methodology works under mild conditions, providing a direct approach for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, two kinds of structurally significant 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles were selectively generated by the copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic C&#8722;C bond cleavage of isatins. Morpholine served not only as a reactant but a promoter in the three&#8208;component assembly of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles. Also it proved to be an efficient additive for the formation of free amino 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles. This protocol represents a step&#8208;economic entry to the title compounds with a range of compatible functionalities.

Abstract
A green and efficient regioselective dehydrative Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of trifluorinated 3&#8208;indolyl(2&#8208;thiophenyl) methanols with 2&#8208;substituted indoles, catalyzed by DBSA (dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid) in water is described. This simple and atom&#8208;economical protocol features a unique regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition, operational simplicity, mild conditions, excellent functional group compatibility, and environmental benignity.

      <title>Phosphoramidates as Transient Precursors of Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation: Application to the Synthesis of Phthalazine Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Phosphoramidates are for the first time presented as efficient N&#8208;Centered Radical (NCR) precursors under visible&#8208;light irradiation. More precisely among this class of phosphorus&#8208;derived compounds, we studied the radical reactivity of phosphonohydrazones, under mild reaction conditions, which allowed the synthesis of a wide and diversified library of the scarcely reported phthalazine scaffold. Mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of a NCR from these brand&#8208;new phosphonohydrazones (derivatived from phosphoramidates), which were further engaged in an intramolecular 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to provide phthalazines. Compared to other pre&#8208;activated moieties, the phosphoramidate group is self&#8208;immolative, thus enhancing its attractiveness for the C&#8722;N bond formation.

      <title>Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridazines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Carboamination of Alkenyl Hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
We report herein a facile approach to tetrahydropyridazines, a scaffold found in many natural products and biologically active entities, via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carboamination of readily available alkenyl hydrazones with aryl and alkenyl halides. Preliminary studies showed its promise for enantioselective synthesis. This work offers an expedient access to the tetrahydropyridazine scaffold bearing substitution patterns, thus significantly increasing the availability of these derivatives for downstream evaluation.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Impregnated Magnesium&#8208;Lanthanum Mixed Oxide: A Reusable Heterogeneous Catalyst for Allylation of Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Copper&#8208;impregnated magnesium&#8208;lanthanum mixed oxide [Cu(II)/Mg&#8722;La] was used as catalyst in synthesis of homoallylic alcohols from aldehydes and ketones using allyltributylstannane as the allylating source. The present protocol provides a great application potential for the synthesis of corresponding allyl alcohols with excellent yields and selectivity. The catalyst exhibits broad functional group compatibility with a variety of substituted aldehydes and ketones to furnish the desired products in high yields under heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the heterogeneous catalyst could be recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and used up to three cycles.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
Reported is a highly enantioselective Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed endo&#8208;selective C&#8722;H annulation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridone, and 4&#8208;pyrimidone with alkenes to provide drug&#8208;relevant bicyclic heterocycle products. The use of a readily prepared chiral bulky NHC ligand (SIPE) for Ni catalyst and commercially available AlEt3 as co&#8208;catalyst enhanced the practicality of this reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Reported is a highly enantioselective Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H annulation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridone, and 4&#8208;pyrimidone with alkenes to provide drug&#8208;relevant bicyclic heterocycle products. The use of a readily prepared chiral bulky NHC ligand (SIPE) for Ni catalyst and commercially available AlEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as co&#8208;catalyst enhanced the practicality of this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <dc:description>








Abstract
Access to unprotected 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;glycals via a mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyanation of protecting groups&#8208;free 2&#8208;iodoglycals in aqueous media has been developed. Diverse glycal substrates including disaccharide&#8208;type were successfully obtained in good to excellent yields. These unprotected 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;glycal scaffolds were successfully derivatized to different C2&#8208;glycoanalogues.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
Blue light irradiation of aryldiazoacetates leads to the formation of free carbenes, which can react with carbazoles, pyrazoles and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles to afford the corresponding N&#8722;H inserted products. These reactions are performed under air and at room temperature, allowing the mild preparation of a variety of motifs found in biologically relevant targets.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated Cyclization of 1,3&#8208;Diynyl Propargyl Aryl Ethers with Dibutyl Diselenide: Synthesis of Selenophene&#8208;Fused Chromenes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of selenophene&#8208;fused chromene derivatives starting from 1,3&#8208;diynyl propargyl aryl ethers is reported herein. The method is based on carbon&#8208;carbon, carbon&#8208;selenium, selenium&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;selenium bonds formation in a one&#8208;pot protocol, using iron(III) chloride and dibutyl diselenide as promoters. The same reaction conditions were applied to propargyl anilines leading to the formation of 1&#8208;(butylselanyl)&#8208;selenophene quinolines. The results showed that the dilution and temperature of substrate addition had a crucial influence in the products obtained. When the substrates were added at room temperature, in the absence of a solvent, a mixture of products was obtained, whereas the slowly addition (15&#8197;min) of starting materials, as a dichloromethane solution, at 0&#8201;&#176;C led to the product formation in good yields. The mechanistic study indicates that the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and dibutyl diselenide was essential to promote the cyclization, whereas separately none of them was effective in promoting the cyclization. We proved the synthetic utility of heterocycles obtained in the Suzuki cross coupling reaction, giving the corresponding cross&#8208;coupled products in good yields. In addition, the organoselenium moiety was removed from the structures of products by using n&#8208;butyllithium.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient biocatalytic approach for enantio&#8208; and regioselective ring&#8208;opening of styrene oxides with cyanate was developed by using the halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, generating the corresponding chiral 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones in up to 47% yield and 90% ee. Additionally, the origin of enantioselectivity and regioselectivity of the HheC&#8208;catalyzed cyanate&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process was uncovered by single enantiomer bioconversions and molecular docking study.

Abstract
Direct electrochemical oxidative functionalization of caffeine under metal&#8208;free and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free conditions was achieved. Nucleophiles such as various substituted pyrazoles, alcohols, and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate can be utilized with high diastereoselectivity for the dearomatizative functionalization of caffeine. In addition, selective C2 functionalization of caffeine has also been realized with the modification of solvent and reaction time. A gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrates the potential application in the derivatization of caffeine.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
An approach for iodofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkynes and alkenes facilitated by an earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive manganese catalyst, Mn2(CO)10, is reported. This protocol employs visible light as the energy input and shows a wide substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group compatibility. A variety of synthetically useful fluoroalkylated alkyl and alkenyl iodides can be prepared in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction features high efficiency, operational simplicity, scalability, as well as excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and E/Z selectivities.

      <title>Application of Transaminases in a Disperse System for the Bioamination of Hydrophobic Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The challenging bioamination of hydrophobic substrates has been attained through the employment of a disperse system consisting of a combination of a low polarity solvent (e.&#8201;g. isooctane or methyl&#8208;tert&#8208;butylether), a non&#8208;ionic surfactant and a minimal amount of water. In these conditions, amine transaminases (ATA) were shown to efficiently carry out the reductive amination of variously substituted cyclohexanones, providing good conversions often coupled with a superior stereoselectivity if compared with the corresponding chemical reductive amination. An array of synthetically useful 4&#8208;substituted aminocyclohexanes was consequentially synthesized through biocatalysis, analyzed and stereochemically characterized.

      <title>Chemodivergent Preparation of Various Heterocycles via Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis: Enantioselective Synthesis of Functionalized Piperidines</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
In this work, a new chemodivergent domino approach for the preparation of various saturated heterocycles, based on phase&#8208;transfer catalysis (PTC), is presented. The versatile nature of doubly electrophilic substrates, showing both a Michael acceptor and a ketone, tethered by a heteroatom, enables three different domino reaction pathways. The nucleophile dictates the chemoselectivity of the reaction. Sulfa&#8208;Michael/aldol, cyanide addition/oxa&#8208;Michael and Michael/H&#8208;shift/aldol processes, along with the variation of the tethering heteroatom, results in the formation of six different classes of saturated heterocycles. DFT calculations account for the observed chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the two most productive processes. Moreover, an extensive investigation on the sulfa&#8208;Michael/aldol pathway was carried out, ultimately leading to the development of a new enantioselective domino approach to multi&#8208;substituted piperidines based on PTC.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare cycloalkyl&#8208; and (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives from gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation/[5+3] cycloaddition of 1,4,9&#8208; and 1,4,10&#8208;allenenynes is described. The suggested double cycloisomerization mechanism delineates the first example of a stepwise [5+3] cycloaddition pathway in gold catalysis, a mode of reactivity that is also sparse in organic chemistry. Experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational studies based on a proposed gold carbenoid species provides insight into this unique selectivity that leads to the assembly of the architecturally challenging bridged carbocyclic motif.

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of weakly coordinating aldehydes remains limited to precious metals such as Ir, Rh, Ru, etc. Herein, we put forward a novel report on ortho&#8208;amidation of benzaldehydes employing user&#8208;friendly dioxazolones under cost&#8208;effective and air&#8208;stable Cp*Co(III) catalysis. This catalytic transformation involves transient directing group strategy to enhance the ligating capability of weakly chelating aldehydes.

Abstract
Herein we report the use of catalytic amount of scandium(III) triflate or indium(III) chloride (with trimethylsilyl chloride) for the functionalization of endoperoxyacetals through Sakurai or Mukaiyama reactions. These catalysts allow milder and more practical conditions than those previously reported with improvements in scope and reproducibility. This method allows a full catalytic sequence from cyclopropanols to produce desired functionalized 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes.

      <title>Amino Acids: Nontoxic and Cheap Alternatives for Amines for the Synthesis of Benzoxazoles through the Oxidative Functionalization of Catechols</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The nano magnetic Fe3O4 (NM&#8722;Fe3O4) was applied for the synthesis of benzoxazoles via a C(aryl)&#8722;OH functionalization of catechol derivatives and amines in ethanol at room temperature. In the next step, amino acids have been applied as nontoxic and cheap alternatives for amines. The obtained products were similar with the regular amines case. This is the first report about the application of amino acids as alternatives for primary amines in organic synthesis. Furthermore, the presented method was successfully applied toward the synthesis of desired products in large scales.

The enantiopure Ni(II) helicates [Ni2L1RR.Cl2] (1), [Ni2L1SS.Cl2] (1&#8242;), [Ni2L2RR.Cl2] (2), [Ni2L2SS.Cl2] (2&#8242;) were synthesized by one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly technique from R&#8208;(+)&#8208; or S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamine, with 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diformyl phenol or 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diformyl phenol and nickel salts. This binuclear double stranded Ni(II) helicates were characterized by ESI&#8208;MS, IR and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure wherever applicable. The extensive chiroptical studies suggest that the complexes are enantiopure in nature. The chirality transfer from ligand L1RR &amp; L2RR to Ni(II) metal centre produced &#916;&#916; geometrical chirality, while their enantiomeric counterpart L1SS &amp; L2SS produced &#923;&#923; chirality in their respective complexes.These enantiopure helicates were applied as catalysts in asymmetric Michael addition of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene to produce nitroalkanes in good yield (96&#8211;98%) and ee (78&#8211;94%).

      <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands: Syntheses and Applications in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become ligands of choice due to their remarkable catalytic activity in organic transformation reactions. Combining the chiral NHC ligand family and coinage metals became a productive area of research. The organometallic chemistry of coinage metals with the chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands is reviewed, with a special emphasis on the synthesis, characterization and possible applications obtained. Significant sections are devoted to the various recently developed coinage metal&#8208;chiral NHC complexes and a detailed comparison of their activities which aims to rationalize the structure&#8211;activity relationships. Various methods of preparations of coinage metal&#8208;chiral NHC complexes along with some typical examples of reactivity and mechanisms are covered. Cu&#8208;chiral NHC complexes involved in conjugated additions, allylic substitutions, boration of alkenes, hydrosilylation of ketones and formation of alkenes are covered, along with some remarkable examples and reactivity of Ag&#8208;chiral NHC complexes. Finally, applications of Au&#8208;chiral NHC complexes in the asymmetric cyclization of ester&#8208;functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes, 1,6&#8208;enyneamines and substituted propargyloxymethanes are also reviewed.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidations, first reported by Adolf von Baeyer and Victor Villiger 120 years ago, are highly efficient methodologies for the syntheses of esters or lactones from ketones. The asymmetric Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidations using racemic, prochiral and meso&#8208;cyclic ketones allow a rapid access to chiral lactones, which are valuable intermediates for the subsequent synthesis of bioactive compounds and natural products. The current review provides a summary on the advances in chemocatalytic enantioselective B&#8208;V oxidations. The latest achievements in this field and their applications are presented.

      <title>Advances in the Synthesis of Methylated Products through Indirect Approaches</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Methylation is a well&#8208;known structural modification in organic and medicinal chemistry. In addition to using conventional methylation reagents for direct methylation, indirect methylation approaches have been also successfully applied, particularly to tackle the isolation difficulty among the methylated product, the unreacted starting material, and the dimethylated by&#8208;product due to the structural similarities between them. This review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of methylated products through indirect approaches &#8211; transforming functionalized intermediates into the methylated products. The indirect methodologies surveyed in this review are useful for chemists to select appropriate methylation strategies, particularly for the challenging synthesis of methylated products at a large scale in drug discovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylation is a well&#8208;known structural modification in organic and medicinal chemistry. In addition to using conventional methylation reagents for direct methylation, indirect methylation approaches have been also successfully applied, particularly to tackle the isolation difficulty among the methylated product, the unreacted starting material, and the dimethylated by&#8208;product due to the structural similarities between them. This review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of methylated products through indirect approaches &#8211; transforming functionalized intermediates into the methylated products. The indirect methodologies surveyed in this review are useful for chemists to select appropriate methylation strategies, particularly for the challenging synthesis of methylated products at a large scale in drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sulfoxide&#8208;Promoted Chlorination of Indoles and Electron&#8208;Rich Arenes with Chlorine as Nucleophile</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient chlorination of indoles and electron&#8208;rich arenes with chlorine anion as nucleophile is described. With the use of ethyl phenyl sulfoxide as the promoter, the reaction went smoothly under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. Various indoles and electron&#8208;rich arenes are converted into the corresponding chlorinated compounds in moderate to excellent yields. A plausible interrupted Pummerer reaction mechanism was proposed without the oxidation of chloride anion. In addition, the byproduct thioether could be easily converted to the starting material sulfoxide just by a simple oxidation reaction.

      <title>cis&#8208;Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Alkynes by Merging Visible&#8208;Light Catalysis with Cobalt Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, cobalt&#8208;catalyzed transfer semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is reported. It is carried out by using Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)]PF6 as photosensitizer, CoBr2/n&#8208;Bu3P as proton&#8208;reducing catalyst, and i&#8208;Pr2NEt/AcOH as the hydrogen source. Under the established catalytic system, the semihydrogenation proceeds with Z as the major selectivity and with inhibition of over&#8208;reduction. Under mild reaction conditions, both internal and terminal alkynes, as well as reducible functional groups such as halogen, cyano, and ester, are tolerated. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the dual role of the photosensitizer in initiating the reaction via a single&#8208;electron transfer process and controlling the stereoselectivity via an energy transfer process.

Abstract
Synthesis of a wide variety of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ones from N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines via intramolecular aminocarbonylation of alkynes using Cs2CO3 as catalyst and air as oxidant has been developed. This highly atom&#8208;efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds under thermal conditions. We propose that the reaction proceeds through an unprecedented 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines and thermal rearrangement of 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;2&#955;2&#8208;isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ols.

Abstract
The enantioselective formal [2+4] annulation of 5&#8208;alkenyl thiazolones with hydroxyl&#8208;substituted para&#8208;quinone methides was disclosed by dipeptide&#8208;based phosphonium salt catalysts. A wide range of functionalized spiro&#8208;chroman&#8208;thiazolone molecules bearing three contiguous 3&#176; and/or 4&#176; stereocenters were readily constructed in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (&gt;20:1 dr and up to &gt;99.9% ee) under low catalyst loading and mild reaction conditions. The practicality and utility of this protocol were demonstrated by the scaled&#8208;up preparation and elaborations of product.

Abstract
The current report represents a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of oxazoline and isoxazoline derivatives by a tandem electro&#8208;oxidative chalcogenation&#8208;cyclization process. Both C&#8722;Se and C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming protocols were developed without using any external oxidant and the reaction was performed at room temperature, open to the air. Using this methodology, 29 substituted oxazoline and 16 substituted isoxazoline derivatives were synthesized with up to 91% isolated yield.

      <title>Harnessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of 2&#8208;Cyano&#8208;Substituted Heteroarenes to Achieve Programmable Double Alkylation</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report our study of tertiary radicals, generated through visible light decarboxylation, alkylating 2&#8208;cyanoarenes through radical cross&#8208;coupling at the ipso&#8208; or the para&#8208; positions of the cyano groups. Synthesis of a variety of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines containing quaternary centers is described. The approach enables regioselective sequential double alkylation on either 2&#8208;cyanopyridine or 2&#8208;cyanopyrimidine with high efficiency. Our report illustrates the synthetic utility of &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted tertiary radicals in the synthesis of substituted heteroarenes.

      <title>Efficient Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate [NADP(H)] Recycling in Closed&#8208;Loop Continuous Flow Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Biocatalytic redox reactions regularly depend on expensive cofactors that require recycling. For continuous conversions in flow chemistry, this is often an obstacle since the cofactor is washed away. Here, we present a quasi&#8208;stationary recycling system for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate utilizing an immobilized alcohol dehydrogenase and four model substrates were reduced with high enantioselectivity as a proof of concept. The two&#8208;phase system enables continuous production as well as quick substrate changes. This setup may serve as general cofactor regeneration module for continuous biocatalytic devices employing (co&#8208;)substrates being miscible in organic solvent. The system performed space&#8208;time yields up to 117 g L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and total turnover numbers for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate higher than 12,000 mol/mol are possible.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reactions for the Synthesis of Norbornane&#8208;Fused Indanes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Two methods for the synthesis of norbornane&#8208;fused indanes via palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reactions of iodoarenes, norbornenes, and CH2Br2 or &#945;&#8208;diazoesters have been developed. In the reactions, three C&#8722;C bonds were constructed and a wide range of norbornane&#8208;fused indanes could be synthesized. The reactions with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters proceeded with a high degree of diastereoselectivity and indanes bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center were formed. The products obtained in the reactions of 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene can be converted to fluorenes, providing an alternative way to access fluorene derivatives.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Pyrrole Functionalization by Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
1H&#8208;Pyrroles can be directly functionalized by means of the incorporation of carbene groups from diazo compounds, in a process catalyzed by TpxCu complexes (Tpx=hydrotrispyrazolylborate ligand). The reactions take place with a complete selectivity toward the formal insertion of the carbene into the C&#945;&#8722;H bond, leading to alkylated pyrroles, with no modification of the C&#946;&#8722;H, N&#8722;H or C=C bonds of the pyrrole unit. Alkyl substituents at C&#8208;ring as well as alkyl, aryl, allyl or alkyne substitution at N atom are tolerated, the strategy affording 20 new pyrrole derivatives. The observance of partial deuteration at the methylene group when the reaction is carried out with added D2O serves to discard the direct insertion of the carbene group into the Csp2&#8722;H bond, the alternative electrophilic attack to the pyrrole ring being feasible.

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminophosphine Oxides through C(sp3)&#8722;P Coupling of 2&#8208;Azaallyls</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
Radical reactions have been widely applied in C&#8722;P bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most of these strategies require initiators, transition metal catalysts, or organometallic reagents. Herein, a transition metal&#8208;free C(sp3)&#8722;P bond formation to prepare &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides via deprotonative radical coupling processes of 2&#8208;azaallyls with chlorodiphenylphosphine oxides was presented. Deprotonation of N&#8208;benzyl imines may generate super&#8208;electron&#8208;donor (SED) 2&#8208;azaallyl anions that reduced chlorodiphenylphosphine oxides to phosphine oxide radicals. Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process transformed the 2&#8208;azaallyl anions into 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which may couple with phosphine oxide radicals to construct C&#8722;P bonds. The deprotonative radical coupling approach enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides bearing various functional groups under mild conditions and without precious transition metal catalysts or oxidants.

Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation between &#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones and 2&#8208;halophenols or 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;pyridinol is presented. The annulation process involving oxa&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;elimination and intramolecular Heck reaction leading to form 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzofurans (aryl benzofuryl sulfones) in good to high yields. The regioselective tandem construction of C&#8722;O and C&#8722;C bonds has been achieved with a variety of substitution patterns. Moreover, the tandem process is reliable at gram&#8208;scale reactions and a plausible mechanism is also proposed.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
The first solvent&#8208;mediated tunable C3/C7 regio&#8208; and enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of 4&#8208;aminoindoles with &#945;&#8208;ketimino esters has been developed. This catalysis allows the highly regioselective formation of indole C3 and C7 alkylation products, both in high yields (up to 96%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Mechanism study revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions of the solvents with the catalyst played a vital role for the regioselectivity switch. Furthermore, the corresponding products are indole containing unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives bearing a quaternary stereocenter and enable many further elaborations.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Electrochemical Synthesis and Functionalization of Indole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The chemists&#8217; pursuit of the ideal synthesis and functionalization of indole derivatives has lasted over 150 years as their scaffolds have been widely found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic materials. In this regard, the recent resurgence of adopting green and sustainable electrochemistry in organic synthesis suggests that electrosynthesis is a promising strategy. Indeed, many new intriguing applications of synthesis and functionalization of indole derivatives by direct and redox&#8208;mediated electrochemical means have been disclosed. In this review, we highlight the fundamental aspects, reaction scopes, synthetic applications and reaction mechanisms of the electrochemical synthesis and functionalization of indole derivatives.

Abstract
Reported here is an alternative method for asymmetric synthesis of the CF3&#8208;substituted 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition by employing dipeptide&#8208;based chiral phosphonium salt as a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a variety of CF3&#8208;substituted 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives were readily prepared in high yields as a single diastereomer with high enantiomeric access (&gt;20:1&#8197;dr and up to 94% ee).

      <title>Aryldiazenyl Radicals from Arylazo Sulfones: Visible Light&#8208;Driven Diazenylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A versatile protocol for the diazenylation of enol silyl ethers under visible light irradiation is presented herein. The reaction is based on the underused reaction of a nitrogen&#8208;based radical (the diazenyl radical) with an enol silyl ether. Arylazo sulfones were used as photoactivatable precursors of these diazenyl radicals. The resulting azaderivatives are potentially bioactive compounds as well as starting materials for the synthesis of N&#8208;containing heterocycles.

      <title>Radical&#8208;Induced 1,2&#8208;Migrations of Boron Ate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
1,2&#8208;Boron ate rearrangements represent a fundamental class of transformations to establish new C&#8722;C bonds while retaining the valuable boron moiety in the product. In established ionic processes, the boron ate complex is activated by an external electrophile to induce a 1,2&#8208;migration from boron to an adjacent sp3 or sp2 carbon atom. Recently, two complementary radical polar crossover approaches have been explored for both classes, 1,2&#8208;migrations to sp2 and sp3 carbon centers. This review describes the general concepts in this emerging research field and summarizes recent developments of radical&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migrations from boron to carbon.

      <title>Synthesis of Benzothiazoles via Photooxidative Decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, synthesis of benzothiazoles via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;keto acids and 2&#8208;aminothiophenols under blue LED irradiation without using any photocatalyst or metal at room temperature is described. The formation of benzothiazole is driven by the EDA (electron donor&#8208;acceptor) complex formed between &#945;&#8208;keto acid and 2&#8208;aminothiophenol. This methodology gives easy access to 2&#8208;substituted and &#8208;unsubstituted benzothiazoles in moderate to good yields. &#945;&#8208;Keto acids and 2&#8208;aminothiophenols bearing different functional groups were easily transformed under the given conditions.

      <title>Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Propargylic Alcohols with 2&#8208;Ethynylanilines</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
A novel highly efficient, environmentally benign Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed, and protection&#8208;free protocol for the construction of valuable polycyclic products bearing a 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole scaffold is described, starting from readily available propargylic alcohols and 2&#8208;ethynylanilines. The one&#8208;pot transformation entails the cleavage of one C&#8722;O bond, and the construction of two C&#8722;N bonds and one C&#8722;C double bond. This unique operationally simple method is performed under mild conditions and in air, producing water as the only byproduct; it is scalable and demonstrates good functional group compatibility and broad scope.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel highly efficient, environmentally benign Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed, and protection&#8208;free protocol for the construction of valuable polycyclic products bearing a 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indole scaffold is described, starting from readily available propargylic alcohols and 2&#8208;ethynylanilines. The one&#8208;pot transformation entails the cleavage of one C&#8722;O bond, and the construction of two &lt;i&gt;C&#8722;N&lt;/i&gt; bonds and one C&#8722;C double bond. This unique operationally simple method is performed under mild conditions and in air, producing water as the only byproduct; it is scalable and demonstrates good functional group compatibility and broad scope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electrochemical Sulfonylation of Alkynes with Sulfonyl Hydrazides: A Metal&#8208; and Oxidant&#8208;Free Protocol for the Synthesis of Alkynyl Sulfones</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, an electrochemical oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction between terminal alkynes and sulfonylhydrazides has been developed. Tetrabutylammonium iodide is used as the electrolyte and redox medium. The significant advantages of this method are high atom efficiency, functional group tolerance, and transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Most of the compounds exhibit good inhibitory activity on tumor cell lines, and one of the compounds can inhibit cell migration and induce apoptosis in HeLa cells.

      <title>Continuous Flow Bioamination of Ketones in Organic Solvents at Controlled Water Activity using Immobilized &#969;&#8208;Transaminases</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Compared with biocatalysis in aqueous media, the use of enzymes in neat organic solvents enables increased solubility of hydrophobic substrates and can lead to more favorable thermodynamic equilibria, avoidance of possible hydrolytic side reactions and easier product recovery. &#969;&#8208;Transaminases from Arthrobacter sp. (AsR&#8722;&#969;TA) and Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv&#8722;&#969;TA) were immobilized on controlled porosity glass metal&#8208;ion affinity beads (EziG) and applied in neat organic solvents for the amination of 1&#8208;phenoxypropan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;propylamine. The reaction system was investigated in terms of type of carrier material, organic solvents and reaction temperature. Optimal conditions were found with more hydrophobic carrier materials and toluene as reaction solvent. The system's water activity (aw) was controlled via salt hydrate pairs during both the biocatalyst immobilization step and the progress of the reaction in different non&#8208;polar solvents. Notably, the two immobilized &#969;TAs displayed different optimal values of aw, namely 0.7 for EziG3&#8722;AsR&#8722;&#969;TA and 0.2 for EziG3&#8722;Cv&#8722;&#969;TA. In general, high catalytic activity was observed in various organic solvents even when a high substrate concentration (450&#8211;550&#8197;mM) and only one equivalent of 2&#8208;propylamine were applied. Under batch conditions, a chemical turnover (TTN) above 13000 was obtained over four subsequent reaction cycles with the same batch of EziG&#8208;immobilized &#969;TA. Finally, the applicability of the immobilized biocatalyst in neat organic solvents was further demonstrated in a continuous flow packed&#8208;bed reactor. The flow reactor showed excellent performance without observable loss of enzymatic catalytic activity over several days of operation. In general, ca. 70% conversion was obtained in 72&#8197;hours using a 1.82&#8197;mL flow reactor and toluene as flow solvent, thus affording a space&#8208;time yield of 1.99&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Conversion reached above 90% when the reaction was run up to 120&#8197;hours.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation and defluorinative aromatization strategy for the synthesis of polysubstituted 2&#8208;naphthols is reported. With ortho&#8208;bromobenzyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones as the substrates and palladium acetate/triphenylphosphine as the catalyst, this method features good functional group tolerance, readily available catalyst and starting materials, and high yields. The applications of the strategy are demonstrated by the synthesis of useful building blocks, such as naphtha[2,3&#8208;b]furan, naphthol AS&#8208;D, and ligands/catalysts.

      <title>Synthesis of Isoquinoline Derivatives via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;N Bond Activation of N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones with &#945;&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Azides</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of N&#8208;acetyl hydrazones with vinyl azides has been developed. Various substituted isoquinolines, including diverse fused isoquinolines can be prepared via this protocol in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;substituted vinyl azide serves as an internal nitrogen source. Also, C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;N bond cleavage have been realized using hydrazone as directing group.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetyl hydrazones with vinyl azides has been developed. Various substituted isoquinolines, including diverse fused isoquinolines can be prepared via this protocol in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted vinyl azide serves as an internal nitrogen source. Also, C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;N bond cleavage have been realized using hydrazone as directing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>C&#8211;H Functionalization of Aromatic Amides</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Since the beginning of the 21st century, significant progress has been made in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization of aromatic amides. The achievements in this field have mainly focused on ortho (proximal) functionalization, there have been far fewer reports on remote C&#8211;H functionalization, and para&#8208; and meta&#8208;selective functionalizations remain a major challenge. Interestingly, there are few related comments in this field. In a few published cases, the scope of the report is relatively narrow, either to comment on the functionalization of a specific directing group or to summarize the functionalization of a specific reaction site. Herein, for the first time, we have comprehensively summarized the C&#8211;H functionalization of aromatic amides. This review is divided into three parts: ortho&#8208;, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;C&#8211;H functionalization of aromatic amides, and is subdivided according to the type of catalyst. The directing groups, reaction types, conditions, mechanism and applications of the corresponding reactions are discussed in detail.

      <title>Technology Trends of Catalysts in Hydrogenation Reactions: A Patent Landscape Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The purpose of this review is to present an overview of the patent landscape for catalysts used in hydrogenation reactions. Based on patent data extracted from PatBase&#174;, we use predefined patent classifications as well as a keyword&#8208;based search for our analyses. The results indicate that the number of patent families that protect heterogeneous catalysts grows twice as fast as that for their homogeneous counterparts. Furthermore, the data show a shift towards abundant and non&#8208;toxic elements in heterogeneous catalysis, while the noble metals continue to dominate the patent landscape of homogeneous catalysis. A subsequent geographical analysis reveals that the high growth rates in heterogeneous catalysis, especially for nickel and iron, are driven by China. Conversely, patenting activities with regard to homogeneous catalysts mainly take place in the USA, the EU, and Japan. The subsequent keyword&#8208;based search illustrates the continuous industrial relevance of enantioselective hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation, as well as the rapidly increasing body of patents in hydrodeoxygenation. Setting these finding into context, we present and apply two concepts that are commonly used in patent analyses, namely the technology life cycle and the S&#8208;curve. We conclude that hydrogenation catalysis has not reached its peak economic relevance yet and will continue to spark valuable patents and innovations in the future.

      <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes as an Expedient Building Block Towards the Construction of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules: An Update</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules are the key structural constituent of many pharmaceutical compounds that play a pivotal role in drug development. Owing to their multifaceted medicinal importance, several synthetic approaches have been delineated in the recent past for their construction. Over the past few decades the augmented use of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) as three&#8208;carbon synthetic equivalents, despite their ring strain, for the construction of innumerable hetero&#8208; and carbocycles of pharmaceutical importance has raised the interest of synthetic chemists to this topic. Owing to their zwitterionic nature due to the vicinal disposition of donor and acceptor groups, they have been frequently used in ring&#8208;opening reactions, cycloadditions, and rearrangements. This review is mainly focused on assorted reactions of DACs with various nitrogen&#8208;containing dipolarophiles like imines, azides, cyanates, isothiocyanates, nitrosocarbonyls, hydrazines, diaziridines, triazinanes, diazenes, etc. towards the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules of pharmaceutical and industrial importance. This review is in continuation of our review published in the Israel Journal of Chemistry in April 2016, and includes the literature from April 2016 to May 2019.

      <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl Sulfoximines: Synthesis and Functionalizations</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we present the first synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) sulfoximines from the corresponding sulfides. Both BCPs and sulfoximines are bioisosteres used in medicinal chemistry and therefore desirable motifs. The access to BCP sulfides was enabled by the thiol addition to [1.1.1]propellane as published before. A broad scope with specific limitations was discovered for the sulfoximination. To diversify the sulfoximines, N&#8208;acylations and N&#8208;arylations were performed. As the N&#8208;arylation was low yielding we optimized the copper(I) catalyzed reaction. A wide range of aryl iodides could be deployed and competitive reactions showed that aryl bromides react equally fast. In a scale&#8208;up we prepared a suitable precursor for a BCP drug analogue. In this work several molecular structures could be determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

      <title>Boron Dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Group in Asymmetric Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloadditions for the Synthesis of Pyrrolidine&#8208;Based Biological Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
In this work, we describe the use of Boron Dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as electron&#8208;withdrawing group for activation of double bonds in asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides. The reactions take place under smooth conditions and with high enantiomeric excess for a large number of different substituents, pointing out the high activation of the alkene by using a boron dipyrromethene as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. Experimental, theoretical studies and comparison with other common electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions show the reasons of the different reactivity of the boron dipyrromethene derivatives, which can be exploited as a useful activating group in asymmetric catalysis. Additional experiments show that the so obtained pyrrolidines can be employed as biocompatible biosensors, which can be located in the endosomal compartments and do not present toxicity in three cell lines.

      <title>Divergent Reaction Pathways of &#946;&#8208;Chlorovinyl Ketones: Microwave&#8208;Assisted Thermal Nazarov Cyclization versus Cycloisomerization via Soft Vinyl Enolization</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
Divergent reaction pathways of &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones have been established to provide stereodefined alkylidenecyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;enones and 2&#8208;alkenylfuran derivatives. The switch of the reaction pathways was made possible by the microwave&#8208;assisted thermal Nazarov cyclization reaction of &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones, whereas the soft &#945;&#8208;vinyl enolization of &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones allowed the generation of allenyl ketone intermediates that in turn smoothly underwent cycloisomerization to the 2&#8208;alkenyl furan derivatives in good to excellent yields.

      <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bisindolylmethanes by Reaction of Indolylmagnesium Bromides with Sulfonyl Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Sulfonyl indoles are widely recognized as alkylideneindolenine precursors amenable to provide functionalized indole derivatives upon reaction with nucleophiles. In this paper reaction of sulfonyl indoles with indolylmagnesium bromides is used to access unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes. The target compounds are obtained in satisfactory yields starting from a wide range of substrate/reagent combinations. The utilization of pyrrolylmagnesium bromides for the same reaction also affords the expected adducts albeit in moderate yield.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
An iodine mediated base&#8208;controlled reaction between 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetate derivatives and acrylic esters has been developed for the selective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted indolizines and 1,2&#8208;disubstituted indolizines. A single&#8208;pot reaction of 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetate derivatives and acrylic esters in the presence of CsOAc delivers 1,3&#8208;disubstitued indolizines, while KHCO3 promotes the formation of C3&#8208;iodo indolizines, which could be further de&#8208;iodinated in the presence of copper powder, affording 1,2&#8208;disubstituted indolizines via a sequential stepwise fashion. A plausible reaction mechanism involving radical process has been proposed for this reaction. Pd&#8208;catalzyed reaction of C3&#8208;iodo indolizines with aryl boronic acids has been described.

Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkenylation of ferrocenecarboxylic acid has been developed. A series of 2&#8208;alkenyl ferrocenecarboxylic acids with planar chirality were obtained using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. This protocol starts from less expensive and readily available starting materials and provides the target products as a key intermediate in organic synthesis.

Abstract
A cascade procedure for the efficient and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of spiro[5.n (n=6&#8211;8)]heterocycles has been developed. This process goes through the tandem reactions of base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;expansion of cyclic ketones followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;2 spirocyclization of indoles. Easily accessible starting materials and broad substrate scope are the advantaged features of this protocol.

      <title>Rongalite&#8208;Promoted on Water Synthesis of Functionalised Tellurides and Ditellurides</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The on water reaction of sodium telluride with electrophiles has been explored. Na2Te, generated in&#8197;situ through the rongalite (sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate)&#8208;promoted reduction of elemental tellurium, reacts with a wide variety of electrophiles, including strained heterocycles, haloalkanes, Michael acceptors, and aryl diazonium salts, providing simple and rapid access to a broad range of novel functionalised symmetrical tellurides. The methodology well tolerated the presence of versatile functional groups such as alchohols, amines, esters, nitriles, and sulfones and allowed the incorporation of tellurium atoms into biologically relevant natural&#8208;derived products. Furthermore, in the case of the nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides and aziridines, a judicious tuning of the reaction conditions enabled the synthesis of unreported &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;ditellurides, which were further employed as precursors of new functionalised unsymmetrical dialkyl tellurides. The thiol&#8722;peroxidase catalytic activity of hydroxy&#8208;ditellurides has also been investigated in order to compare their antioxidant properties with those of homologous tellurides.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;on water&lt;/i&gt; reaction of sodium telluride with electrophiles has been explored. Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; through the rongalite (sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate)&#8208;promoted reduction of elemental tellurium, reacts with a wide variety of electrophiles, including strained heterocycles, haloalkanes, Michael acceptors, and aryl diazonium salts, providing simple and rapid access to a broad range of novel functionalised symmetrical tellurides. The methodology well tolerated the presence of versatile functional groups such as alchohols, amines, esters, nitriles, and sulfones and allowed the incorporation of tellurium atoms into biologically relevant natural&#8208;derived products. Furthermore, in the case of the nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides and aziridines, a judicious tuning of the reaction conditions enabled the synthesis of unreported &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;ditellurides, which were further employed as precursors of new functionalised unsymmetrical dialkyl tellurides. The thiol&#8722;peroxidase catalytic activity of hydroxy&#8208;ditellurides has also been investigated in order to compare their antioxidant properties with those of homologous tellurides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of 1&#8208;Naphthols with 1&#8208;Azadienes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalyst&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selectivity switchable enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of unprotected 1&#8208;naphthols has been established for the first time via the conjugate addition of 1&#8208;azadienes. By two chiral complementary squaramide and phosphoric acid, both ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylations of 1&#8208;naphthols were independently achieved with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. With this strategy, a wide range of optically active triarylmethanes have been achieved in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

      <title>Tandem Palladium Catalysis for Rapid Construction of 3,4&#8208;Fused Tricyclic Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Tandem catalysis, the use of a single catalyst to promote two or more mechanistically distinct cycles in one pot to assemble complex organic molecules, is an attractive target. In this paper, we report a reductant&#8208;triggered tandem palladium catalysis process that rapidly assembles 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles from three readily available starting materials. This tandem process involves a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed in&#8197;situ coupling/cyclization/Michael addition reaction to install simultaneously two functional groups at the C4 and the C3 positions of indoles. This is followed by a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization which builds a seven&#8208;membered C4, C3&#8208;bridge. Sodium formate is used to trigger the necessary switching between the palladium catalysed reactions.

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Fluorinated Monoterpenic Alkaloid Derivatives from Chiral Fluoroalkyl Aldimines via the Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
Enantioenriched fluorinated monoterpenic alkaloid analogues were synthesised, employing a strategy based on the previously undescribed diastereoselective propargylation of fluorinated tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imines, and subsequent Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction of resulting enyne derivatives, carried out both stoichiometrically and catalytically. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction tolerated both substituted alkenes and alkynes, and took place in good yields and diastereoselectivities, even when applied to a gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

Abstract
We report a protocol for redox&#8208;neutral Minisci C&#8722;H formylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes using 1,3&#8208;dioxoisoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl 2,2&#8208;diethoxyacetate as a formyl equivalent at room temperature. This scalable benchtop protocol offers a distinct advantage over traditional reductive carbonylation and Minisci C&#8722;H formylation methods in not requiring the use of carbon monoxide, pressurized gas, a stoichiometric reductant, or a stoichiometric oxidant.

Abstract
An efficient formation of synthetically and biologically relevant &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones via a photo&#8208;mediated decarboxylative ketonization of atropic acids was disclosed. The approach features metal&#8208;free conditions, good functional group compatibility, readily available starting materials and the use of ubiquitous dioxygen as both oxygen source and oxidant. Furthermore, mechanistic studies reveal that the decarboxylative ketonization reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism and may involve a radical chain reaction.

      <title>Tandem Access to Acridones and their Fused Derivatives: [1+2+3] Annulation of Isocyanides with Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>

Abstract
A wide range of acridones and their cyclo[b]&#8208;fused derivatives are efficiently constructed by a double annulation of o&#8208;enoyl arylisocyanides with &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls under simple metal&#8208;free condition. This protocol is general, efficient and practical, featuring the successive formation of two rings by a one&#8208;pot domino transformation. A tandem process involing an isocyanide&#8208;based [1+4] cycloaddition, an aminofuran&#8208;based intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition, ring opening and aromatization is proposed for the transformation.

      <title>Continuous Flow Preparation of Enantiomerically Pure BINOL(s) by Acylative Kinetic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
A polystyrene&#8208;immobilized isothiourea has been applied to the enantioselective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of monoacylated BINOL(s) with inexpensive isobutyric anhydride in batch and flow. High selectivity values (s=29 at 0&#8201;&#176;C) and a remarkable stability of the catalytic system in the operation conditions have been recorded for unsubstituted BINOL. No significant loss of activity/selectivity is recorded after 10 consecutive KR cycles in batch. A continuous flow process has been implemented and operated with a 100&#8197;mmol (32.8&#8197;g) sample of racemic monoacetylated BINOL in dichloromethane solution in an 84&#8197;hours experiment with a packed bed reactor containing 1&#8197;g (f=0.37&#8197;mmol.g&#8722;1) of the functional resin (s=17&#8211;21). Residence time can be decreased to 10&#8197;min with the same reactor to achieve a conversion of 58% with a selectivity factor s=17 when a more highly functionalized catalyst (f=0.88&#8197;mmol.g&#8722;1) is used. This translates into a remarkable combined productivity of 5.5&#8197;mmolprod&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mmolcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.

A continuous flow process has been implemented and operated with a 100&#8197;mmol (32.8&#8197;g) sample of racemic monoacetylated BINOL in dichloromethane solution in an 84&#8197;hours experiment with a packed bed reactor containing 1&#8197;g (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;=0.37&#8197;mmol.g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the functional resin (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=17&#8211;21). Residence time can be decreased to 10&#8197;min with the same reactor to achieve a conversion of 58% with a selectivity factor &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=17 when a more highly functionalized catalyst (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;=0.88&#8197;mmol.g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is used. This translates into a remarkable combined productivity of 5.5&#8197;mmol&lt;sub&gt;prod&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mmol&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zinc Acetate Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Aldol Reaction of Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
A highly enantioselective method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy esters via reductive aldol reaction of acrylates with aryl and heteroaromatic ketones is described. In situ generated catalyst composed of zinc acetate and chiral diamine afforded enantioenriched tertiary alcohols in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 91%&#8201;ee). This is also the first successful application of the zinc hydride reagent in stereoselective reductive aldol reactions of ketones.

      <title>Catalytic Intramolecular Coupling of Ketoalkenes by Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Cleavage: Synthesis of Five&#8208; and Six&#8208;Membered Carbocyclic Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
In the presence of a catalytic amount of cobalt(II) acetylacetonate/Xantphos in combination with trimethylaluminum, various ketoalkenes underwent an intramolecular cyclization reaction triggered by cleavage of the allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, affording carbocyclic compounds with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tricarbocyclic compounds were produced in good yields. One of the products thus obtained was derivatized into tramadol in four simple steps. Notably, these intramolecular cyclizations took place in the absence of a gem&#8208;disubstituent on the tethered carbon chain (without the Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect).

      <title>Recyclable Perovskite as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Aminomethylation of Imidazo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable and cost&#8208;effective protocol for direct aminomethylation of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles by decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;phenylglycines with imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles in the presence of CsPbBr3 under the irradiation of visible light has been developed. This is the first example of CsPbBr3&#8208;catalyzed aminomethylation of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles. The eminent advantage of this work is in that, CsPbBr3 is easily prepared and can be used at least 5 times without obvious reduction in its activity, exhibiting high catalyst economic feature.

      <title>New Perspectives in the Indole Ring Functionalization using 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
2&#8208;Indolylmethanols have been recently involved in several processes dealing with indole functionalization. These compounds, upon activation by Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids, generate a bidentate electrophilic system amenable to react at the 3&#8208;position or at the benzylic site with a wide range of nucleophilic reagents. The functionalization pattern is affected by the nature of the substituents at the carbinol unit and also depends on the nature of the nucleophile used. Nucleophilic reactants bearing a remote electrophilic site in their structure can be involved in a further ring closure ultimately leading to polycyclic derivatives. This review article summarizes some fundamental aspects of the chemistry of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols with particular attention to those related to asymmetric synthesis.

      <title>Deracemisation Processes Employing Organocatalysis and Enzyme Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Deracemisation methods have demonstrated their importance in the preparation of chiral compounds in the last few years. In order to resolve a racemic mixture in a dynamic sense, one enantiomer of the starting material can be converted to the other through a deracemisation procedure, that can be achieved by different mechanisms based on stereoinversion or enantioconvergence, often involving two&#8208;opposite half reactions, with at least one of the reactions being enantioselective enough to finally obtain an enantioenriched chiral compound. The focus of this comprehensive review is on the application of deracemisation procedures in the present century in order to obtain optically active valuable compounds when employing non&#8208;metallic catalysts. Thus, the review will mainly focus on the use of different enzymatic preparations (purified enzymes, cell&#8208;free extracts or whole cell systems) and organocatalysts for the deracemisation of racemic mixtures.

      <title>A 6&#960; Azaelectrocyclization Strategy towards the 1,5,9&#8208;Triazacoronenes</title>
      <dc:description>






Abstract
We present the instance of two aromatic double bonds and an imine double bond involved thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization and, on this basis, a one&#8208;step synthesis of triazacoronenes (TACs) from triphenylene&#8208;1,5,9&#8208;triamines and aldehydes under nonacidic conditions. This method has several advantages such as simplicity, high yields, and extensive substrate scope. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed with several experimental supports. A typical derivative shows a unique dimer holding together via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and six H&#8208;bonds and a zigzag superstructure stabilized by three centered H&#8208;bonds and Br&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; interaction between the adjacent dimers.

      <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Carbonyl Acridanes as Highly Potent Inhibitors of Tubulin Polymerization via One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Arylation of Nitriles with Cyclic Diphenyl Iodoniums</title>
      <dc:description>A novel Copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between six&#8208;membered cyclic diaryliodonium salts and nitriles is reported for the facile access to a variety of N&#8208;carbonyl acridanes in good to excellent yields (up to 82%). The reaction is efficient and atom&#8208;economical with a broad substrate scope (e.g. both aryl / alkyl nitriles and substituted / unsubstituted cyclic diaryliodonium salts compatible in the system). This method is particularly useful for the synthesis of substituted N&#8208;carbonyl acridanes which are present in many pharmaceutically important compounds, but are not easy to obtain in conventional approaches. Furthermore, one	of the newly synthesized acridanes displayed high antiproliferative activity against MB&#8208;468 cancer cells (IC50 = 26 nM, comparable to paclitaxel and colchicine) by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Together, these findings might grant a rapid access to a novel molecular scaffold with potential anticancer utilities.</dc:description>

      <title>Versatile Catalytic Reactions of Norbornadiene Derivatives with Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>Norbornadiene and its derivatives are important synthetic intermediates and useful building blocks in organic synthesis as they can serve as a general template to create highly substituted ring systems with high atom economy. Alkynes have always remained one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry because of their rigidity, electronic properties and numerous methods available for the functionalization of the triple bond. The different kinds of reaction between these two classes of compounds, norbornadienes and alkynes, provide useful methods for the synthesis of various important compounds/frameworks, indicating the utility of these reactions in chemical synthesis. Indeed, norbornadienes undergo various reactions with alkynes &#8211; alkynylation, ring&#8208;opening reactions, cyclization, cycloaddition reaction, Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions and other tandem reactions. This review provides an overview of the achievements in the various reactions between norbornadiene and its derivatives with alkynes.</dc:description>
