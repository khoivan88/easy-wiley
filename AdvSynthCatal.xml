      <title>Enantioselective Ammonium Ylide Mediated One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Highly Substituted &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones</title>
      <dc:description>An ammonium ylide mediated access towards trans&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;, all&#8208;trans&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#947;&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#947;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing a broad variety of functionalities was developed. Starting from widely accessible benzylidene Meldrum&#8217;s acid derivatives and &#945; bromo carbonyl compounds, &#947; butyrolactones were obtained in yields between 32&#8211;99% with up to excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;95:5) via a DABCO&#8208;mediated [2+1] annulation. Utilization of enantiomerically pure cinchona alkaloid derivatives enables the first asymmetric ammonium ylide mediated method to provide (3R,4R)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted and (2R,3R,4R)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#947;&#8208;trisubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in moderate to good yields with up to very good enantiomeric ratios (97:3). The scalability of the transformation was proven while determining the absolute configuration.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino Substituted Oxazoles from &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones and Isothiocyanates via Sequential Addition and I2&#8208;Mediated Desulfurative Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>Oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines were synthesized by annulation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones and isothiocyanates. This sequential synthetic process involves addition of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones to isothiocyanates and I2&#8208;promoted desulfurative cyclization omitting isolation of the less stable thiourea intermediates. It is transition metal&#8208;free and operationally simple, providing access to a variety of 2&#8208;amino substituted oxazole derivatives under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Versatile Catalytic Reactions of Norbornadiene Derivatives with Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Norbornadiene and its derivatives are important synthetic intermediates and useful building blocks in organic synthesis as they can serve as a general template to create highly substituted ring systems with high atom economy. Alkynes have always been one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry because of their rigidity, electronic properties and numerous methods available for functionalization of the triple bond. The different kinds of reaction between these two classes of compounds, norbornadienes and alkynes, provide useful methods for the synthesis of various important compounds/frameworks, indicating the utility of these reactions in chemical synthesis. Indeed, norbornadienes undergo various reactions with alkynes &#8211; alkynylation, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization, cycloaddition, Pauson&#8211;Khand and other tandem reactions. This review provides an overview of the achievements in the various reactions between norbornadiene and its derivatives with alkynes.

      <title>Anion&#8208;dependent imidazolium&#8208;based catalysts for allylation of aniline with tunable regioselectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free catalysts based on 1,3&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)imidazolium halides mediate the reaction between allylic alcohols and anilines, providing the corresponding N&#8208;, 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;allylaniline isomers selectively. The imidazolium counterion plays a crucial role in the outcome of the reaction. Thus, while the imidazolium chloride selectively provides the N&#8208;substituted aniline, the bromide and iodide imidazolium salts produce the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;allylaniline isomers, respectively, with excellent selectivities.A set of complementary catalysts, which are available by simple modulation, is here presented to conduct a highly regioselective allylation reaction of anilines. Not only the catalysts are synthesized in a straightforward and easily scalable manner, but they can be recycled and used under solvent&#8208;free reaction condition, due to the favorable interactions with the reactants.</dc:description>

      <title>DABCO&#8208;promoted diaryl thioether formation by metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling of sodium sulfinates and aryl iodides</title>
      <dc:description>A scalable catalytic synthesis method using commodity chemicals for constructing diaryl thioethers directly from sodium arylsulfinates and iodoarenes is reported in this study. In the presence of CuO or other copper salts such as Cu(OAc)2 as well as palladium catalysts, DABCO demonstrated to be essential to promote this transformation. Various iodoarenes and aryl sulfinates were examined and demonstrated the viability of this method. The mechanistic study showed that radical reactions occurred, while DABCO N&#8208;oxide radical can be observed by mass spectrometry. A plausible catalytic mechanism involving DABCO is also discussed, suggesting synergistic reduction of sulfinate by Cu(II) and DABCO is the key step of this coupling reaction.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A scalable catalytic synthesis method using commodity chemicals for constructing diaryl thioethers directly from sodium arylsulfinates and iodoarenes is reported in this study. In the presence of CuO or other copper salts such as Cu(OAc)2 as well as palladium catalysts, DABCO demonstrated to be essential to promote this transformation. Various iodoarenes and aryl sulfinates were examined and demonstrated the viability of this method. The mechanistic study showed that radical reactions occurred, while DABCO N&#8208;oxide radical can be observed by mass spectrometry. A plausible catalytic mechanism involving DABCO is also discussed, suggesting synergistic reduction of sulfinate by Cu(II) and DABCO is the key step of this coupling reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Acyloxy&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines generated in situ from triazoles can act as aza&#8208;[4&#8197;C] synthons and be trapped by indoles in a stepwise [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction, thus providing rapid access to valuable pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in high yields. Attractive features of this reaction system include operational simplicity, readily available substrates, construction of sterically demanding quaternary centers, and convenient derivatization using triflate.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of vinyl selenides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reactions of arylboronic acids, Se powder and diarylethylenes has been developed. The reaction proceeds via addition of in&#8197;situ generated selenium&#8208;centered radical to carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. This method highlights the use of easily accessible Se powder as selenium source in the construction of vinyl selenides for the first time.

      <title>Silylation of Aryl Chlorides by Bimetallic Catalysis of Palladium and Gold on Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Supported palladium&#8208;gold alloy&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides and hydrosilanes enabled the selective formation of aryl&#8208;silicon bonds. Whereas a monometallic palladium catalyst predominantly promoted the hydrodechlorination of aryl chlorides and gold nanoparticles showed no catalytic activity, gold&#8208;rich palladium&#8208;gold alloy nanoparticles efficiently catalyzed the title reaction to give arylsilanes with high selectivity. A wide array of aryl chlorides and hydrosilanes participated in the heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed reaction to furnish the corresponding arylsilanes in 34&#8211;80% yields. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that palladium and gold atoms on the surface of alloy nanoparticles independently functioned as active sites for the formation of aryl nucleophiles and silyl electrophiles, respectively, which indicates that palladium and gold atoms on alloy nanoparticles work together to enable the selective formation of aryl&#8208;silicon bonds.

Abstract
A robust methodology for the synthesis of phosphorothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphonothioates, including those bearing low molecular weight S&#8208;alkyl side&#8208;chains, is presented. Application of the &#8220;caesium effect&#8221; in conjunction with the disulfide 3,3&#8217;&#8208;dithiobis(propionitrile), which acts as a shelf&#8208;stable sulfur source, avoids recourse to malodorous alkanethiols and toxic P&#8722;Cl precursors. A diverse range of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus targets, including phosphorus&#8208;based heterocycles, may be prepared in consistently high yields. This chemistry also provides ready access to the corresponding DBU salts which are potential substrates for Pd&#8208;catalysed coupling reactions.

Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed photooxidation reaction via intramolecular cross dehydrogenative coupling of tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;tethered aldehydes was developed, giving the corresponding oxidative cyclization products in moderate to good yields. This reaction features mild conditions with oxygen as the terminal oxidant in the absence of photocatalyst.

Abstract
The cleavage of representative lignin systems has been achieved in a metal&#8208;free two&#8208;step sequence first employing nitrogen monoxide for oxidation followed by hydrazine for reductive C&#8722;O bond scission. In combining nitrogen monoxide and lignin, the newly developed valorization strategy shows the particular feature of starting from two waste materials, and it further exploits the attractive conditions of a Wolff&#8208;Kishner reduction for C&#8722;O bond cleavage for the first time.

Abstract
We describe a simple and sustainable MgBr2&#8208;mediated electrochemical dearomative dihydroxylation and hydroxycyclization reactions of indoles with water. MgBr2 is used in substoichiometric amount and acts as an electrolyte and potentially as a redox mediator to indirectly oxidize the indole nucleus into a bromonium ion which is involved in the aforementioned reactions.

Abstract
The bifunctional quinine&#8208;catalyzed stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition for the enantioselective construction of spirooxindole&#8208;fused cyclopenta[c]chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones is developed.

This methodology was investigated for three different alkylidene oxindole electrophiles and could also be practically demonstrated on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the (3+2) cycloaddition for the enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindole&#8208;fused cyclopenta[c]chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones is proceeding via a stepwise reaction pathway.

      <title>Efficient Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate [NADP(H)] Recycling in Closed&#8208;Loop Continuous Flow Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Biocatalytic redox reactions regularly depend on expensive cofactors that require recycling. For continuous conversions in flow chemistry, this is often an obstacle since the cofactor is washed away. Here, we present a quasi&#8208;stationary recycling system for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate utilizing an immobilized alcohol dehydrogenase. Four model substrates were reduced with high enantioselectivity as a proof of concept. The two&#8208;phase system enables continuous production as well as quick substrate changes. This setup may serve as a general cofactor regeneration module for continuous biocatalytic devices employing (co&#8208;)substrates being miscible in organic solvent. The system resulted in space&#8208;time yields up to 117&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 and total turnover numbers for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate higher than 12,000&#8197;mol/mol are possible.

      <title>Reactions of NHC&#8208;Boranes with Dibenzoyl Peroxide and Benzoic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
NHC&#8208;boranes (NHC&#8722;BH3) react slowly under thermal conditions with dibenzoyl peroxide to make mixtures of NHC&#8208;boryl mono&#8208; and dibenzoates [NHC&#8722;BH2OBz and NHC&#8722;BH(OBz)2]. Reactions are much faster under radical conditions with AIBN of TBHN as initiators. The TBHN method is especially good to make the dibenzoate. These observations led directly to the discovery that NHC&#8208;boranes also react with benzoic acid and related carboxylic acids under radical (but not thermal) conditions. Chain mechanisms for reactions with both reagents are suggested in which the key step is addition of an NHC&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen of either the peroxide or the acid.

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Fused 1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative (3+2) Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Efficient synthesis of optically active N&#8208;fused 1,3&#8208;oxazolidines containing quaternary and tertiary stereocenters was achieved via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines and vinylethylene carbonates. Using a chiral phosphoramidite ligand, the cycloadditions proceeded effectively providing sulfamidate&#8208;fused 1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in high yields (up to 96%) with stereoselectivities (up to 25:1&#8197;dr; &gt;99% ee). Additionally, the scale&#8208;up reaction and further transformations of the product were also achieved demonstrating the synthetic utility toward the construction of useful heterocycles such as chiral oxazoline bearing a quaternary stereocenter.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient synthesis of optically active N&#8208;fused 1,3&#8208;oxazolidines containing quaternary and tertiary stereocenters was achieved via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines and vinylethylene carbonates. Using a chiral phosphoramidite ligand, the cycloadditions proceeded effectively providing sulfamidate&#8208;fused 1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in high yields (up to 96%) with stereoselectivities (up to 25:1&#8197;dr; &amp;gt;99% ee). Additionally, the scale&#8208;up reaction and further transformations of the product were also achieved demonstrating the synthetic utility toward the construction of useful heterocycles such as chiral oxazoline bearing a quaternary stereocenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of N&#8208;acetyl hydrazones with vinyl azides has been developed. Various substituted isoquinolines, including diverse fused isoquinolines can be prepared via this protocol in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;substituted vinyl azide serves as an internal nitrogen source. Also, C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;N bond cleavage have been realized using hydrazone as directing group.

      <title>Divergent Reaction Pathways of &#946;&#8208;Chlorovinyl Ketones: Microwave&#8208;Assisted Thermal Nazarov Cyclization versus Cycloisomerization via Soft Vinyl Enolization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Divergent reaction pathways of &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones have been established to provide stereodefined alkylidenecyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;enones and 2&#8208;alkenylfuran derivatives. The switch of the reaction pathways was made possible by the microwave&#8208;assisted thermal Nazarov cyclization reaction of &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones, whereas the soft &#945;&#8208;vinyl enolization of &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones allowed the generation of allenyl ketone intermediates that in turn smoothly underwent cycloisomerization to the 2&#8208;alkenyl furan derivatives in good to excellent yields.

      <title>Boron Dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Group in Asymmetric Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloadditions for the Synthesis of Pyrrolidine&#8208;Based Biological Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
In this work, we describe the use of Boron Dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as electron&#8208;withdrawing group for activation of double bonds in asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides. The reactions take place under smooth conditions and with high enantiomeric excess for a large number of different substituents, pointing out the high activation of the alkene by using a boron dipyrromethene as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. Experimental, theoretical studies and comparison with other common electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions show the reasons of the different reactivity of the boron dipyrromethene derivatives, which can be exploited as a useful activating group in asymmetric catalysis. Additional experiments show that the so obtained pyrrolidines can be employed as biocompatible biosensors, which can be located in the endosomal compartments and do not present toxicity in three cell lines.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we describe the use of Boron Dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as electron&#8208;withdrawing group for activation of double bonds in asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides. The reactions take place under smooth conditions and with high enantiomeric excess for a large number of different substituents, pointing out the high activation of the alkene by using a boron dipyrromethene as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. Experimental, theoretical studies and comparison with other common electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions show the reasons of the different reactivity of the boron dipyrromethene derivatives, which can be exploited as a useful activating group in asymmetric catalysis. Additional experiments show that the so obtained pyrrolidines can be employed as biocompatible biosensors, which can be located in the endosomal compartments and do not present toxicity in three cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Rongalite&#8208;Promoted on Water Synthesis of Functionalised Tellurides and Ditellurides</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The on water reaction of sodium telluride with electrophiles has been explored. Na2Te, generated in&#8197;situ through the rongalite (sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate)&#8208;promoted reduction of elemental tellurium, reacts with a wide variety of electrophiles, including strained heterocycles, haloalkanes, Michael acceptors, and aryl diazonium salts, providing simple and rapid access to a broad range of novel functionalised symmetrical tellurides. The methodology well tolerated the presence of versatile functional groups such as alchohols, amines, esters, nitriles, and sulfones and allowed the incorporation of tellurium atoms into biologically relevant natural&#8208;derived products. Furthermore, in the case of the nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides and aziridines, a judicious tuning of the reaction conditions enabled the synthesis of unreported &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;ditellurides, which were further employed as precursors of new functionalised unsymmetrical dialkyl tellurides. The thiol&#8722;peroxidase catalytic activity of hydroxy&#8208;ditellurides has also been investigated in order to compare their antioxidant properties with those of homologous tellurides.

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Fluorinated Monoterpenic Alkaloid Derivatives from Chiral Fluoroalkyl Aldimines via the Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Enantioenriched fluorinated monoterpenic alkaloid analogues were synthesised, employing a strategy based on the previously undescribed diastereoselective propargylation of fluorinated tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imines, and subsequent Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction of resulting enyne derivatives, carried out both stoichiometrically and catalytically. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction tolerated both substituted alkenes and alkynes, and took place in good yields and diastereoselectivities, even when applied to a gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkenylation of ferrocenecarboxylic acid has been developed. A series of 2&#8208;alkenyl ferrocenecarboxylic acids with planar chirality were obtained using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. This protocol starts from less expensive and readily available starting materials and provides the target products as a key intermediate in organic synthesis.

      <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl Sulfoximines: Synthesis and Functionalizations</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we present the first synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) sulfoximines from the corresponding sulfides. Both BCPs and sulfoximines are bioisosteres used in medicinal chemistry and therefore desirable motifs. The access to BCP sulfides was enabled by the thiol addition to [1.1.1]propellane as published before. A broad scope with specific limitations was discovered for the sulfoximination. To diversify the sulfoximines, N&#8208;acylations and N&#8208;arylations were performed. As the N&#8208;arylation was low yielding we optimized the copper(I) catalyzed reaction. A wide range of aryl iodides could be deployed and competitive reactions showed that aryl bromides react equally fast. In a scale&#8208;up we prepared a suitable precursor for a BCP drug analogue. In this work several molecular structures could be determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Abstract
A novel highly efficient, environmentally benign Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed, and protection&#8208;free protocol for the construction of valuable polycyclic products bearing a 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole scaffold is described, starting from readily available propargylic alcohols and 2&#8208;ethynylanilines. The one&#8208;pot transformation entails the cleavage of one C&#8722;O bond, and the construction of two C&#8722;N bonds and one C&#8722;C double bond. This unique operationally simple method is performed under mild conditions and in air, producing water as the only byproduct; it is scalable and demonstrates good functional group compatibility and broad scope.

      <title>Continuous Flow Preparation of Enantiomerically Pure BINOL(s) by Acylative Kinetic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A polystyrene&#8208;immobilized isothiourea has been applied to the enantioselective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of monoacylated BINOL(s) with inexpensive isobutyric anhydride in batch and flow. High selectivity values (s=29 at 0&#8201;&#176;C) and a remarkable stability of the catalytic system in the operation conditions have been recorded for unsubstituted BINOL. No significant loss of activity/selectivity is recorded after 10 consecutive KR cycles in batch. A continuous flow process has been implemented and operated with a 100&#8197;mmol (32.8&#8197;g) sample of racemic monoacetylated BINOL in dichloromethane solution in an 84&#8197;hours experiment with a packed bed reactor containing 1&#8197;g (f=0.37&#8197;mmol.g&#8722;1) of the functional resin (s=17&#8211;21). Residence time can be decreased to 10&#8197;min with the same reactor to achieve a conversion of 58% with a selectivity factor s=17 when a more highly functionalized catalyst (f=0.88&#8197;mmol.g&#8722;1) is used. This translates into a remarkable combined productivity of 5.5&#8197;mmolprod&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mmolcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polystyrene&#8208;immobilized isothiourea has been applied to the enantioselective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of monoacylated BINOL(s) with inexpensive isobutyric anhydride in batch and flow. High selectivity values (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=29 at 0&#8201;&#176;C) and a remarkable stability of the catalytic system in the operation conditions have been recorded for unsubstituted BINOL. No significant loss of activity/selectivity is recorded after 10 consecutive KR cycles in batch. A continuous flow process has been implemented and operated with a 100&#8197;mmol (32.8&#8197;g) sample of racemic monoacetylated BINOL in dichloromethane solution in an 84&#8197;hours experiment with a packed bed reactor containing 1&#8197;g (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;=0.37&#8197;mmol.g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the functional resin (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=17&#8211;21). Residence time can be decreased to 10&#8197;min with the same reactor to achieve a conversion of 58% with a selectivity factor &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=17 when a more highly functionalized catalyst (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;=0.88&#8197;mmol.g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is used. This translates into a remarkable combined productivity of 5.5&#8197;mmol&lt;sub&gt;prod&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mmol&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Iodine Mediated Base&#8208;Controlled Regio&#8208;Selective Annulation of 2&#8208;(Pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetate Derivatives with Acrylic Esters for the Synthesis of Indolizines</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An iodine mediated base&#8208;controlled reaction between 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetate derivatives and acrylic esters has been developed for the selective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted indolizines and 1,2&#8208;disubstituted indolizines. A single&#8208;pot reaction of 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetate derivatives and acrylic esters in the presence of CsOAc delivers 1,3&#8208;disubstitued indolizines, while KHCO3 promotes the formation of C3&#8208;iodo indolizines, which could be further de&#8208;iodinated in the presence of copper powder, affording 1,2&#8208;disubstituted indolizines via a sequential stepwise fashion. A plausible reaction mechanism involving radical process has been proposed for this reaction. Pd&#8208;catalzyed reaction of C3&#8208;iodo indolizines with aryl boronic acids has been described.

      <title>Technology Trends of Catalysts in Hydrogenation Reactions: A&#8201;Patent Landscape Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The purpose of this review is to present an overview of the patent landscape for catalysts used in hydrogenation reactions. Based on patent data extracted from PatBase&#174;, we use predefined patent classifications as well as a keyword&#8208;based search for our analyses. The results indicate that the number of patent families that protect heterogeneous catalysts grows twice as fast as that for their homogeneous counterparts. Furthermore, the data show a shift towards abundant and non&#8208;toxic elements in heterogeneous catalysis, while the noble metals continue to dominate the patent landscape of homogeneous catalysis. A subsequent geographical analysis reveals that the high growth rates in heterogeneous catalysis, especially for nickel and iron, are driven by China. Conversely, patenting activities with regard to homogeneous catalysts mainly take place in the USA, the EU, and Japan. The subsequent keyword&#8208;based search illustrates the continuous industrial relevance of enantioselective hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation, as well as the rapidly increasing body of patents in hydrodeoxygenation. Setting these finding into context, we present and apply two concepts that are commonly used in patent analyses, namely the technology life cycle and the S&#8208;curve. We conclude that hydrogenation catalysis has not reached its peak economic relevance yet and will continue to spark valuable patents and innovations in the future.

      <title>New Perspectives in the Indole Ring Functionalization using 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
2&#8208;Indolylmethanols have been recently involved in several processes dealing with indole functionalization. These compounds, upon activation by Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids, generate a bidentate electrophilic system amenable to react at the 3&#8208;position or at the benzylic site with a wide range of nucleophilic reagents. The functionalization pattern is affected by the nature of the substituents at the carbinol unit and also depends on the nature of the nucleophile used. Nucleophilic reactants bearing a remote electrophilic site in their structure can be involved in a further ring closure ultimately leading to polycyclic derivatives. This review article summarizes some fundamental aspects of the chemistry of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols with particular attention to those related to asymmetric synthesis.

      <title>Deracemisation Processes Employing Organocatalysis and Enzyme Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Deracemisation methods have demonstrated their importance in the preparation of chiral compounds in the last few years. In order to resolve a racemic mixture in a dynamic sense, one enantiomer of the starting material can be converted to the other through a deracemisation procedure, that can be achieved by different mechanisms based on stereoinversion or enantioconvergence, often involving two&#8208;opposite half reactions, with at least one of the reactions being enantioselective enough to finally obtain an enantioenriched chiral compound. The focus of this comprehensive review is on the application of deracemisation procedures in the present century in order to obtain optically active valuable compounds when employing non&#8208;metallic catalysts. Thus, the review will mainly focus on the use of different enzymatic preparations (purified enzymes, cell&#8208;free extracts or whole cell systems) and organocatalysts for the deracemisation of racemic mixtures.

      <title>Catalytic Intramolecular Coupling of Ketoalkenes by Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Cleavage: Synthesis of Five&#8208; and Six&#8208;Membered Carbocyclic Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
In the presence of a catalytic amount of cobalt(II) acetylacetonate/Xantphos in combination with trimethylaluminum, various ketoalkenes underwent an intramolecular cyclization reaction triggered by cleavage of the allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, affording carbocyclic compounds with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tricarbocyclic compounds were produced in good yields. One of the products thus obtained was derivatized into tramadol in four simple steps. Notably, these intramolecular cyclizations took place in the absence of a gem&#8208;disubstituent on the tethered carbon chain (without the Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect).

      <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of 1&#8208;Naphthols with 1&#8208;Azadienes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalyst&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selectivity switchable enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of unprotected 1&#8208;naphthols has been established for the first time via the conjugate addition of 1&#8208;azadienes. By two chiral complementary squaramide and phosphoric acid, both ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylations of 1&#8208;naphthols were independently achieved with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. With this strategy, a wide range of optically active triarylmethanes have been achieved in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation between &#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones and 2&#8208;halophenols or 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;pyridinol is presented. The annulation process involving oxa&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;elimination and intramolecular Heck reaction leading to form 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzofurans (aryl benzofuryl sulfones) in good to high yields. The regioselective tandem construction of C&#8722;O and C&#8722;C bonds has been achieved with a variety of substitution patterns. Moreover, the tandem process is reliable at gram&#8208;scale reactions and a plausible mechanism is also proposed.

      <title>Solvent&#8208;Mediated C3/C7 Regioselective Switch in Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation of Indoles with &#945;&#8208;Ketiminoesters</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The first solvent&#8208;mediated tunable C3/C7 regio&#8208; and enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of 4&#8208;aminoindoles with &#945;&#8208;ketimino esters has been developed. This catalysis allows the highly regioselective formation of indole C3 and C7 alkylation products, both in high yields (up to 96%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Mechanism study revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions of the solvents with the catalyst played a vital role for the regioselectivity switch. Furthermore, the corresponding products are indole containing unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives bearing a quaternary stereocenter and enable many further elaborations.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation and defluorinative aromatization strategy for the synthesis of polysubstituted 2&#8208;naphthols is reported. With ortho&#8208;bromobenzyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones as the substrates and palladium acetate/triphenylphosphine as the catalyst, this method features good functional group tolerance, readily available catalyst and starting materials, and high yields. The applications of the strategy are demonstrated by the synthesis of useful building blocks, such as naphtha[2,3&#8208;b]furan, naphthol AS&#8208;D, and ligands/catalysts.

Abstract
A straightforward approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;arylallylidene)&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles has been achieved by the dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;imines with 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted allylic alcohols. This protocol employs easily accessible feedstocks to produce oxindole derivatives, which might be applicable in the dye industry. DFT calculations were carried out to gain a mechanistic insight into the reaction.

      <title>Tandem Palladium Catalysis for Rapid Construction of 3,4&#8208;Fused Tricyclic Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Tandem catalysis, the use of a single catalyst to promote two or more mechanistically distinct cycles in one pot to assemble complex organic molecules, is an attractive target. In this paper, we report a reductant&#8208;triggered tandem palladium catalysis process that rapidly assembles 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles from three readily available starting materials. This tandem process involves a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed in&#8197;situ coupling/cyclization/Michael addition reaction to install simultaneously two functional groups at the C4 and the C3 positions of indoles. This is followed by a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization which builds a seven&#8208;membered C4, C3&#8208;bridge. Sodium formate is used to trigger the necessary switching between the palladium catalysed reactions.

      <title>Synthesis of Spiro[5.n (n=6&#8211;8)]heterocycles through Successive Ring&#8208;Expansion/Indole C&#8208;2 Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A cascade procedure for the efficient and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of spiro[5.n (n=6&#8211;8)]heterocycles has been developed. This process goes through the tandem reactions of base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;expansion of cyclic ketones followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;2 spirocyclization of indoles. Easily accessible starting materials and broad substrate scope are the advantaged features of this protocol.

      <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Dehydrogenative Coupling &#8211; An Overview</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;catalysed reactions have attracted great attention recently due to the high relative abundance and cheap and eco&#8208;friendly behaviour. Applications of manganese catalysis in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling are among the hottest areas since 90% of the contributions are very recent. Dehydrogenation of alcohols using Mn&#8208;pincer systems is highly explored nowadays for cross&#8208;coupling to synthesise a variety of products and Mn&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation, and radical reactions are applied in dehydrogenative couplings of various synthons. This review focuses on the synthesis of synthetically as well as biologically important motifs such as carbonyl compounds, olefins, nitrogen heterocycles, amines, imines, etc. using manganese&#8208;catalysed dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

      <title>Enantioselective One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes via Allylic Substitution and Oxidative Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
An enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes from allyl carbonates and propargyl amines is reported. An amine catalyst promoted the allylic substitution to form intermediary N&#8208;allyl propargylamines, which underwent enantioselective Pd(II)/Pd(IV)&#8208;mediated oxidative cyclization in&#8197;situ. The chiral ligand (P,R,R)&#8208;i&#8208;Pr&#8208;SPRIX is crucial to the cyclization, producing the desired bicyclic compounds in up to 92% yield and 90% ee.

Abstract
Here, a mild and general oxidative radical relay carbocyclization reaction with 2&#8208;arylbenzoimidazoles and cyclic ethers is reported. This method provides an efficient access to a wide range of structurally diverse benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones under metal&#8208;free conditions. The wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and scale&#8208;up operation of this method are expected to promote its potential applications in biotechnology and pharmacy.

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Remote meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation by Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Steric hindrance is usually the only determining factor in controlling the enantioselectivity of a reaction. Here, we disclose a different way in which steric hindrance and electronic properties cooperate to control the transformation enantioselectivity. In this study, palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective remote meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation and alkylation via a chiral transient mediator was investigated to elucidate the mechanistic details and essence of the excellent enantioselectivity by using density functional theory methods. The calculations indicate that the deprotonation process is the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction, whereas norbornene insertion is most likely the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Although transition state structure analysis indicates that steric hindrance indeed contributes to this enantioselectivity, its individual action is insufficient to account for the excellent S&#8208;configuration selectivity. The electronic nature of substituents on the C=C double bond of norbornene as a chiral transient mediator plays a crucial role in this enantioselective conversion. A weak electron&#8208;withdrawing group is favorable for enantioselectivity, whereas strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups are exactly the opposite. Computations reveal that a weak electron&#8208;withdrawing group slightly lowers the charge density of the chiral norbornene C=C double bond, resulting in a decrease in reactivity. Especially, for the R&#8208;configuration, the insertion reaction energy barrier increases to approximately 29.3&#8197;kcal/mol. Such a high barrier is commensurate with that of the S&#8208;configuration rate&#8208;determining step (28.2&#8197;kcal/mol), thereby preventing the formation of R&#8208;configuration products and ultimately determining the enantioselectivity of the protocol.

      <title>Synthesis of Benzo[b]thiophenes through Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reaction using Elemental Sulfur</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A benzo[b]thiophene synthesis by Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction of arylboronic acids, alkynes, and elemental sulfur (S8) is developed. A notable feature of this protocol is that the thienannulation (thiophene annulation) proceeds with high regioselectivity via the sequential alkyne insertion, C&#8722;H activation, and then sulfur atom transfer to the metallacycle intermediate. In a similar manner, dibenzothiophenes can be synthesized from the parent biarylboronic acids and S8.

      <title>Cycloaddition Reactions of Azides and Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Pyrazolines, Aziridines and Other Surprises</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of organic azides and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes was investigated in a deep eutectic solvent. A series of highly substituted 2&#8208;pyrazolines was successfully isolated and their formation rationalised by DFT calculations.

      <title>Synthesis of Eight&#8208;Membered Nitrogen Heterocycles via a Heterogeneous PtI2&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cycloaddition Reaction of &#948;&#8208;Aminoalkynes with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel heterogeneous PtI2&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of &#948;&#8208;aminoalkynes was developed for the synthesis of various eight&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles in excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via a hydration of &#948;&#8208;aminoalkynes and subsequent intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition as well as ring&#8208;expansion cascade reaction with another electron&#8208;deficient alkynes. This method has the advantages of simple operation and mild reaction conditions. And the simple PtI2 with no any supports could be readily recycled through simple centrifugation without substantial loss of activity in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE). The recyclability of PtI2 may be ascribed to its insolubility in DCE. The reaction constitutes a formal [6+2]&#8208;cycloaddition.

      <title>A Thermomorphic Polyethylene&#8208;Supported Imidazolium Salt for the Fixation of CO2 into Cyclic Carbonates</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An imidazolium catalyst supported on thermomorphic polyethylene (PE) was prepared from 1&#8208;methylimidazole and polyethylene iodide (PE&#8722;I). The catalyst was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, SEC and MALDI&#8208;ToF mass spectrometry. Its catalytic activity was evaluated in the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides with carbon dioxide to give cyclic carbonates under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The catalyst proved to be active at low catalyst loading (down to 0.1&#8197;mol%) and allows the reaction to occur at low CO2 pressure (1&#8211;5&#8197;bar) and moderate temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C). A range of terminal and internal epoxides was converted to the corresponding cyclic carbonates with high yields and selectivities. The recyclability of the catalyst was studied and no significant loss of activity was observed after 5 runs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An imidazolium catalyst supported on thermomorphic polyethylene (PE) was prepared from 1&#8208;methylimidazole and polyethylene iodide (PE&#8722;I). The catalyst was characterized by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, SEC and MALDI&#8208;ToF mass spectrometry. Its catalytic activity was evaluated in the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides with carbon dioxide to give cyclic carbonates under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The catalyst proved to be active at low catalyst loading (down to 0.1&#8197;mol%) and allows the reaction to occur at low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure (1&#8211;5&#8197;bar) and moderate temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C). A range of terminal and internal epoxides was converted to the corresponding cyclic carbonates with high yields and selectivities. The recyclability of the catalyst was studied and no significant loss of activity was observed after 5 runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>From Phenylhydrazone to 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles via Nitrification, Reduction and Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we report an annulation of phenylhydrazone via a tandem nitrification, reduction, cyclization protocol employing cobalt nitrate and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to produce substituted 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. Notably, 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane serves both the solvent and a hydrogen source for transfer hydrogenation. This methodology works under mild conditions, providing a direct approach for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles.

      <title>Selective Formation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminophenyl)benzothiazoles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Isatins</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, two kinds of structurally significant 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles were selectively generated by the copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic C&#8722;C bond cleavage of isatins. Morpholine served not only as a reactant but a promoter in the three&#8208;component assembly of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles. Also it proved to be an efficient additive for the formation of free amino 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles. This protocol represents a step&#8208;economic entry to the title compounds with a range of compatible functionalities.

      <title>Phosphoramidates as Transient Precursors of Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation: Application to the Synthesis of Phthalazine Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Phosphoramidates are for the first time presented as efficient N&#8208;Centered Radical (NCR) precursors under visible&#8208;light irradiation. More precisely among this class of phosphorus&#8208;derived compounds, we studied the radical reactivity of phosphonohydrazones, under mild reaction conditions, which allowed the synthesis of a wide and diversified library of the scarcely reported phthalazine scaffold. Mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of a NCR from these brand&#8208;new phosphonohydrazones (derivatived from phosphoramidates), which were further engaged in an intramolecular 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to provide phthalazines. Compared to other pre&#8208;activated moieties, the phosphoramidate group is self&#8208;immolative, thus enhancing its attractiveness for the C&#8722;N bond formation.

In particular, the generation of radicals from sulfonium salts is a fundamental process in Nature and has been the subject of investigation for over 50 years. However, general synthetic methods that use sulfonium salts as radical precursors are rare. The advent of photoredox catalysis has triggered an upsurge of interest in the radical chemistry of sulfonium salts and this review surveys recent applications of aryl and alkyl sulfonium salts in light&#8208;mediated, radical C&#8211;C bond formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Harnessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of 2&#8208;Cyano&#8208;Substituted Heteroarenes to Achieve Programmable Double Alkylation</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report our study of tertiary radicals, generated through visible light decarboxylation, alkylating 2&#8208;cyanoarenes through radical cross&#8208;coupling at the ipso&#8208; or the para&#8208; positions of the cyano groups. Synthesis of a variety of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines containing quaternary centers is described. The approach enables regioselective sequential double alkylation on either 2&#8208;cyanopyridine or 2&#8208;cyanopyrimidine with high efficiency. Our report illustrates the synthetic utility of &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted tertiary radicals in the synthesis of substituted heteroarenes.

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reactions for the Synthesis of Norbornane&#8208;Fused Indanes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Two methods for the synthesis of norbornane&#8208;fused indanes via palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reactions of iodoarenes, norbornenes, and CH2Br2 or &#945;&#8208;diazoesters have been developed. In the reactions, three C&#8722;C bonds were constructed and a wide range of norbornane&#8208;fused indanes could be synthesized. The reactions with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters proceeded with a high degree of diastereoselectivity and indanes bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center were formed. The products obtained in the reactions of 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene can be converted to fluorenes, providing an alternative way to access fluorene derivatives.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Pyrrole Functionalization by Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
1H&#8208;Pyrroles can be directly functionalized by means of the incorporation of carbene groups from diazo compounds, in a process catalyzed by TpxCu complexes (Tpx=hydrotrispyrazolylborate ligand). The reactions take place with a complete selectivity toward the formal insertion of the carbene into the C&#945;&#8722;H bond, leading to alkylated pyrroles, with no modification of the C&#946;&#8722;H, N&#8722;H or C=C bonds of the pyrrole unit. Alkyl substituents at C&#8208;ring as well as alkyl, aryl, allyl or alkyne substitution at N atom are tolerated, the strategy affording 20 new pyrrole derivatives. The observance of partial deuteration at the methylene group when the reaction is carried out with added D2O serves to discard the direct insertion of the carbene group into the Csp2&#8722;H bond, the alternative electrophilic attack to the pyrrole ring being feasible.

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminophosphine Oxides through C(sp3)&#8722;P Coupling of 2&#8208;Azaallyls</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
Radical reactions have been widely applied in C&#8722;P bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most of these strategies require initiators, transition metal catalysts, or organometallic reagents. Herein, a transition metal&#8208;free C(sp3)&#8722;P bond formation to prepare &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides via deprotonative radical coupling processes of 2&#8208;azaallyls with chlorodiphenylphosphine oxides was presented. Deprotonation of N&#8208;benzyl imines may generate super&#8208;electron&#8208;donor (SED) 2&#8208;azaallyl anions that reduced chlorodiphenylphosphine oxides to phosphine oxide radicals. Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process transformed the 2&#8208;azaallyl anions into 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which may couple with phosphine oxide radicals to construct C&#8722;P bonds. The deprotonative radical coupling approach enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides bearing various functional groups under mild conditions and without precious transition metal catalysts or oxidants.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
The chemists&#8217; pursuit of the ideal synthesis and functionalization of indole derivatives has lasted over 150 years as their scaffolds have been widely found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic materials. In this regard, the recent resurgence of adopting green and sustainable electrochemistry in organic synthesis suggests that electrosynthesis is a promising strategy. Indeed, many new intriguing applications of synthesis and functionalization of indole derivatives by direct and redox&#8208;mediated electrochemical means have been disclosed. In this review, we highlight the fundamental aspects, reaction scopes, synthetic applications and reaction mechanisms of the electrochemical synthesis and functionalization of indole derivatives.

      <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of CF3&#8208;Containing Spirooxindoles via 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition by Dipeptide&#8208;Based Phosphonium Salt Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Reported here is an alternative method for asymmetric synthesis of the CF3&#8208;substituted 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition by employing dipeptide&#8208;based chiral phosphonium salt as a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a variety of CF3&#8208;substituted 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives were readily prepared in high yields as a single diastereomer with high enantiomeric access (&gt;20:1&#8197;dr and up to 94% ee).

      <title>Aryldiazenyl Radicals from Arylazo Sulfones: Visible Light&#8208;Driven Diazenylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A versatile protocol for the diazenylation of enol silyl ethers under visible light irradiation is presented herein. The reaction is based on the underused reaction of a nitrogen&#8208;based radical (the diazenyl radical) with an enol silyl ether. Arylazo sulfones were used as photoactivatable precursors of these diazenyl radicals. The resulting azaderivatives are potentially bioactive compounds as well as starting materials for the synthesis of N&#8208;containing heterocycles.

      <title>Radical&#8208;Induced 1,2&#8208;Migrations of Boron Ate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
1,2&#8208;Boron ate rearrangements represent a fundamental class of transformations to establish new C&#8722;C bonds while retaining the valuable boron moiety in the product. In established ionic processes, the boron ate complex is activated by an external electrophile to induce a 1,2&#8208;migration from boron to an adjacent sp3 or sp2 carbon atom. Recently, two complementary radical polar crossover approaches have been explored for both classes, 1,2&#8208;migrations to sp2 and sp3 carbon centers. This review describes the general concepts in this emerging research field and summarizes recent developments of radical&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migrations from boron to carbon.

      <title>Synthesis of Benzothiazoles via Photooxidative Decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, synthesis of benzothiazoles via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;keto acids and 2&#8208;aminothiophenols under blue LED irradiation without using any photocatalyst or metal at room temperature is described. The formation of benzothiazole is driven by the EDA (electron donor&#8208;acceptor) complex formed between &#945;&#8208;keto acid and 2&#8208;aminothiophenol. This methodology gives easy access to 2&#8208;substituted and &#8208;unsubstituted benzothiazoles in moderate to good yields. &#945;&#8208;Keto acids and 2&#8208;aminothiophenols bearing different functional groups were easily transformed under the given conditions.

      <title>Electrochemical Sulfonylation of Alkynes with Sulfonyl Hydrazides: A Metal&#8208; and Oxidant&#8208;Free Protocol for the Synthesis of Alkynyl Sulfones</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, an electrochemical oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction between terminal alkynes and sulfonylhydrazides has been developed. Tetrabutylammonium iodide is used as the electrolyte and redox medium. The significant advantages of this method are high atom efficiency, functional group tolerance, and transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Most of the compounds exhibit good inhibitory activity on tumor cell lines, and one of the compounds can inhibit cell migration and induce apoptosis in HeLa cells.

      <title>Continuous Flow Bioamination of Ketones in Organic Solvents at Controlled Water Activity using Immobilized &#969;&#8208;Transaminases</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Compared with biocatalysis in aqueous media, the use of enzymes in neat organic solvents enables increased solubility of hydrophobic substrates and can lead to more favorable thermodynamic equilibria, avoidance of possible hydrolytic side reactions and easier product recovery. &#969;&#8208;Transaminases from Arthrobacter sp. (AsR&#8722;&#969;TA) and Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv&#8722;&#969;TA) were immobilized on controlled porosity glass metal&#8208;ion affinity beads (EziG) and applied in neat organic solvents for the amination of 1&#8208;phenoxypropan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;propylamine. The reaction system was investigated in terms of type of carrier material, organic solvents and reaction temperature. Optimal conditions were found with more hydrophobic carrier materials and toluene as reaction solvent. The system's water activity (aw) was controlled via salt hydrate pairs during both the biocatalyst immobilization step and the progress of the reaction in different non&#8208;polar solvents. Notably, the two immobilized &#969;TAs displayed different optimal values of aw, namely 0.7 for EziG3&#8722;AsR&#8722;&#969;TA and 0.2 for EziG3&#8722;Cv&#8722;&#969;TA. In general, high catalytic activity was observed in various organic solvents even when a high substrate concentration (450&#8211;550&#8197;mM) and only one equivalent of 2&#8208;propylamine were applied. Under batch conditions, a chemical turnover (TTN) above 13000 was obtained over four subsequent reaction cycles with the same batch of EziG&#8208;immobilized &#969;TA. Finally, the applicability of the immobilized biocatalyst in neat organic solvents was further demonstrated in a continuous flow packed&#8208;bed reactor. The flow reactor showed excellent performance without observable loss of enzymatic catalytic activity over several days of operation. In general, ca. 70% conversion was obtained in 72&#8197;hours using a 1.82&#8197;mL flow reactor and toluene as flow solvent, thus affording a space&#8208;time yield of 1.99&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Conversion reached above 90% when the reaction was run up to 120&#8197;hours.

      <title>C&#8211;H Functionalization of Aromatic Amides</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Since the beginning of the 21st century, significant progress has been made in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization of aromatic amides. The achievements in this field have mainly focused on ortho (proximal) functionalization, there have been far fewer reports on remote C&#8211;H functionalization, and para&#8208; and meta&#8208;selective functionalizations remain a major challenge. Interestingly, there are few related comments in this field. In a few published cases, the scope of the report is relatively narrow, either to comment on the functionalization of a specific directing group or to summarize the functionalization of a specific reaction site. Herein, for the first time, we have comprehensively summarized the C&#8211;H functionalization of aromatic amides. This review is divided into three parts: ortho&#8208;, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;C&#8211;H functionalization of aromatic amides, and is subdivided according to the type of catalyst. The directing groups, reaction types, conditions, mechanism and applications of the corresponding reactions are discussed in detail.

      <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes as an Expedient Building Block Towards the Construction of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules: An Update</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules are the key structural constituent of many pharmaceutical compounds that play a pivotal role in drug development. Owing to their multifaceted medicinal importance, several synthetic approaches have been delineated in the recent past for their construction. Over the past few decades the augmented use of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) as three&#8208;carbon synthetic equivalents, despite their ring strain, for the construction of innumerable hetero&#8208; and carbocycles of pharmaceutical importance has raised the interest of synthetic chemists to this topic. Owing to their zwitterionic nature due to the vicinal disposition of donor and acceptor groups, they have been frequently used in ring&#8208;opening reactions, cycloadditions, and rearrangements. This review is mainly focused on assorted reactions of DACs with various nitrogen&#8208;containing dipolarophiles like imines, azides, cyanates, isothiocyanates, nitrosocarbonyls, hydrazines, diaziridines, triazinanes, diazenes, etc. towards the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules of pharmaceutical and industrial importance. This review is in continuation of our review published in the Israel Journal of Chemistry in April 2016, and includes the literature from April 2016 to May 2019.

      <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bisindolylmethanes by Reaction of Indolylmagnesium Bromides with Sulfonyl Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Sulfonyl indoles are widely recognized as alkylideneindolenine precursors amenable to provide functionalized indole derivatives upon reaction with nucleophiles. In this paper reaction of sulfonyl indoles with indolylmagnesium bromides is used to access unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes. The target compounds are obtained in satisfactory yields starting from a wide range of substrate/reagent combinations. The utilization of pyrrolylmagnesium bromides for the same reaction also affords the expected adducts albeit in moderate yield.

      <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Redox&#8208;Neutral Minisci C&#8722;H Formylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
We report a protocol for redox&#8208;neutral Minisci C&#8722;H formylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes using 1,3&#8208;dioxoisoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl 2,2&#8208;diethoxyacetate as a formyl equivalent at room temperature. This scalable benchtop protocol offers a distinct advantage over traditional reductive carbonylation and Minisci C&#8722;H formylation methods in not requiring the use of carbon monoxide, pressurized gas, a stoichiometric reductant, or a stoichiometric oxidant.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a protocol for redox&#8208;neutral Minisci C&#8722;H formylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heteroarenes using 1,3&#8208;dioxoisoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl 2,2&#8208;diethoxyacetate as a formyl equivalent at room temperature. This scalable benchtop protocol offers a distinct advantage over traditional reductive carbonylation and Minisci C&#8722;H formylation methods in not requiring the use of carbon monoxide, pressurized gas, a stoichiometric reductant, or a stoichiometric oxidant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Ketonization of Atropic Acids with Sulfonyl Hydrazides: Direct Access to &#946;&#8208;Ketosulfones</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
An efficient formation of synthetically and biologically relevant &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones via a photo&#8208;mediated decarboxylative ketonization of atropic acids was disclosed. The approach features metal&#8208;free conditions, good functional group compatibility, readily available starting materials and the use of ubiquitous dioxygen as both oxygen source and oxidant. Furthermore, mechanistic studies reveal that the decarboxylative ketonization reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism and may involve a radical chain reaction.

      <title>Tandem Access to Acridones and their Fused Derivatives: [1+2+3] Annulation of Isocyanides with Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A wide range of acridones and their cyclo[b]&#8208;fused derivatives are efficiently constructed by a double annulation of o&#8208;enoyl arylisocyanides with &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls under simple metal&#8208;free condition. This protocol is general, efficient and practical, featuring the successive formation of two rings by a one&#8208;pot domino transformation. A tandem process involing an isocyanide&#8208;based [1+4] cycloaddition, an aminofuran&#8208;based intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition, ring opening and aromatization is proposed for the transformation.

      <title>Zinc Acetate Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Aldol Reaction of Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
A highly enantioselective method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy esters via reductive aldol reaction of acrylates with aryl and heteroaromatic ketones is described. In situ generated catalyst composed of zinc acetate and chiral diamine afforded enantioenriched tertiary alcohols in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 91%&#8201;ee). This is also the first successful application of the zinc hydride reagent in stereoselective reductive aldol reactions of ketones.

      <title>Recyclable Perovskite as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Aminomethylation of Imidazo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable and cost&#8208;effective protocol for direct aminomethylation of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles by decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;phenylglycines with imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles in the presence of CsPbBr3 under the irradiation of visible light has been developed. This is the first example of CsPbBr3&#8208;catalyzed aminomethylation of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles. The eminent advantage of this work is in that, CsPbBr3 is easily prepared and can be used at least 5 times without obvious reduction in its activity, exhibiting high catalyst economic feature.

      <title>A 6&#960; Azaelectrocyclization Strategy towards the 1,5,9&#8208;Triazacoronenes</title>
      <dc:description>






Abstract
We present the instance of two aromatic double bonds and an imine double bond involved thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization and, on this basis, a one&#8208;step synthesis of triazacoronenes (TACs) from triphenylene&#8208;1,5,9&#8208;triamines and aldehydes under nonacidic conditions. This method has several advantages such as simplicity, high yields, and extensive substrate scope. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed with several experimental supports. A typical derivative shows a unique dimer holding together via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and six H&#8208;bonds and a zigzag superstructure stabilized by three centered H&#8208;bonds and Br&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; interaction between the adjacent dimers.
